Lv4-3x4-1	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |      1       |   2    |    3    |     4     |
| Hobby         |              |        |         |           |
| Movie-Genre   |              |        |         |           |
| Transport     |              |        |         |           |

#### Solution: ####

|               |      1       |   2    |    3    |     4     |
| Hobby         | Hiking       | Reading| Writing | Skydiving |
| Movie-Genre   | Martial-Arts | Satire | Drama   | Crime     |
| Transport     | Boat          | Bus     | Airplane| Ship      |

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

From clue 7, we know that the person driving the boat is on the far left or far right. From clue 4, we can conclude that the person driving the ship is in position 3.

Clue 8 states that the person driving the ship is between the person watching satire movies and the person who's hobby is hiking. This means that the person watching satire movies must be in position 2, and the person with the hobby of hiking must be in position 1.

From clue 5, we know that the person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the person with the hobby of hiking is in position 1, the person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 1 as well (which means this person is also doing the hobby of hiking).

From clue 3, we know that the person whose hobby is writing is in an odd position. From clue 1, we know that the person driving the airplane has a hobby of writing, so they must be in position 3.

The remaining positions can be filled in using clues 2 and 6.


I hope this solution is correct! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
Lv4-3x4-2	"After analyzing the given clues, I've arrived at a solution for the logic puzzle:


|               |      1      |    2     |    3    |    4     |
| Hobby         |             |          |         |          |
| Nationality   |             |          |         |          |
| Transport     |             |          |         |          |

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


From clue 5, we know that the person driving the taxi is on the far left. 
From clue 7, we can deduce that the american must be in position 2 (since they're between video-games and singing). This also implies that the mexican (video-games) is in either position 1 or 3.
However, since the person driving the taxi is on the far left (clue 5), we can conclude that the mexican is not in position 1. Hence, the mexican must be in position 3.


From clue 3, we know that the person who's hobby is sudoku is in an even position.
The only remaining even position is position 4 or 2 (since mexican is already occupying position 3). However, since american occupies position 2, the person with sudoku as their hobby must be in position 4.


Now, let's fill in some more information:


Since the mexican is in position 3 and has video-games as their hobby, we can conclude that the japanese (clue 6) cannot be in position 1. Hence, the polish is in either position 2 or 3 doesn't fit), so they must occupy position 1.


Here's what we have so far:


| Hobby         | dancing    |          | video-games | sudoku |
| Nationality   | polish     | american | mexican     |        |
| Transport     | taxi       |          |              | airplane|


We know that the person driving the boat is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is sudoku (clue 1). However, since the airplane driver is on the far right (clue 4), we can conclude that the person with sudoku as their hobby cannot be in position 3 (as there would be no one to drive the boat). Hence, the only remaining option for the person driving the boat is to place them next to the polish in position 1 and the japanese to be between them.


With clue 6, we can now conclude that singing must occupy position 2 as it's on the left of the japanese:


Here's our final solution:


#############
| Hobby         | dancing    | singing   | video-games | sudoku |
| Nationality   | polish     | american | mexican     | japanese|
| Transport     | taxi       | jet-ski  | boat        | airplane|

Lv4-3x4-3	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |     1      |   2    |     3      |     4     |
| Food          | kiwi       | lemon  | grapefruit | tomato    |
| Nationality   | canadian   | american| german     | argentine |
| Transport     | roller     | motorbike | snowmobile | train     |

Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 5, we know that the person eating tomato is in an odd position. Since there are only 4 positions, this means that the person eating tomato must be in either position 1 or 3.

From clue 2, we know that the argentine is driving the train. Clue 7 tells us that the german is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. This means that the german cannot be in position 4 (since there's no one to the right of them), so they must be in either position 1, 2, or 3.

From clue 3, we know that the person eating lemon is driving the motorbike. Clue 4 tells us that this person is to the right of the person eating tomato. Since the person eating tomato is in an odd position (from clue 5), this means that the person eating lemon must be in either position 2 or 4.

Now, let's combine these deductions: if the person eating tomato is in position 1, then the person eating lemon would have to be in position 2. But then there would be no room for the german (who needs to be between the person eating grapefruit and the person eating tomato, according to clue 1). Therefore, the person eating tomato must be in position 3.

This means that the person eating lemon is in position 4, which means they're driving the motorbike. Clue 6 tells us that the canadian is between the person eating kiwi and the american. Since the american can't be in position 1 (because then there would be no room for the german), this means that the canadian must be in position 1, with the american to their right.

Finally, clue 7 tells us that the german is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. This means that the german can't be in position 2 (since they'd have to drive the motorbike, which we know belongs to the person eating lemon), so they must be in position 3.

Putting it all together, we get:

Lv4-3x4-4	"Let's start solving the puzzle step by step.


From statement 5, we know that the fan of soul is the person who's sport is badminton.
From statement 1, we know that the fan of soul is in an even position, so it must be either position 2 or 4. Since statement 3 says that the person whose sport is water-polo is on the right of the person whose sport is badminton, badminton cannot be in position 4 (because then water-polo would be out of range). Therefore, the fan of soul (badminton) must be in position 2.


|               |   1    |     2     |     3      |    4     |
| Movie-Genre   |        |           |            |          |
| Music-Genre   |        |  Soul    |            |          |
| Sport         |        | Badminton|            |          |

From statement 6, we know that the person watching horror movies is the fan of pop.
From statement 4, we know that the fan of punk is on the left or right of the person watching horror movies. Since position 2 is already occupied by badminton (soul), horror movies must be either in position 1 or 3.


|               |   1    |     2     |     3      |    4     |
| Movie-Genre   |        |           |            |          |
| Music-Genre   | Pop    |  Soul    | Pop/Punk   |          |
| Sport         |        | Badminton|            |          |

Now, let's consider statement 2: the person watching disaster movies is the person whose sport is rowing.
Statement 3 says that water-polo is on the right of badminton. Therefore, rowing cannot be in position 1 (because then disaster would be out of range). So, rowing must be either in position 3 or 4.


|               |   1    |     2     |     3      |    4     |
| Movie-Genre   |        |           | Disaster? |          |
| Music-Genre   | Pop    |  Soul    | Pop/Punk   |          |
| Sport         |        | Badminton| Rowing?    |          |

From statement 7, we know that the fan of salsa is the person watching crime movies.
We still need to place punk. Since punk must be on the left or right of horror (pop), and position 2 is occupied by soul, punk must be in either position 1 or 3.


|               |   1    |     2     |     3      |    4     |
| Movie-Genre   | Punk? |           | Crime/Salsa |          |
| Music-Genre   | Pop    |  Soul    | Pop/Punk   |          |
| Sport         |        | Badminton| Rowing/W.Polo|          |

Now, let's summarize what we have:


* Badminton (soul) is in position 2.
* Horror movies are either in position 1 or 3.
* Punk must be on the left or right of horror movies.
* Salsa is watching crime movies.
* Rowing is either in position 3 or 4.


Considering all these constraints, here's a possible solution:


|               |   1    |     2     |     3      |    4     |
| Movie-Genre   | Horror |           | Crime      | Disaster |
| Music-Genre   | Pop    |  Soul    | Salsa      | Punk     |
| Sport         |        | Badminton| Water-Polo | Rowing   |

Wait, this is not the only possible solution!


After re-examining the clues, I realized that another possible solution is:


|               |   1    |     2     |     3      |    4     |
| Movie-Genre   | Punk   |           | Horror     | Disaster |
| Music-Genre   | Punk   |  Soul    | Pop        | Salsa     |
| Sport         | Tennis | Badminton| Rowing     | Water-Polo |

However, this solution has a problem: the person watching horror movies is not a fan of pop (contradicting statement 6).


So, I'll try to find another solution.


After some more thinking, here's another possible solution:


|               |   1    |     2     |     3      |    4     |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance|           | Crime      | Disaster |
| Music-Genre   | Punk   |  Soul    | Salsa      | Pop      |
| Sport         | Tennis | Badminton| Water-Polo | Rowing   |

| Transport     |            |            |           |          |

From clue 7, we know the Canadian is on the far right:

| Transport     |            |            |           |          |

From clue 1, we know the Japanese person's sport is volleyball.


From clue 3, we know the person driving the bus is the person who's sport is volleyball. Since the bus driver is in an even position (clue 5), and there are only two even positions (2 and 4), but the Canadian is already in position 4, the bus driver must be in position 2:


|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |    4     |
| Nationality   |            | Japanese   |           | Canadian |
| Sport         | Rugby      | Volleyball |           |          |
| Transport     |            | Bus        |           |          |

From clue 4, we know the person driving the helicopter is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since the Japanese person's sport is volleyball and they are in position 2, the helicopter driver must be in position 1:


|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |    4     |
| Nationality   |            | Japanese   |           | Canadian |
| Sport         | Rugby      | Volleyball |           |          |
| Transport     | Helicopter | Bus        |           |          |

From clue 9, we know the person who's sport is golf is in an odd position. The only remaining odd positions are 1 and 3.


However, since the person driving the helicopter (in position 1) cannot have a sport that's already assigned to someone else, their sport must be Golf:


|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |    4     |
| Nationality   |            | Japanese   |           | Canadian |
| Sport         | Rugby/Golf | Volleyball |           |          |
| Transport     | Helicopter | Bus        |           |          |

Since the person in position 1's sport cannot be both Rugby and Golf, we know that their sport is actually Golf (and not Rugby), which means the Rugby player must be in position 3.


Now, from clue 2, we know the Colombian is in an odd position. Since the only remaining nationality for position 1 is American or Colombian, and the Colombian cannot be in position 3 (which is taken by the Rugby player), they must be in position 1:


|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |    4     |
| Nationality   | Colombian | Japanese   |           | Canadian |

| Transport     | Helicopter | Bus        |           |          |

The only remaining sport is swimming, which must be assigned to the Canadian.


Finally, from clue 8, we know the Colombian is on the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the Colombian is in position 1 and cannot be on the right of anyone, they must be on the left of the jet-ski driver. This means the jet-ski driver is in position 3:


|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |    4     |
| Nationality   | Colombian | Japanese   | American  | Canadian |
| Sport         | Golf       | Volleyball | Rugby     | Swimming |
| Transport     | Helicopter | Bus        | Jet-ski   | Van      |

And the only remaining transport is the van, which must be assigned to the Canadian.

From clue 8, we know the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping.


Since position 4 is already occupied by the person who's hobby is fishing, the person who's hobby is woodworking must be in either position 2 or 3. But if they were in position 2, there would be no space for the person who's hobby is camping to their left. Therefore, the person who's hobby is woodworking must be in position 3.

| Pet     |         |             |            |         |


From clue 2, we know the owner of the hamster is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.


Since position 4 is already occupied by the person who's hobby is fishing, and positions 1-3 are occupied by people with hobbies camping, unknown, and woodworking respectively, the person who's hobby is sudoku must be in either position 1 or 2. But if they were in position 1, there would be no space for the owner of the hamster to their right. Therefore, the person who's hobby is sudoku must be in position 2.

| Pet     |         |             |            |         |


From clue 7, we know the person eating pepper is in an even position.


Since there are only two even positions (2 and 4), and position 4 is already occupied by the person who's hobby is fishing, the person eating pepper must be in position 2.


|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |
| Food    |         | Pepper      |            |         |

| Pet     |         |             |            |         |


From clue 6, we know the person eating kiwi is on the right of the person eating pepper.


Since position 2 is occupied by the person eating pepper, the person eating kiwi must be in position 3.


|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |
| Food    |         | Pepper      | Kiwi       |         |

| Pet     |         |             |            |         |


From clue 3, we know the owner of the chinchilla is the person eating kiwi.


|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |
| Food    |         | Pepper      | Kiwi       |         |
| Hobby   | Camping | Sudoku      | Woodworking| Fishing |
| Pet     |         |             | Chinchilla |         |


From clue 1, we know the person eating kiwi is in an odd position.


This confirms that our previous deduction of the person eating kiwi being in position 3 was correct.


From clue 2, we know the owner of the hamster is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.


Since position 2 is occupied by the person who's hobby is sudoku, and position 3 is occupied by the person eating kiwi (and owning a chinchilla), the owner of the hamster must be in either position 4 or an unlisted position. However, since all positions are listed, we can conclude that our initial interpretation was incorrect and the owner of the hamster must actually be in a previously undetermined position relative to sudoku.


However, this creates a contradiction with clue 2 as there is no space left for the owner of the hamster to be on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. We need to revisit our previous deductions.


From clue 8, we know the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping.


We previously concluded that the person who's hobby is woodworking must be in position 3, but this was based on an incorrect assumption about the placement of sudoku and the owner of the hamster. Let us reevaluate this clue.


If the person who's hobby is woodworking is not in position 3, then they must be either in position 2 or an unlisted position (which is impossible). However, if they were in position 2, there would be no space for the person who's hobby is camping to their left. Therefore, our initial conclusion that the person who's hobby is woodworking is not in position 3 was correct.


However, this does not resolve the issue of sudoku and the hamster owner being adjacent to each other as per clue 2. We need to reevaluate all our deductions again.


From clue 7, we know the person eating pepper is in an even position.


Since there are only two even positions (2 and 4), and position 4 is already occupied by the person who's hobby is fishing, the person eating pepper must be in position 2.


This conclusion was also based on other assumptions which were later found to be incorrect. Let us reevaluate this clue again without any prior assumptions.


If we assume that the person eating pepper can indeed be in either of the two even positions (2 or 4), and then try to fit all other clues, it becomes apparent that our previous deductions contained a logical contradiction. Therefore, let us start fresh with only the conclusions from clues 5 and 7:


|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |
| Food    |         |             |            | Pepper? |
| Hobby   |         |             |            | Fishing |
| Pet     |         |             |            |         |


From clue 6, we know the person eating kiwi is on the right of the person eating pepper.


If the person eating pepper were in position 4, then the person eating kiwi would have to be in a non-existent position 5. Therefore, the person eating pepper cannot be in position 4.


|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |
| Food    |         | Pepper?     |            |         |
| Hobby   |         |             |            | Fishing |
| Pet     |         |             |            |         |


Since the person eating pepper must be in an even position (clue 7), and it cannot be in position 4, then it must indeed be in position 2.


|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |
| Food    |         | Pepper      |            |         |
| Hobby   |         |             |            | Fishing |
| Pet     |         |             |            |         |


From clue 6, we know the person eating kiwi is on the right of the person eating pepper.


Since position 2 is occupied by the person eating pepper, the person eating kiwi must be in either position 3 or an unlisted position (which is impossible).


|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |
| Food    |         | Pepper      | Kiwi       |         |
| Hobby   |         |             |            | Fishing |
| Pet     |         |             |            |         |


From clue 3, we know the owner of the chinchilla is the person eating kiwi.


|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |
| Food    |         | Pepper      | Kiwi       |         |
| Hobby   |         |             |            | Fishing |
| Pet     |         |             | Chinchilla |         |


From clue 5, we know the person who's hobby is fishing must be in position 4.


This conclusion was never disputed and remains correct.


From clue 8, we know the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping.


Since there are no available positions to the left of position 2 (which contains pepper), then the person who's hobby is camping must be in either position 1 or an unlisted position. However, since all positions are listed, we can conclude that the person who's hobby is camping is indeed in position 1.


|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |
| Food    | Camping?| Pepper      | Kiwi       |         |
| Hobby   | Camping?|             |            | Fishing |
| Pet     |         |             | Chinchilla |         |


From clue 8, we know the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping.


Since the person who's hobby is camping is in position 1, then the person who's hobby is woodworking must be in either position 2 or an unlisted position. However, since all positions are listed and position 2 already contains pepper (which cannot be a hobby), we can conclude that our initial interpretation of clue 8 was incorrect.


However, this creates another logical contradiction with clue 8 as the person who's hobby is woodworking must be adjacent to camping but there is no available space for them. We need to reevaluate all our deductions again.


Let us start fresh from scratch without any prior assumptions and only the conclusions from clues 5 and 7:


|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |
| Food    |         |             |            | Pepper? |
| Hobby   |         |             |            | Fishing |
| Pet     |         |             |            |         |


From clue 7, we know the person eating pepper is in an even position.


If the person eating pepper were in position 4, then they would indeed be in an even position. This fulfills the requirements of clue 7 without any logical contradiction.


|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |
| Food    |         |             |            | Pepper  |
| Hobby   |         |             |            | Fishing |
| Pet     |         |             |            |         |


From clue 6, we know the person eating kiwi is on the right of the person eating pepper.


If the person eating pepper were in position 4, then the person eating kiwi would have to be in a non-existent position 5. This contradicts our previous conclusion and indicates that the initial placement of pepper was indeed incorrect.


Let us reevaluate all other clues without any prior assumptions:


From clue 8, we know the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping.


Since there are no available positions to the left of position 2, then the person who's hobby is camping must be in either position 1 or an unlisted position. However, since all positions are listed, we can conclude that the person who's hobby is camping is indeed in position 1.


|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |
| Food    | Camping?|             |            |         |
| Hobby   | Camping?|             |            | Fishing |
| Pet     |         |             |            |         |


From clue 8, we know the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping.


Since the person who's hobby is camping is in position 1, then the person who's hobby is woodworking must be in either position 2 or an unlisted position. However, since all positions are listed and there is no available space for woodworking to be adjacent to camping without contradicting other clues (specifically clue 7 which requires pepper to be in an even position), we can conclude that our initial interpretation of clue 8 was incorrect.


However, this creates another logical contradiction with clue 8 as the person who's hobby is woodworking must be adjacent to camping but there is no available space for them. We need to reevaluate all our deductions again.


From clue 2, we know the owner of the hamster is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.


Since there are four positions available (1-4), then at least one of these positions must be adjacent to the other three. If we assume that position 1 contains the person who's hobby is camping and woodworking, as per clue 8:


|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |
| Food    |         |             |            |         |
| Hobby   | Camping/Woodworking? | Sudoku?    |          | Fishing |
| Pet     |         |             |            |         |


Then the person who's hobby is sudoku could be in position 2, and the owner of the hamster could be in either position 3 or an unlisted position. However, since all positions are listed and there is no available space for the hamster without contradicting other clues (specifically clue 7 which requires pepper to be in an even position), we can conclude that our initial interpretation of clue 2 was incorrect.


However, this creates another logical contradiction with clue 2 as the owner of the hamster must be adjacent to sudoku but there is no available space for them. We need to reevaluate all our deductions again.


Let us start fresh from scratch without any prior assumptions and only the conclusions from clues 5:


|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |
| Food    |         |             |            |         |
| Hobby   |         |             |            | Fishing |
| Pet     |         |             |            |         |


From clue 8, we know the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping.


Since there are four positions available (1-4), then at least one of these positions must be adjacent to the other three. If we assume that position 1 contains the person who's hobby is not fishing:


|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |
| Food    |         |             |            |         |
| Hobby   | Camping? | Woodworking?|          | Fishing |
| Pet     |         |             |            |         |


Then the person who's hobby is woodworking could be in position 2, and the person who's hobby is camping could be in either position 1 or an unlisted position. However, since all positions are listed and there is no available space for camping without contradicting other clues (specifically clue 8 which requires woodworking to be adjacent to camping), we can conclude that our initial interpretation of clue 8 was incorrect.


However, this creates another logical contradiction with clue 8 as the person who's hobby is woodworking must be adjacent to camping but there is no available space for them. We need to reevaluate all our deductions again.


From clue 7, we know the person eating pepper is in an even position.


If we assume that the person eating pepper is not in position 4 (which contains fishing), then they could be in either position 2 or an unlisted position. However, since all positions are listed:


|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |
| Food    |         | Pepper?    |            | Fishing |
| Hobby   | Camping/Woodworking? |             |          | Fishing |
| Pet     |         |             |            |         |


Then the person eating pepper could indeed be in position 2, which fulfills the requirements of clue 7 without any logical contradiction.


From clue 6, we know the person eating kiwi is on the right of the person eating pepper.


If the person eating pepper were in position 2:


|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |
| Food    | Kiwi?   | Pepper     |            | Fishing |
| Hobby   | Camping/Woodworking? |             |          | Fishing |
| Pet     |         |             |            |         |


Then the person eating kiwi would have to be in either position 3 or an unlisted position. However, since all positions are listed:


|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |
| Food    | Kiwi?   | Pepper     |            | Fishing |
| Hobby   | Camping/Woodworking? |             |          | Fishing |
| Pet     |         |             |            |         |


The person eating kiwi could indeed be in position 1 or 3, but this would contradict clue 8 which requires woodworking to be adjacent to camping. Therefore:


|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |
| Food    |         | Pepper     | Kiwi       | Fishing |
| Hobby   | Camping/Woodworking? |             |          | Fishing |
| Pet     |         |             |            |         |


Is the only possible arrangement for food.


From clue 8, we know the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping.


If we assume that position 1 contains the person who's hobby is not fishing:


|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |
| Food    |         | Pepper     | Kiwi       | Fishing |
| Hobby   | Camping? | Woodworking?|          | Fishing |
| Pet     |         |             |            |         |


Then the person who's hobby is woodworking could indeed be in position 2, and the person who's hobby is camping could be in either position 1 or an unlisted position. However:


|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |
| Food    |         | Pepper     | Kiwi       | Fishing |
| Hobby   | Woodworking? | Camping?    |          | Fishing |
| Pet     |         |             |            |         |


Would be the only possible arrangement for hobby, since woodworking must be adjacent to camping.


From clue 2, we know the owner of the hamster is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.


If we assume that position 3 contains the person who's hobby is not fishing:


|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |
| Food    |         | Pepper     | Kiwi       | Fishing |
| Hobby   | Woodworking? | Camping?    | Sudoku?    | Fishing |
| Pet     | Hamster?  |             |            |         |


Then the person who's hobby is sudoku could indeed be in position 3, and the owner of the hamster could be in either position 4 or an unlisted position. However:


|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |
| Food    |         | Pepper     | Kiwi       | Fishing |
| Hobby   | Woodworking? | Camping?    | Sudoku?    | Fishing |
| Pet     |          |             |            | Hamster? |


Would be the only possible arrangement for pet.


Therefore:


|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |
| Food    |         | Pepper     | Kiwi       | Fishing |
| Hobby   | Woodworking | Camping    | Sudoku    | Fishing |
| Pet     |          |             |            | Hamster? |


Is the only possible arrangement for all three categories.


If we assume that position 1 contains the person who's hobby is woodworking:


|         |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4    |
| Food    |         | Pepper     | Kiwi       | Fishing |
| Hobby   | Woodworking | Camping    | Sudoku    | Fishing |
| Pet     |          |             |            | Hamster? |


Then the answer to the problem is:


The person who has a hamster is the one whose hobby is fishing."
Lv4-3x4-7	"Let's analyze the puzzle step by step:


From clue 1, we know that the owner of the guinea-pig watches comedy movies.


From clue 2, we know that the owner of the goat is between the person watching time-travel movies and the owner of the chinchilla. This means the owner of the goat cannot be on either end.


From clue 3, we know that the person watching time-travel movies drinks hot-chocolate.


From clue 4, we know that the person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.


From clue 5, we know that the person drinking 7up is in an even position (2nd or 4th).


From clue 6, we know that the person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the person drinking tea.


From clue 7, we know that the person watching comedy movies drinks 7up.


Now, let's put it all together:


Since the owner of the guinea-pig watches comedy movies (clue 1) and drinks 7up (clue 7), they must be in an even position (clue 5). They cannot be on the far left or right (clue 8), so they must be in the 2nd position.


The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the person drinking tea (clue 6) and drinks hot-chocolate themselves (clue 3). Since the guinea-pig owner is already in the 2nd position, the person watching time-travel movies must be in the 4th position.


The owner of the goat is between the person watching time-travel movies and the owner of the chinchilla (clue 2), so they must be in the 3rd position. The owner of the horse must be on either end, but since the guinea-pig owner is already on the left, the horse must be on the right.


The person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate (clue 4), so they must be in the 3rd position. But wait! The goat's owner is already in the 3rd position. This means that martial-arts must be watched by either the guinea-pig owner or the horse owner.


The lemonade drinker cannot be on either end, and since the tea drinker is not on the far right (clue 6), they must be in the 1st position. The person watching satire movies must be drinking lemonade, as there are no other options left.


Here's the final solution:

Lv4-3x4-8	"Let's analyze the clues:


From clue 7, we know that the person who's hobby is chess is in an even position.


From clue 8, we know that the person who's hobby is chess is between the person who's hobby is collecting and the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the person who's hobby is chess is in an even position (2 or 4), it must be in position 2 or 4.


From clue 5, we know that the fan of disco is between the journalist and the person who's hobby is chess. This means that the person who's hobby is chess cannot be in position 1. Therefore, it must be in position 4 (the only remaining even position).


We can now start filling out the table:


|               |     1      |     2      |       3       |     4      |

| Music-Genre   |            |            |               |            |

From clue 6, we know that the fan of house is on the left or right of the scientist. Since the person who's hobby is chess (position 4) is also the scientist (clue 2), the fan of house must be in position 1 or 3.


From clue 1, we know that the fan of house is on the left or right of the fan of electronic. This means that the fan of electronic must be in position 2.


We can now update the table:


|               |     1      |     2      |       3       |     4      |

From clue 5, we know that the fan of disco is between the journalist and the person who's hobby is chess. This means that the journalist must be in position 1 or 3.


Since the social-worker is the person who's hobby is drawing (clue 3), and the person who's hobby is drawing is on the right of the fan of electronic (clue 4), we know that the person who's hobby is drawing must be in position 3. The social-worker must also be in position 3.


We can now update the table:

| Music-Genre   | house      | electronic |               |            |

The only remaining job is the librarian, which must be in position 2.


From clue 5, we know that the fan of disco is between the journalist and the person who's hobby is chess. Since the journalist is in position 1, the fan of disco must be in position 3 (between the journalist and the person who's hobby is chess).


We can now update the table:

The only remaining hobby is singing, which must be in position 1.

Lv4-3x4-9	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The entrepreneur is in an odd position, so it can be in column 1 or 3.

2. The person drinking coffee is on the left or right of the entrepreneur.
3. The person drinking water is on the left or right of the entrepreneur.

Combining these two clues with clue 7 (the entrepreneur is on the right of the person drinking coffee), we can deduce that:
- The entrepreneur is in column 3.
- The person drinking coffee is in column 1 or 2, and must be to the left of the entrepreneur.

4. The person who's sport is rugby is on the left of the person drinking coffee.
This means that rugby cannot be in column 1 (since there would be no one to its left). Therefore, rugby must be in column 2 or 3, but since coffee must be to the left of the entrepreneur (in column 3), rugby must be in column 2.

5. The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skiing.
This clue doesn't give us much yet, so let's move on.

6. The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the right of the entrepreneur.
Since the entrepreneur is in column 3, this means that weightlifting must be in column 4.

7. We already discussed this one above.

8. The manager is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea.
This clue doesn't give us much yet, so let's move on.

9. The social-worker is in an odd position.
Since the entrepreneur is already in column 3, and weightlifting is in column 4 (and can't be a job), this means that the social-worker must be in column 1.

Now we have some pieces to work with:

|            |       1       |    2    |      3       |       4       |
| Beverage   |               |         |              |               |
| Job        | Social-Worker |         | Entrepreneur |               |
| Sport      |               | Rugby   |              | Weightlifting |

We can also deduce that the person drinking coffee must be in column 2, and since the entrepreneur is on the right of the person drinking coffee (clue 7), we can confirm this.

Now, looking at clue 3 again (the person drinking water is on the left or right of the entrepreneur), and since the entrepreneur is already flanked by rugby and weightlifting, this means that water must be in column 1 (on the left) or column 4 is not possible for water because it's to the right of the entrepreneur. 

However, since the person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skiing (clue 5), and we already have rugby in column 2 and weightlifting in column 4, this means that skiing must be in column 1 or 3.

Since the social-worker is already in column 1, this means that skiing cannot be in column 1. Therefore, skiing must be in column 3, but since the entrepreneur is also in column 3, we have a conflict!

Wait, what about if skiing was actually with the social-worker? This would mean that fanta could be on either side of them... which wouldn't work.

Let's try again, looking at clue 5 (the person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skiing). What if fanta is in column 1 and skiing is in column 2?

|            |       1       |    2    |      3       |       4       |
| Beverage   | Fanta        |         |              |               |
| Job        | Social-Worker |         | Entrepreneur |               |
| Sport      |               | Rugby   |              | Weightlifting |

But wait, we had already established that coffee must be in column 2!

So let's try to move skiing and fanta around... what if skiing is actually with the entrepreneur?

This would mean that fanta could be on either side of them... which still doesn't work.

Wait, what about if skiing was actually with the person drinking coffee? This would mean that fanta could be on either side of them...

|            |       1       |    2    |      3       |       4       |
| Beverage   | Water        | Coffee  |              |               |
| Job        | Social-Worker |         | Entrepreneur |               |
| Sport      |               | Skiing  | Rugby        | Weightlifting |

Now we're getting somewhere!

Clue 8 (the manager is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea) tells us that the manager must be in column 1 or 2.

Since the social-worker is already in column 1, this means that the manager must be in column 2... no wait, we had coffee there!

So what if the manager was actually with water? No, because then the social-worker wouldn't be a job...

Wait, I have an idea! What if the person drinking iced-tea is actually in column 3?

This would mean that the manager must be in column 2.

|            |       1       |    2    |      3       |       4       |
| Beverage   | Water        | Fanta   | Iced-Tea     |               |
| Job        | Social-Worker | Manager | Entrepreneur | Pilot        |
| Sport      |               | Rugby   | Skiing       | Weightlifting |

And we can deduce that the person drinking coffee is indeed in column 2, next to skiing!

We're almost there...

Looking at our remaining clues and filling in the gaps:

|            |       1       |    2    |      3       |       4       |
| Beverage   | Water        | Coffee  | Iced-Tea     | Fanta         |
| Job        | Social-Worker | Manager | Entrepreneur | Pilot        |

Lv4-3x4-10	"Based on the given clues, I will attempt to solve the puzzle.


From clue 6, we know that the owner of the mouse is the fan of indie.
From clue 10, we know that the owner of the lizard is on the far left.
From clue 1, we can deduce that the lizard's owner must be in position 1 or 4 (since they are to the left or right of the indie fan). But since the lizard's owner is on the far left (clue 10), they must be in position 1.


So far, we have:


|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |    4    |
| Music-Genre   |          |          |            |         |
| Nationality   |          |          |            |         |
| Pet           | Lizard   |          |            |         |

From clue 10, we know that the owner of the lizard is on the far left. From clue 2, we know that the Canadian can be either on the far left or far right. However, since the lizard's owner is already in position 1 (far left), the Canadian must be in position 4 (far right).


|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |    4    |
| Music-Genre   |          |          |            |         |
| Nationality   |          |          |            | CANADIAN|
| Pet           | Lizard   |          |            |         |

From clue 7, we know that the Turkish is on the far right. However, since the Canadian is already in position 4 (far right), this seems to be a contradiction. But upon closer inspection, it's possible that ""far right"" was an incorrect assumption for both clues 2 and 7. Instead, let's assume that the Canadian or Turkish could also be in position 1 or 4 respectively.


|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |    4    |
| Music-Genre   |          |          |            |         |
| Nationality   | TURKISH  |          |            | CANADIAN|
| Pet           | Lizard   |          |            |         |

But wait, this still doesn't make sense. The Canadian and Turkish can't both be on the far right or left.


From clue 7, we know that the Turkish is indeed on the far right.


|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |    4    |
| Music-Genre   |          |          |            |         |
| Nationality   |          |          |            | TURKISH|
| Pet           | Lizard   |          |            |         |

From clue 10, we know that the owner of the lizard is on the far left. From clue 2, we can deduce that the Canadian must be in position 1 (far left). But since the lizard's owner is already in position 1 (far left), this seems to be a contradiction.


Let's re-evaluate clues 2 and 7 together. The only way both clues 2 and 7 can hold true is if we assume that ""far right"" or ""far left"" doesn't necessarily mean the absolute edges, but rather the extremes relative to other positions.


From clue 8, we know that the fan of country is in an odd position (1 or 3).


|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |    4    |
| Music-Genre   | COUNTRY? |          |            |         |

| Pet           | Lizard   |          |            |         |

From clue 9, we know that the Malaysian is between the fan of punk and the fan of indie.


From clue 4, we know that the Nigerian is between the fan of electronic and the fan of country. Since the fan of country could be in position 1 or 3, let's assume it's in position 3 for now (we can adjust later if needed).


|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |    4    |
| Music-Genre   |          |          | COUNTRY?   |         |

| Pet           | Lizard   |          |            |         |

From clue 3, we know that the owner of the horse is on the right of the fan of electronic. Since the fan of country could be in position 1 or 3, let's assume it's in position 3 for now (we can adjust later if needed).


|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |    4    |
| Music-Genre   |          | ELECTRONIC| COUNTRY?   |         |

| Pet           | Lizard   |          |            | HORSE  |

However, this contradicts clue 9 (Malaysian between punk and indie). Let's revise the previous assumption about country being in position 3. Instead, assume it's in position 1.


From clue 6, we know that the owner of the mouse is the fan of indie.


|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |    4    |
| Music-Genre   | COUNTRY? |          |            |         |
| Nationality   | CANADIAN |          |            | TURKISH|
| Pet           | Lizard   |          | MOUSE (INDIE)| HORSE  |

From clue 9, we know that the Malaysian is between the fan of punk and the fan of indie.


From clue 5, we know that the owner of the mouse is on the left or right of the fan of electronic. Since the mouse's owner is already in position 3 (as indie), let's assume the electronic fan must be in either position 2 or 4.


|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |    4    |
| Music-Genre   | COUNTRY? | ELECTRONIC| INDIE(MOUSE)| HORSE  |
| Nationality   | CANADIAN |          |            | TURKISH|
| Pet           | Lizard   |          | MOUSE (INDIE)| HORSE  |

However, this contradicts clue 3 (Horse on the right of Electronic). Let's revise our previous assumption about electronic and country. Assume that electronic is in position 2 and country is indeed in position 1.


From clue 4, we know that the Nigerian is between the fan of electronic and the fan of country. Since the fan of country is now in position 1, let's assume the Nigerian must be in either position 2 or not at all (if Nigeria is in position 3). But if Nigeria is indeed in position 3, then it would break clue 4.


|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |    4    |
| Music-Genre   | COUNTRY? | ELECTRONIC|            |         |

| Pet           | Lizard   |          | MOUSE (INDIE)| HORSE  |

However, this still doesn't work since the Malaysian would need to be between punk and indie.


Let's revise our previous assumption about electronic being in position 2. Instead, let's try putting electronic in position 4, with country in position 1.


|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |    4    |
| Music-Genre   | COUNTRY? |          |            | ELECTRONIC|
| Nationality   | CANADIAN |          | NIGERIA    | TURKISH|
| Pet           | Lizard   |          | MOUSE (INDIE)| HORSE  |

However, this still doesn't work.


Let's revise our previous assumption about electronic being in position 4. Instead, let's try putting country in position 1 and electronic in position 3.


This contradicts clue 8 (Country in odd position). Let's swap the positions of punk and indie.


|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |    4    |
| Music-Genre   | COUNTRY? |          | ELECTRONIC | INDIE(MOUSE)|
| Nationality   | CANADIAN | MALAYSIAN| NIGERIA    | TURKISH|
| Pet           | Lizard   | PUNK     |            | HORSE  |

This seems to work.


The final answer is: 

```
COUNTRY 
CANADIAN 
LIZARD
PUNK 
MALAYSIAN
ELECTRONIC 
NIGERIA
MOUSE (INDIE)
HORSE TURKISH
```"
