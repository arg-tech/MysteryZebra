Lv4-1x4-1	"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

From clue 1: The Russian is in an odd position. Since there are only 4 positions (1, 2, 3, and 4), this means that the Russian must be in either position 1 or position 3.

From clue 2: The Turkish person is between the German and the Russian. This implies that the Turkish person cannot be in an odd position (since they are ""between"" two other people). Therefore, the Turkish person must be in either position 2 or position 4.

However, from clue 3: The Turkish person is on the right of the German. Since the Turkish person is between the German and the Russian, this means that the German must be to the left of the Turkish person, which places the Turkish person in a higher-numbered position than the German.

Putting all these clues together:

The only possible arrangement is:
German (1) - Turkish (2) - Russian (3) - Thai (4)

Here's the solution table with '#############' around it:


|               |   1    |    2    |    3    |  4   |
| Nationality   | German | Turkish | Russian | Thai |

Lv4-1x4-2	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person eating avocado is on the left of the person eating potato.
This means that Avocado < Potato.

2. The person eating banana is in an odd position (1 or 3).

3. The person eating banana is on the left or right of the person eating avocado.
This means that Banana and Avocado are adjacent to each other, with Banana possibly being on either side of Avocado.

Let's try to combine these clues:

* If Banana is at position 1, then Avocado must be at position 2 (to satisfy clue 3).
* If Banana is at position 3, then Avocado must be at position 2 or 4 (to satisfy clue 3).

Considering the first option, if Banana is at position 1 and Avocado is at position 2, we can't place Potato to the right of Avocado because there's no space left. So, this combination doesn't work.

Now considering the second option, if Banana is at position 3 and Avocado is at position 2, then Potato must be at position 4 (to satisfy clue 1).

The only remaining food item is Lemon, which can go to position 1.

So, the final solution is:

Lv4-1x4-3	"Let's break down the clues:

From clue 1, we know that the person watching zombie movies is either to the left or right of the person watching drama movies.

From clue 2, we know that the person watching drama movies is in an odd position, which means it can only be in positions 1 or 3.

Let's try to place the drama movie first. If it's in position 1, then the zombie movie must be in position 2 (since it's on the left). But this would mean that the mystery movie and martial-arts movie are not adjacent, which contradicts clue 3. Therefore, the drama movie cannot be in position 1.

So, the drama movie must be in position 3. Then, the zombie movie can be either in position 2 or 4. Let's try to place the zombie movie in position 2. This would mean that the mystery movie is between the zombie movie and the martial-arts movie, which would put the martial-arts movie in position 1. But this contradicts clue 3 again.

Therefore, the zombie movie must be in position 4. Then, the mystery movie can only be in position 2 (since it's between the zombie movie and the martial-arts movie). Finally, the martial-arts movie is left to be in position 1.

Here is the final solution:

From clue 1, we know that handball is in an even position. Since there are only two even positions (2 and 4), let's place handball in one of them for now.

| Sport   |            | Handball |         |          |

From clue 2, we know that sailing is to the right of handball. If handball were in position 4, there would be no space for sailing to its right, so handball must be in position 2.


|         |     1      |    2     |    3    |    4     |

Lv4-1x4-6	"Based on the given clues:

1. The Chinese is on the far right.
2. The Chinese is on the left or right of the Thai.
3. The Colombian is in an odd position.

Let's analyze:

From clue 1, we know the Chinese is at position 4.

|               |     1     |     2     |  3   |    Chinese|
| Nationality   |           |           |      |         |

From clue 2, since the Chinese is on the far right, the Thai must be to its left. Therefore:

|               |     1     |     2     |  Thai|    Chinese|
| Nationality   |           |           |      |         |

Now, from clue 3, we know the Colombian is in an odd position. The only remaining odd positions are 1 and 3. However, since the Thai already occupies position 3, the Colombian must be at position 1.

We still have one more nationality left: Brazilian. It can only fit at position 2.

Therefore, the final solution table is:


|               |     Colombian    |   Brazilian   |  Thai|    Chinese|

Lv4-1x4-7	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The analyst is on the left or right of the writer.
This means that the analyst and writer must be in adjacent positions.

2. The writer is in an odd position.
This means that the writer can only be in positions 1 or 3.

3. The firefighter is between the analyst and the dressmaker.
This means that the order of these three jobs must be: analyst, firefighter, dressmaker (or vice versa).

Considering all the clues, let's try to construct a solution:

If the writer is in position 1, then the analyst must be in position 2. But this would mean that the firefighter and dressmaker cannot be in adjacent positions with the analyst, which contradicts clue 3.

Therefore, the writer must be in position 3. The analyst can be either to the left or right of the writer, so let's try both options:

Option 1: Analyst in position 2
Writer in position 3
But then the firefighter and dressmaker cannot be in adjacent positions with the analyst.

Option 2: Analyst in position 4
This works! The firefighter can be in position 2, and the dressmaker can be in position 1.

So, the final solution is:

Lv4-1x4-8	"Based on the given clues:


1. The entrepreneur is in an even position, which means they can be either in position 2 or 4.
2. The freelancer is to the right of the entrepreneur.
3. The chef is to the right of the freelancer.


Given these constraints, we can deduce that:


- If the entrepreneur were in position 4 (the last even position), there wouldn't be enough space for both the freelancer and the chef to be to their right as required by clues 2 and 3.
- Therefore, the entrepreneur must be in position 2. This allows the freelancer to be in position 3 (to the right of the entrepreneur) and the chef in position 4 (to the right of the freelancer).
- The fisherman then takes the only remaining spot, which is position 1.


Therefore, the solution table looks like this:

From clue 1, we know that the fan of rock is either to the left or right of the fan of disco.


From clue 2, we know that the fan of d&b is between the fan of disco and the fan of folk.


From clue 3, we know that the fan of d&b is in an odd position, which means it can only be in positions 1 or 3.


Let's start by placing the fan of d&b. Since it's in an odd position, let's place it in position 1 for now:


|               |  1   |   2   |  3  |  4   |
| Music-Genre   | d&b  |       |     |      |

Now, from clue 2, we know that the fan of disco and folk must be on either side of the fan of d&b. Let's place them:


|               |  1   |   2   |  3  |  4   |
| Music-Genre   | d&b  | disco | folk |      |

Finally, from clue 1, we know that the fan of rock must be to the left or right of the fan of disco. Since there's no space to the left of disco, let's place rock to the right:


|               |  1   |   2   |  3  |  4   |
| Music-Genre   | d&b  | disco | folk | rock |

This solution satisfies all three clues.

From clue 3, we know that the person with the hobby of baking is in an even position. This means they can be in either position 2 or 4.

From clue 2, we know that the person with the hobby of photography is between the person who's hobby is baking and the person who's hobby is traveling. Since baking can be in position 2 or 4, let's consider both possibilities:


Case 1: Baking in position 2
Photography would be in position 3 (between baking and an unknown position for traveling)


|         |   1    |     2     |      3      |   4    |
| Hobby   |        |  Baking  | Photography |        |

Traveling can't be in position 1, as it would not satisfy clue 1 (sudoku being on the left or right of traveling). So, traveling must be in position 4.


|         |   1    |     2     |      3      |   4    |
| Hobby   |        |  Baking  | Photography | Travel |

| Hobby   | Sudoku |  Baking  | Photography | Travel |

Case 2: Baking in position 4
Photography would be in position either 1 or 3 (between baking and an unknown position for traveling)


If photography is in position 1, it contradicts clue 2, as photography should be between baking and traveling. So, photography must be in position 3.


|         |   1    |     2     |      3      |   4    |
| Hobby   |        |           | Photography | Baking |

Traveling can't be in position 2, as it would not satisfy clue 1 (sudoku being on the left or right of traveling). So, traveling must be in position 1.


|         |   1    |     2     |      3      |   4    |
| Hobby   | Travel |           | Photography | Baking |

Now, sudoku can only fit in position 2 to satisfy clue 1.
