Lv4-3x2-1	"Let's analyze the clues:


Clue 1: The person who's sport is skiing is on the right of the person driving the roller.


This means that the roller driver is in column 1, and the skier is in column 2.


Clue 2: The mexican is in an odd position


Since there are only two rows, this means the Mexican is in column 1 (an odd-numbered position).


Now, let's fill in the table:


|               |     1      |     2     |
| Nationality   | Mexican    | Colombian |
| Sport         |            | Skiing     |
| Transport     | Roller     |           |


The only sport left for column 1 is Water-Polo.


|               |     1      |     2     |
| Nationality   | Mexican    | Colombian |
| Sport         | Water-Polo | Skiing     |
| Transport     | Roller     | Taxi       |

This satisfies all the conditions.

Lv4-3x2-2	"Based on the clues:


|               |    1    |     2     |
| Beverage      | Sprite  | Mirinda   |
| Nationality   | Turkish | Canadian  |
| Transport     | Train   | Motorbike |

 
Clue 1: The person driving the train is on the left of the person drinking mirinda.

This means that the person drinking sprite must be driving the train, and they are in position 1.


Clue 2: The canadian is in an even position.

This means that the Canadian is in position 2. Since the Turkish person is already in position 1 (driving the train), this clue also implies that the person drinking mirinda is Canadian.


The final solution table:


#############
|               |    1    |     2     |

Lv4-3x2-3	"Based on the clues provided:


|               |      1       |    2     |
| Hobby         | collecting   | writing  |
| Movie-Genre   | martial-arts| fantasy  |
| Sport         | ice-hockey   | swimming |

Explanation of steps:

From clue 1, we know that the person whose hobby is writing must be in an even position, which means they are in column 2.

Clue 2 states that the person watching fantasy movies is to the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since column 2 is to the right of column 1, this implies that:

- The person watching fantasy movies must be in column 2.
- The person whose sport is ice-hockey must be in column 1.

Now we have:


|               |      1       |    2     |
| Hobby         |              | writing  |
| Movie-Genre   |              | fantasy  |
| Sport         | ice-hockey   |          |

The remaining information can now be filled out by process of elimination:

- The hobby ""collecting"" must go to column 1, since it's the only one left for that position.
- The movie-genre ""martial-arts"" goes to column 1 because fantasy is already assigned in column 2.
- Finally, the sport ""swimming"" fills out the remaining sport category.

Thus:

Lv4-3x2-4	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 2, we know that the person eating pomegranate is in an odd position, which means it must be in position 1.

Now, let's look at clue 1: ""the person driving the ship is on the right of the person watching superhero movies"". This implies that the person watching superhero movies is in position 1 and the person driving the ship is in position 2.

Since we already know that pomegranate is in an odd position (position 1), we can fill in the table as follows:

#############
|               |      1      |     2     |
| Food          | Pomegranate | Raspberry |
| Movie-Genre   | Superhero   | Fantasy    |
| Transport     |             | Ship       |

Now, let's look at the remaining options. Since we already know that ship is in position 2, train must be in position 1.

Here's the completed table:

Lv4-3x2-5	"Let's analyze the clues:

Clue 1: The person eating raspberry is to the right of the person who likes rugby.

This means that the person who likes rugby must be on the left (position 1), and the person who eats raspberry must be on the right (position 2).

|             |     1     |     2      |

| Transport   |           |            |

Clue 2: The person driving the quad-bike is in an odd position.

This means that the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 1, since it's an odd number.

|             |     1     |     2      |
| Food        |           |            |
| Sport       | Rugby    |            |
| Transport   | Quad-bike|            |

Now, let's think about the remaining options:

* The person who likes cricket must be on the right (position 2), since rugby is already taken by position 1.
* The person eating lime must be in a different column from raspberry, so they must be in position 1.

Here's the final solution:

Lv4-3x2-6	"Let's analyze the puzzle:


From clue 1, we know that the fan of metal is on the right of the person who's hobby is fishing.


Since there are only two people, this means that the person with the hobby of fishing must be in position 1, and the fan of metal must be in position 2.


Now, from clue 2, we know that the person who's sport is basketball is in an odd position. Since position 1 is the only odd position available, this means that the person in position 1 (whose hobby is fishing) also prefers basketball as a sport.


We can now start filling in the table:


|               |     1      |     2      |
| Hobby         | Fishing    |            |
| Music-Genre   |            | Metal       |
| Sport         | Basketball |            |


From the remaining options, we can deduce that the person in position 2 (whose favorite music genre is metal) must have singing as a hobby and water-polo as a sport.


Here's the completed table:

Lv4-3x2-7	"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the accountant.
This means that the person with skiing as their sport must be in column 1, and the accountant must be in column 2.

|         |   1    |     2      |
| Food    |        |            |
| Job     | Skiing | Accountant |
| Sport   |        |            |

2. The person who's sport is sailing is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skiing.
Since the person with skiing as their sport is in column 1, the person with sailing as their sport must be either in column 1 (which is not possible since it's already occupied) or in column 3, which doesn't exist. However, considering the table structure, the only possibility left is that the person with sailing as their sport is on the right of the person who's sport is skiing, but in this case, ""right"" means column 2, not an adjacent new column.

|         |   1    |     2      |
| Food    |        |            |
| Job     | Skiing | Accountant |
| Sport   | Sailing |            |

However, the sport column now contradicts our first arrangement. So let's correct this:

|         |   1    |     2      |
| Food    |        |            |
| Job     | Skiing | Accountant |
| Sport   |        | Sailing    |

3. The person eating pepper is in an even position.
Since column 2 is the only even-positioned column, the person eating pepper must be in column 2.

|         |   1    |     2      |
| Food    | Radish | Pepper    |
| Job     | Skiing | Accountant|
| Sport   |        | Sailing    |

Now let's fill in the remaining blanks:

The only job left is ""dancer"", which must be in column 1.
The only sport left is ""skiing"", which must be in column 1, since it can't be on the right of itself.

|         |   1    |     2      |
| Food    | Radish | Pepper    |

Lv4-3x2-8	"Let's analyze the clues:

Clue 1: The person driving the helicopter is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing.
This means that the person with surfing as their sport must be in column 1, and the person with the helicopter as their transport must be in column 2.

Clue 2: The person eating pumpkin is in an odd position.
Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), this means that the person eating pumpkin must be in position 1.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

| Hobby         | woodworking | baking    |
| Job           | bartender   | scientist |
| Music-Genre   | r&b         | classical |

Let's break down the reasoning:

From clue 1, we know the scientist is on the right of the fan of r&b. This means the person who likes r&b must be in position 1.

From clue 2, we know the person who bakes is in an even position (i.e., position 2).

Now, let's fill in the table:

* The fan of r&b is in position 1, so they can't be a scientist (from clue 1). Therefore, they must be a bartender.
* Since the baker is in position 2, and we already have a bartender in position 1, the person in position 2 must be a scientist.
* Finally, since the fan of r&b is already occupied by the bartender, the scientist in position 2 must prefer classical music.

Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:

Lv4-3x2-10	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 2, we know that the person drinking 7up is in an even position, which means they must be on the right side of the table (position 2).

From clue 1, we know that the person whose hobby is singing is to the right of the person eating kiwi. This means the person eating kiwi cannot be on the right side, so they must be on the left side (position 1). The person with the hobby of singing must be on the right side (position 2).

Now we can start filling in the table:

|            |      1      |    2    |
| Beverage   |             |         |
| Food       | kiwi        |         |
| Hobby      |             | singing |

Since the person drinking 7up is on the right side, and the hobby of singing is also on the right side, we can conclude that the person whose hobby is singing drinks 7up.

The only beverage left is almond-milk, which must be paired with the person eating kiwi. The only food left is kale, which must be paired with the person drinking 7up (who has the hobby of singing).

Finally, the only hobby left is filmmaking, which must be paired with the person eating kiwi.
