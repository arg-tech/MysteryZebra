Lv4-2x3-1	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a possible solution:


|        |      1      |      2      |     3     |
| Food   | pomegranate | cauliflower | pineapple |
| Job    | engineer    | firefighter | architect |

Let's go through the clues to see if this solution satisfies all of them:

1. The person eating cauliflower is in an even position: YES, cauliflower is at position 2.
2. The architect is on the left or right of the firefighter: YES, the architect is on the right of the firefighter (at position 3).
3. The architect is the person eating pineapple: YES, the architect is eating pineapple.
4. The person eating pomegranate is on the far left: YES, pomegranate is at position 1.

The fifth clue seems to be a tautology, stating that ""the engineer is the engineer,"" which doesn't provide any additional information.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv4-2x3-2	"After analyzing the puzzle, I have come up with a solution:


|             |    1    |     2      |      3      |
| Hobby       | Filmmaking|  Drawing   | Board-games|
| Transport   | Taxi      | Roller     | Boat        |


Here's my reasoning:

* From clue 1, we know the person who's hobby is board-games is on the far right (position 3).
* From clue 2, we know the person driving the roller is in an even position, which must be position 2.
* From clue 3, we know the person driving the taxi is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since the board-games enthusiast is already placed on the right, the filmmaking enthusiast must be in position 1 or 2. However, position 2 is taken by the roller driver, so the filmmaking enthusiast must be in position 1.
* From clue 4, we know... nothing new, as this clue seems to be redundant!
* Finally, we can place the drawing hobbyist in the remaining position (2), and the boat transport in the remaining position (3).

From clue 2, we know that the fan of electronic is on the left of the fan of dubstep.

| Hobby         |            |             |        |
| Music-Genre   | Electronic | Dubstep     |        |

Now, let's consider clue 1. The person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the fan of dubstep.


| Hobby         |            |             | Baking |
| Music-Genre   | Electronic | Dubstep     |        |

Next, we'll apply clue 3. The person who's hobby is photography is in an even position (i.e., either column 2). We can place it in column 2, as the other positions are already occupied by other hobbies.


| Hobby         |            | Photography | Baking |
| Music-Genre   | Electronic | Dubstep     |        |

The only music-genre left is salsa. Let's place it in column 3, where baking is.


| Hobby         |            | Photography | Baking |
| Music-Genre   | Electronic | Dubstep     | Salsa  |

Finally, we need to find a hobby for the person who likes electronic music (column 1). The only remaining hobby is sudoku.

Lv4-2x3-4	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


##################
|               |     1     |    2    |    3     |
| Movie-Genre   | Musical  | Superhero | Sports  |
| Sport         | Lacrosse | Biathlon  | Cricket |
##################


Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 2, we know the person watching musical movies is also into lacrosse. This means the person in column 1 must be watching musical movies and their sport is lacrosse.

Clue 3 tells us that the person watching sports movies is in an even position. Since there are only three columns, this means the person watching sports movies must be in either column 2 or not (since there's no column 4). However, clue 4 says the person watching sports movies is to the right of the person watching superhero movies. This implies that the person watching sports movies cannot be in column 1 (since there's no one to their left), and must therefore be in column 3.

Clue 1 states that the person watching sports movies is also into cricket. Therefore, the person in column 3 must have cricket as their sport.

Now we know the movie genres for columns 1 and 3, and the sports for columns 1 and 3. The only combination left for column 2 is superhero movies and biathlon.

So, there you have it!"
Lv4-2x3-5	"Let's analyze the clues:


From clue 1, we know the order of hobbies is: Camping, Gardening, ?? (can't be determined yet)
From clue 2, we know Chess is in an odd position, so it must be either 1 or 3.
From clue 3, we know Dutch is to the left of Canadian.


Combining these clues, we can start filling in the table:


|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |
| Hobby         | Chess     | Gardening | Camping  |
| Nationality   | Dutch     |           | Canadian |

Now, let's analyze the remaining options:


Since Chess is already filled in at position 1, and Gardening is between Camping and Canadian (clue 1), we can confirm the hobby order.


The only remaining nationality is Colombian, which must be paired with Gardening (since Dutch is with Chess and Canadian is with Camping).


The final solution table is:

|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |

From clue 3, we know that the person with the hobby ""collecting"" is in an odd position, so they must be either in position 1 or 3.


Clue 2 tells us that the person who's sport is tennis has a hobby of collecting. Since the person with hobby ""collecting"" is in an odd position, and clue 4 says that the person with hobby ""filmmaking"" is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis, it means that the person with sport ""tennis"" must be in position 1 or 3 as well.


If we put the person with sport ""tennis"" in position 1 and hobby ""collecting"", then the person with hobby ""filmmaking"" would have to be on their right, which means they would be in position 2 (because there is no space left on the right). This contradicts clue 4, so we can rule out this possibility.


So, we put the person with sport ""tennis"" and hobby ""collecting"" in position 3. Then, according to clue 1, the person with hobby ""baking"" must have a sport of lacrosse. Since there is no space left for them on the right (taken by the filmmaking person), they must be in position 1.


The only remaining combination is that the person with hobby ""filmmaking"" has a sport of cricket and must be in position 2, according to clue 4.


Here is the final solution table:

From clue 1, the person watching horror movies must be to the right of the documentary movie watcher, so they are in position 3.

From clue 2, the owner of the turtle is either to the left or right of the documentary movie watcher. Since position 2 is taken by the documentary movie watcher, the owner of the turtle must be in position 1.


|               |      1       |      2      |   3    |

| Pet           | Turtle     |             |        |


From clue 4, the owner of the dog is in an even position. Since position 2 is taken by the documentary movie watcher and position 1 has a pet already assigned to it, the owner of the dog must be in position 3 but this is not possible since horror movies are already assigned to this person.

| Pet           | Turtle     | Dog        |        |


This leaves only one option for the owner of the goat, which is position 1 but this is not possible since the turtle is already assigned to this person.

Lv4-2x3-8	"After analyzing the clues, I think I have a solution:


|        |   1    |  2   |     3     |
| Food   | Carrot | Artichoke | Kale      |
| Pet    | Rat    | Frog    | Snake     |

Here's my reasoning:

* From clue 2, the owner of the snake must be in an odd position, which means they can only be in position 1 or 3. But since the owner of the rat is on the left of the person eating kale (clue 3), and kale is not in position 1, the snake's owner cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the snake's owner must be in position 3.
* From clue 3, the owner of the rat is on the left of the person eating kale, which means they can only be in position 2 or 1. But since the frog's owner is between the rat and the artichoke (clue 1), the rat cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the rat's owner must be in position 1.
* From clue 1, the frog's owner is between the rat and the person eating artichoke. Since we already know the rat is in position 1, and the snake (not the artichoke eater) is in position 3, the frog must be in position 2.
* This leaves the carrot for position 1 (with the rat), artichoke for position 2 (between the rat and kale), and kale for position 3.

So, here's the final solution:


|        |   1    |  2   |     3     |
| Food   | Carrot | Artichoke | Kale      |

Lv4-2x3-9	"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who's sport is tennis is in an odd position, which means they can be in either position 1 or 3.
2. The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left of the fan of ambient.
3. The person who's sport is tennis is on the left of the fan of dubstep.
4. The person who's sport is tennis is on the left or right of the person who's sport is lacrosse.

From clue 2, we know that lacrosse can't be in position 1 (since ambient would have to be to its right). From clue 3, we know that tennis can't be in position 3 (since dubstep would have to be to its right).

Let's combine the information:

* Tennis is in an odd position (clue 1), so it must be in position 1.
* Lacrosse is on the left of ambient (clue 2), and since tennis is in position 1, lacrosse can't be in position 1. Therefore, lacrosse must be in position 2, and ambient must be in position 3.
* Dubstep must be to the right of tennis (clue 3), so dubstep must be in position 2 or 3. But since lacrosse is already in position 2, dubstep must be in a different row than lacrosse.

Here's the final solution:

| Sport         | tennis | climbing | lacrosse |

Lv4-2x3-10	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person eating corn is to the right of the person drinking cola.
This means the person drinking cola cannot be in position 3, since there would be no one to their right. So, the person drinking cola must be in either position 1 or 2.

2. The person eating pineapple is in an even position.
Since there are only three positions (1, 2, and 3), this means the person eating pineapple must be in either position 2.

3. The person eating pineapple is to the right of the person drinking 7up.
This means the person drinking 7up cannot be in position 3, since the person eating pineapple would have no one to their left. Also, since the person eating pineapple is in an even position (position 2), the person drinking 7up must be in position 1.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|            |   1    |     2     |   3    |
| Beverage   | 7up    | cola      |        |
| Food       |        | pineapple |        |

We know the person eating corn is to the right of the person drinking cola, so the person eating corn must be in position 3. The only remaining beverage is coffee, which must be in position 3 as well.
