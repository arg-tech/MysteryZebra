| Sport         |              tennis     | handball         | parkour        | skateboarding  | skiing       |

Explanation:

From clue 5, the fan of country is on the far left.

From clue 1 and 2, the fan of rock is next to the writer and software-developer. Given that the fan of country is on the far left, we can deduce that the writer is in position 2.

From clue 6, the person eating potato is the doctor, so the doctor must be in position 3 or 4 (since the social-worker is between the owner of the rat and the person who's sport is parkour). However, from clue 3, we know that the social-worker is between the owner of the rat and the person who's sport is parkour. Since there are only two positions left in the middle, the doctor must be in position 4.

From clue 11, the owner of the dog is on the left of the firefighter, so the firefighter must be in position 4 or 5. However, from clue 9, we know that the firefighter is between the person who's sport is parkour and the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since there are only two positions left in the middle, the firefighter must be in position 5.

From clue 22, the person eating corn is in an odd position, so the person eating corn must be in position 1 or 3 or 5. However, from clue 18, we know that the person who's sport is tennis is on the left of the person eating corn. Since the firefighter is already in position 5, and the social-worker is between the owner of the rat and the person who's sport is parkour, the person eating corn must be in position 3 or 5.

From clue 14, the person drinking tea is the owner of the frog, so the owner of the frog must be on the right of the fan of house. Given that the software-developer is already on the right of the firefighter (clue 23), we can deduce that the fan of house must be in position 3.

From clue 20, the person drinking mirinda is on the left of the person drinking tea, so the person drinking mirinda must be in position 2.

From clue 12, the person drinking juice is the owner of the cat. Given that the owner of the dog is already on the far left or far right (clue 21), we can deduce that the owner of the cat must be in position 2.

From clue 13, the fan of hip-hop is on the right of the firefighter. However, since the software-developer is already on the right of the firefighter, this creates a contradiction unless the fan of hip-hop and the software-developer are one and the same person. Therefore, the fan of hip-hop must be in position 5.

From clue 8, the owner of the frog is on the right of the fan of house, so the owner of the frog must be in position 4 or 5. However, since the software-developer is already in position 5, we can deduce that the owner of the frog must be in position 5.

From clue 16, the person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the owner of the snake, so the person who's sport is parkour must be in position 3 or 4. However, since the social-worker is between the owner of the rat and the person who's sport is parkour (clue 3), we can deduce that the person who's sport is parkour must be in position 3.

From clue 9, the firefighter is between the person who's sport is parkour and the person who's sport is skateboarding. Therefore, the person who's sport is parkour must be on the left of the firefighter.

From clue 17, the person drinking coffee is the fan of country, so the person drinking coffee must be in position 1.

The rest of the clues can be solved by simple elimination and logic.

| Sport         | jet-ski      | cycling      | rowing     | sailing    | basketball |
| Transport     | helicopter is not on the table, scooter and subway are. so I swapped it with taxi: | jet-ski   | taxi       | subway     | scooter    | helicopter|

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:

* From clue 19, we know that the person driving the jet-ski is Indian.
* Clue 20 tells us that this person is on the far left, so Indian and Jet-Ski go in position 1.
* From clue 14, magic-tricks is on the far left, which conflicts with the previous statement. However, looking at other clues (4,17), I realized that the ""magic-tricks"" hobby is also on the far left.
* Clue 18 tells us that the fan of reggae is driving a helicopter, but since jet-ski is already in position 1, we put helicopter in position 5.
* Now using clue 3 and 6, reggae is in the middle (position 3) and has soul to its right. Since metal is on the far left or far right (clue 17), it goes with card-games on the far right (position 2).
* Clue 9 tells us that traveling is in an even position (2 or 4), but since position 2 is taken by card-games, we put traveling in position 4.
* From clue 8, cycling is to the left of Chinese. Since cycling can't be on the far left (taken by magic-tricks) and there are already two people on the far right, we put cycling in position 2 doesn't work since it would conflict with other clues so it goes in position 1 is taken so I swapped to: 2.
* Now looking at clue 5, epic movies can be on either side of Malaysian. Since position 4 has traveling and is even, we put epic in position 4 as well which doesn't work since there is only space for one more person here, then it goes to 5
* We continue filling in the gaps using other clues.

Please note that this solution assumes that each person can have multiple hobbies, but for simplicity, I've only listed one hobby per person."

Lv4-6x5-7	"Here is the final solution table:


|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |       4       |     5      |

| Transport     | helicopter | snowmobile | taxi       | trike         | motorbike   |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 3, we know that the person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping. Combining this with clue 1, we can determine that the person who's sport is soccer is in position 3 or 4.
* Clue 17 tells us that the person drinking milk is on the far right, and from clue 15, we know that this person's sport is cricket. Therefore, position 5 has a sport of cricket and a beverage of milk.
* Clue 7 states that the person driving the motorbike is on the far right, which means position 5 also has a transport of motorbike.
* From clue 4, we can determine that the person drinking 7up is in either position 2 or 4. Since position 5 already has a beverage and sport assigned, it's more likely that the person drinking 7up is in position 4.
* Clue 19 states that the colombian is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile, which means position 3 has a nationality of colombian. From clue 22, we know that the fan of salsa (position 2) is also the person who's sport is basketball, so position 3 must have a sport of soccer.
* Clue 16 states that the malaysian is in an even position, and from clue 10, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the malaysian. Therefore, position 2 has a nationality of malaysian and a beverage of soy-milk.
* The rest of the solution falls into place using the remaining clues.

#############

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

1. Clue 3 implies that sailing is on the right side, so I started by placing sailing in column 5.
2. From clue 6, funk is associated with sailing, which further confirms sailing's position in column 5 and places funk next to it (column 4).
3. Using clue 13, funk is indeed on the far right, reinforcing its placement in column 4.
4. The freelancer watches drama movies according to clue 14, so I placed them together in column 2.
5. Clue 19 helps place mango next to freelancer (now chef), and thus we have tomato at an odd position (column 3).
6. Lime's placement was constrained by clues 8 and 5, which ultimately led to placing it on the far right or left; I chose the latter for now.
7. The fan of rock is in an even position, according to clue 22, so I placed them in column 2.
8. From clue 11 and 12, superhero movies are between rowing and kale, which further helps establish their positions (column 3).
9. Clue 23 indicates that animation movies are next to cat; since the ferret is on either side of frog according to clues 4 and 16, I placed them in columns 2 and 3.
10. Finally, clue 18 associates pop with security-guard, completing the table.
