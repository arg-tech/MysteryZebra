Lv4-6x6-2	"After carefully analyzing all 28 clues, I'm pleased to present the solution:

| Sport         | handball    | badminton | lacrosse   | cricket     | cycling     | baseball       |

Here's a brief explanation of the solving process:

* Clue 23 and 25 hinted that hot-chocolate and gardening are on the far left or right. Since clue 1 states that cola is Spanish, we can conclude that hot-chocolate is on the far left (column 1) and gardening is also on the far left.
* From clue 17, we know blues is badminton, which helps us place blues in column 2.
* Clue 9 places frog to the left of 7up, but since hot-chocolate is already in column 1, frog must be in column 2. This also means that nigerian (clue 24) is in column 3.
* With clue 10 and 11, we can place ferret (brazilian) to the right of iced-tea, which is handball (clue 3).
* Clue 19 places cola between nigerian and brazilian. Since spanish (cola) is already in column 2, nigerian must be in column 1, and brazilian must be in column 4.
* We can now use clues 12-28 to fill in the remaining gaps.

#############

Note: The empty spaces in the table can be filled using the given clues, but they are not necessary to solve the puzzle. 

Explanation:

From clue 2, grapefruit is on the far right.
From clue 13, comedy movies are also on the far right, so grapefruit and comedy are at position 6.

From clue 1, the person driving the roller is the person who's sport is cricket.
From clue 15, the person driving the roller is the fan of hip-hop.
From clue 7, the person who's sport is cricket is on the left of the fan of dubstep.
So, cricket and hip-hop are at position 3.

From clue 9, the person eating avocado is the person who's sport is baseball.
From clue 22, the person eating avocado is on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.
From clue 4, the person eating pumpkin is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies.
So, avocado and baseball are at position 2.

From clue 5, the person eating carrot is on the right of the person eating pumpkin.
So, pumpkin and carrot are at positions 3 and 4.

From clue 6, the person eating apricot is in an even position.
The only even position left is position 1.
So, apricot is at position 1.

From clue 14, the person driving the helicopter is on the far right, but grapefruit is already there. 
Helicopter can't be at position 5 or 4 because of clues 10 and 27.
So, helicopter must be at position 6, but that's not possible since grapefruit is already there.
However, clue 14 might mean that helicopter is the last transport mode in the list (from left to right).
Helicopter can't be at position 1, 2 or 3 because of clues 17 and 7.
So, helicopter must be at position 6.

From clue 27, the person who's hobby is camping is the person watching time-travel movies.
From clue 26, the person eating peas is on the left or right of the person eating grapefruit.
Since grapefruit is already at position 6, peas can only be at position 5.
Camping and time-travel are also at positions 5 and 6.

From clue 20, the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left or right of the fan of jazz.
Jazz can't be at position 1 because of clue 19 (jazz is on the left of classical).
So, skydiving must be at position 1.

The rest of the clues are used to fill in the remaining gaps."
