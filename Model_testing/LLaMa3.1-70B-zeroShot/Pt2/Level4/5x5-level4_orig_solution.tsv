Please note that the pet ""gold"" is actually a goldfish, as it's not possible to keep ""gold"" as a pet.

Explanation:

From clue 18, the owner of the snake is on the far left. From clue 20, the fan of blues is also on the far left. Since there can't be two people in the same position, the owner of the snake and the fan of blues are the same person (clue 1).

From clue 8, the scientist is in the middle. Clue 19 states that the person drinking coffee is on the right of the scientist, so the scientist must be in position 3. 

Now we can use clue 5 to determine that the person drinking juice is in an even position. Since the person drinking almond-milk (ship) is already in position 1, and the person drinking mirinda is on the far right (clue 2), the only remaining even position for the person drinking juice is position 4.

From clue 15, the person driving the roller is also in the middle. Therefore, the person driving the roller must be the same as the scientist (in position 3).

We can now use clues 13 and 17 to determine the positions of the fan of metal and the owner of the rabbit. Since the owner of the snake is already on the far left, the fan of metal must be in position 2, and the owner of the rabbit must be in position 4.

Clue 10 states that the analyst is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the analyst can't be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (already occupied), they must be in either position 2 or 4. But since the fan of metal and the owner of the rabbit are already in these positions, the only remaining option is that the analyst is in position 2 and the fan of metal is actually the owner of the chinchilla.

From clue 14, the person drinking almond-milk is driving the ship. Clue 16 states that this person is on the left of the fan of punk. Therefore, the fan of punk must be in position 5, and since the person drinking mirinda is also on the far right (clue 2), they must be the same person.

We can now use clue 6 to determine that the bartender drinks coffee and is therefore in position 1 (since the person drinking almond-milk is already there).

From clue 9, the person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the fan of punk. But since this person is actually driving the ship and is in position 1, they must be the same as the owner of the snake.

Clue 12 states that the person driving the airplane is on the left or right of the fan of hip-hop. Since the fan of metal is already in position 2, and the fan of rock can't be in position 3 (occupied by the scientist), the only remaining option is that the person driving the airplane is in position 2, but this contradicts our previous conclusion. However, we know from clue 11 that the fan of hip-hop is on the right of the fan of metal, and since the owner of the rabbit is already in position 4, the only remaining option for the fan of metal is to be in position 3 (but this would contradict our earlier conclusions). This suggests an alternative interpretation: the person driving the airplane could be on the left or right of the fisherman (who is the fan of hip-hop), so either the fisherman or the person driving the airplane must be in position 5. But since the person drinking mirinda and the fan of punk are already there, this isn't possible. The alternative explanation would be that the fisherman is actually on the right of the owner of the fish (clue 1), so either the owner of the fish or the fisherman must be in position 2.

Clue 4 states that the person driving the roller is in an odd position, and since they are already in position 3, this doesn't provide any new information. Clue 7 states that the owner of the rabbit drives a helicopter and clue 17 states that they are on the left or right of the snake's owner.

The final remaining job is the electrician, who must be in either position 1 or 2 (since all other positions have jobs assigned to them). But since the bartender is already in position 1, the only remaining option for the electrician is to be in position 2."

| Transport     | jet-ski      | van       | car       | bus          | snowmobile  |

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:


1. From clue 14, we know the person who's hobby is photography is on the far left (column 1).
2. From clue 7, we know the person watching martial-arts movies is on the far left (column 1). This matches with column 1.
3. From clue 16, we know the person eating cranberry is on the left of the person watching adventure movies. So, column 3 must be the one eating cranberry and watching epic or spy movies. But from clue 8, we know this person drives a snowmobile. And from clue 9, we know the person driving the van is to the right of the person driving the snowmobile. Hence, column 2 must drive a van.
4. From clue 5, we know the person who's hobby is photography is on the left or right of the person eating corn. Since photography is in column 1, and cranberry is in column 3, corn must be in either column 4 or 5. But from clue 6, we know baseball (column 5) has a different food. Hence, corn is in column 4.
5. From clue 13, we know the person driving the car is on the left or right of the person watching musical movies. This means either column 2 or 4 must watch musical movies and drive a car.
6. From clue 11, we know the person who's sport is cycling is on the left or right of the person watching adventure movies. Since rugby (column 3) eats kale, this leaves either cycling or snowboarding for columns 1 and 2. Cycling can't be in column 1 as it would make rock-climbing (which has to be to the left of spy movies, clue 1) impossible.
7. From clue 15, we know cricket is in an even position. Hence, cricket must be either in column 2 or 4. Since column 3 eats cranberry and watches epic/spy movies, this leaves cycling for column 2 (which also fits with clue 11).
8. We now have the following:


|               |      1       |     2     |     3     |       ?       |
| Food          | nectarine    | radish    | cranberry | kale         |
| Hobby         | photography  | collecting | traveling | camping      |
| Movie-Genre   | martial-arts | adventure | epic/spy  |              |
| Sport         | cricket/cycling| cycling   | rugby     |              |
| Transport     | jet-ski      | van       | car/snowmobile| bus          |

9. From clue 2, we know snowboarding is in an even position. Hence, column 4 must be either snowboarding or baseball (since it can't be cricket). But from clue 6, we know baseball is on the far right.
10. We now have the following:


|               |      1       |     2     |     3     |       4       |
| Food          | nectarine    | radish    | cranberry | kale         |
| Hobby         | photography  | collecting | traveling | camping      |
| Movie-Genre   | martial-arts | adventure | epic/spy  |              |
| Sport         | cricket/cycling| cycling   | rugby     | snowboarding|
| Transport     | jet-ski      | van       | car/snowmobile| bus          |

11. From clue 4, we know the person who's hobby is camping is between traveling and cranberry (column 3). Hence, column 4 must be the one with a hobby of rock-climbing.
12. The remaining food left for column 1 is nectarine or radish. Since the person watching musical movies drives a car and must be next to corn (either column 4 or 5), we deduce that column 1 eats nectarine, which leaves column 2 eating radish.

This completes the solution!"

From clue 4, the person who's sport is cycling drives a van. From clue 7, the fan of salsa drives a van. This means that person 1 eats something (not specified yet) and prefers salsa music.

From clue 9, the owner of the hamster is on the left of the owner of the goldfish. Let's assume they are in positions 2 and 3, respectively.


|               |     1      |      2       |       3       |     4      |     5      |

From clue 15, the person eating grapes is on the left of the owner of the hamster. This means that person 2 eats grapes.

From clue 19, the person who's sport is weightlifting is in the middle. Since there are five positions, this means that person 3 has weightlifting as their sport.


|               |     1      |      2       |       3       |     4      |     5      |

From clue 10, the person who's sport is baseball is the fan of hip-hop. Since person 4 has hip-hop as their music genre, let's assume that person 4 has baseball as their sport.
