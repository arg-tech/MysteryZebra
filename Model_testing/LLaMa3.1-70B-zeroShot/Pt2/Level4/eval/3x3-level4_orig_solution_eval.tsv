Lv4-3x3-1	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |     1     |       2       |    3     |
| Music-Genre   |   Pop     |   Classical  |  House   |
| Nationality   |   Thai    |   Indian     |  Turkish |
| Sport         | Badminton| Skateboarding| Climbing|
#############


Here's how the solution was derived:

From clue 5, we know that the fan of pop is on the far left, so column 1 must be Pop.

From clue 2, we know that the Thai is to the left of the Indian. Since the Thai can't be in column 3 (because then the Indian would have to be outside the table!), and also can't be on the right (because then the Indian wouldn't be to the right), the Thai must be in column 1, and the Indian must be in column 2.

From clue 4, we know that the Thai is in an even position. But since the Thai is already in column 1 (an odd position), this means that there's another Thai person in column 3 (which can't happen) or the puzzle statement has a mistake and ""even"" should be replaced by ""odd"". However, let's move on.

From clue 1, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is in an even position. This means that Skateboarding must be in either column 2 (an even position). 

From clue 3, we know that the fan of classical is to the right of the person who's sport is badminton. Since Badminton can't be on the far right (because then there wouldn't be anyone for Classical to be to the right of!), and also can't be in column 2 (because then Classical would have to be outside the table or in column 1, but Skateboarding needs to be in column 2), we deduce that Badminton is in column 1.

Putting all this together, House must be in column 3 (since it's the only one left), and Climbing must also be in column 3. But wait! We already have a sport assigned to column 3, which is Skateboarding. This means our earlier assumption that there was a mistake in the puzzle statement and ""even"" should be replaced by ""odd"" in clue 4 is incorrect, so we should re-check everything.

Indeed, if we go back and assume that the Thai person is actually on an even column (column 2), then we have:


#############
|               |     1     |       2       |    3     |
| Music-Genre   |   Pop     |   Classical  |  House   |
| Nationality   |   Indian  |   Thai       |  Turkish |
| Sport         | Badminton| Skateboarding| Climbing|
#############


which seems correct!

However, we can still try to see if it's possible for the other columns:


#############
|               |     1     |       2       |    3     |
| Music-Genre   |   Pop     |   Classical  |  House   |
| Nationality   | Turkish   | Thai         | Indian  |
| Sport         | Climbing  | Skateboarding| Badminton|

Lv4-3x3-2	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 1, we know the teacher eats nectarine.

From clue 3, we know the teacher (nectarine) is on the left of the person eating cabbage.

From clue 5, we know the teacher is in an even position, which means the teacher must be in position 2.

Now, let's fill in what we have so far:

|         |      1      |     2      |    3     |
| Food    |             | Nectarine | Cabbage   |
| Hobby   |             |            |          |
| Job     |             | Teacher   |          |

From clue 6, we know the teacher is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games. Since the teacher is in position 2, the person with the hobby of video-games must be in position 1.

From clue 4, we know the musician is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting. This means the person with the hobby of collecting cannot be in position 3 (because there is no one to the right of them). Therefore, the person with the hobby of collecting must be in either position 1 or 2. But we already know that the person with the hobby of video-games is in position 1, so the person with the hobby of collecting must be in position 2... wait, no! We can't have two people with different hobbies in the same position. This means our initial assumption was wrong, and the musician cannot be on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting. The only other possibility is that the musician is in position 3, and the person who's hobby is collecting is in position 2.

Now we have:

|         |      1      |     2      |    3     |
| Food    |             | Nectarine | Cabbage   |
| Hobby   | Video-games | Collecting |          |
| Job     |             | Teacher   | Musician |

From clue 2, we know the person who's hobby is video-games is on the left or right of the teacher. We already know they are on the left.

The only job left is dancer, which must be in position 1.

The only food left is avocado, which must be in position 1.

Here is the final solution:

#############
|         |      1      |     2      |    3     |
| Food    | Avocado    | Nectarine | Cabbage   |
| Hobby   | Video-games| Collecting |          |
| Job     | Dancer     | Teacher   | Musician |
#############

And the person in position 3 must have chess as their hobby.

Final solution:

#############
|         |      1      |     2      |    3     |

Lv4-3x3-3	"After analyzing the clues, I'll try to fill in the table. Here's my attempt:


|               |       1       |    2     |   3    |
| Food          |               |          |        |

| Sport         |               |          |        |

From clue 4, we know the person eating plum is on the right of the person eating apple. From clue 2, we know the person eating apple prefers weightlifting.

So, let's start with:

|               |       1       |    2     |   3    |
| Food          | Apple        |          | Plum  |
| Music-Genre   |               |          |        |
| Sport         | Weightlifting|          |        |

From clue 5, we know the person eating plum is on the left or right of the fan of reggae. Since plum is already in position 3, reggae must be in position 2.

Now we have:

|               |       1       |    2     |   3    |
| Food          | Apple        | Kiwi    | Plum  |
| Music-Genre   |              | Reggae |        |
| Sport         | Weightlifting|          |        |

From clue 1, we know the person who's sport is lacrosse is in an even position. Since position 2 is already occupied by reggae, lacrosse must be in position 2.

Wait, that can't be right! Position 2 already has a music-genre assigned to it. So, lacrosse must be in position 3 (no, just kidding!) or... it must be in position 2 as the sport, but then we need to swap the person who likes reggae with someone else.

Let's try again:

|               |       1       |    2     |   3    |
| Food          | Apple        | Kiwi    | Plum  |
| Music-Genre   |              | Funk    | Reggae|
| Sport         | Weightlifting| Lacrosse|        |

Now we have funk in position 2, and reggae is on the right of it, as required by clue 3.

Finally, from clue 1, we know lacrosse is in an even position. And indeed, it's in position 2!

The final solution table is:


#############
|               |       1       |    2     |   3    |

Lv4-3x3-4	"Based on the given clues, here's the step-by-step solution:


From clue 4, we know that the person drinking coffee is on the far left.


|            |   1    |    2     |       3       |
| Beverage   | Coffee |          |               |
| Job        |        |          |               |
| Pet        |        |          |               |

From clue 5, we know that the writer is either on the far left or far right. But since coffee is already on the far left (clue 4), the writer must be on the far right.


|            |   1    |    2     |       3       |
| Beverage   | Coffee |          |               |
| Job        |        |          | Writer        |
| Pet        |        |          |               |

From clue 6, we know that the teacher is on the right of the writer. Since the writer is already on the far right (deduced from clue 5), this means there must be an empty slot to the left of the writer for the teacher to occupy.


|            |   1    |    2     |       3       |
| Beverage   | Coffee |          |               |

| Pet        |        |          |               |

From clue 2, we know that the owner of the goldfish is on the right of the writer. But since there's no slot to the right of the writer (it's already at the end), this means that the writer must be in position 3.


|            |   1    |    2     |       3       |
| Beverage   | Coffee |          |               |

| Pet        |        | Goldfish |               |

From clue 1, we know that the person drinking mirinda is on the left of the owner of the snake. Since there's no slot to the right of position 2 (it would require an extra row), this means that the owner of the snake must be in position 3.


|            |   1    |    2     |       3       |
| Beverage   | Coffee |          | Mirinda      |
| Job        |        | Teacher  | Writer        |
| Pet        |        | Goldfish | Snake         |

Now, the only remaining job is social-worker. Since it's an odd position (clue 3), it must be in either position 1 or 3.


But since writer and teacher are already in positions 2 and 3, social-worker must be in position 1.


|            |   1    |    2     |       3       |
| Beverage   | Coffee |          | Mirinda      |
| Job        | SW     | Teacher  | Writer        |
| Pet        |        | Goldfish | Snake         |

The only remaining beverage is hot-chocolate, which must be in position 2.

Lv4-3x3-5	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |      1      |    2     |    3    |
| Movie-Genre   | Time-travel | Romance  | Satire  |
| Nationality   | Chinese     | American | Australian|
| Pet           | Mouse       | Chinchilla| Bird     |
#############


Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 5, we know that the person watching time-travel movies is on the far left. So, we can start by placing Time-travel in position 1.

Clue 3 tells us that the owner of the bird is on the right of the person watching romance movies. Since the owner of the bird is in an odd position (clue 4), they must be in position 3. This means Romance is in position 2.

Now, let's place the nationalities. Clue 1 states that the American is on the left or right of the owner of the bird. Since the owner of the bird is in position 3, the American must be in either position 1 or 2. But if they were in position 1, there would be no one to the left of the mouse (clue 2). So, the American must be in position 2.

Clue 6 states that the person watching satire movies is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies. Since Romance is in position 2 and Time-travel is already occupied by the Chinese nationality in position 1, Satire must be in position 3 (but we know it's actually in position 3 because of clue 4). However, there is another possibility: Satire could be in position 1 and Time-travel could be in position 2. But then the person watching time-travel movies wouldn't be on the far left as required by clue 5.

The only remaining nationality is Australian, which must go to position 3 (since American is already in position 2).

Finally, we can place the pets according to their respective owners' positions.

From clue 2, we know that the person who's hobby is board-games drinks milk.

From clue 3, we know that the person drinking cola is to the left of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since there are only three positions, this means that the person drinking cola must be in position 1 or 2.


From clue 4, we know that the person driving the car is in an even position, which means they must be in position 2.


Now, let's combine these clues:


|             |    1    |   2   |      3      |
| Beverage    | cola    | milk  | sprite     |
| Hobby       |         | board-games |          |
| Transport   | quad-bike| car   | boat        |

From clue 1, we know that the person drinking cola is between the person driving the quad-bike and the person who's hobby is singing. Since the person drinking cola is in position 1 or 2, this means that the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 1 and the person who's hobby is singing must be in position 3.


Now we can fill in the remaining information:

| Movie-Genre   | Western | Sports        | Family  |
| Pet           | Frog    | Rat           | Goldfish|
| Sport         | Tennis  | Skateboarding | Golf     |

Let me explain how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 3, we know that skateboarding is in an even position, which means it must be in position 2.

Clue 1 tells us that sports movies are between frog and western. Since frog can't be on the right (because of clue 2), it must be on the left. This places western in position 3 and sports movies in position 2 doesn't work, so sports movies must be in position 1 is also not possible because of clue 4. So sports movies are in position 2, frog is in position 1, and western is in position 3.

Clue 4 tells us that sports movies are on the right of tennis, which means tennis is in position 1 or 3 doesn't work so it must be in position 1 but we already know frog is there. It could also mean that tennis is not sport of person who prefers western. If tennis is for person with western then from clue 4 sports movie can only be in pos2 and if golf and skateboarding were at either side then rat can't be at right so it's a contradiction, this means that tennis must be in position 1.



Since skateboarding is in an even position (position 2), its sport person cannot have a frog as pet. Now we know the positions of western and sports movies. From clue 2, the owner of the rat must be on the right of skateboarding, which puts the rat's owner in position 3.

Since the person eating potato is in position 3, the person who's sport is lacrosse must be in position 1 or 2. But the person eating corn is already in position 1, so the person who's sport is lacrosse must be the person eating pineapple (in position 2). Also, since the pilot can't be on the right of the person eating potato, the pilot must be in position 1.

|               |     1      |    2    |       3       |
| Hobby         | collecting | rock-climbing | camping |
| Nationality   | polish     | thai        | pakistani|
| Pet           | rabbit     | goat        | rat      |

Here's how I arrived at the solution:


From clue 4, we know that the Pakistani is on the right of the Polish. Since the Pakistani is in an odd position (clue 2), it must be in position 3.


Clue 1 tells us that the person who's hobby is camping is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting. This means that the camper cannot be in position 1, so they must be in position 3. However, we already know that the Pakistani is in position 3, and since there's no information about a nationality having a specific hobby, this creates a conflict.


Let's revisit clue 5: ""the person who's hobby is camping is between the owner of the goat and the person who's hobby is collecting"". This means that the camper must be in position 2 or 3. If they were in position 1, they would not be between the collector and the goat owner.


Now, let's re-evaluate clue 4: ""the pakistani is on the right of the polish"". Since the Polish cannot be in position 3 (because the Pakistani is), it must be in either position 1 or 2. If it were in position 1, then the Pakistani would have to be in position 2, but we already established that the camper must be in position 2 or 3.


Therefore, I conclude that:


* The Polish person is in position 1.
* The Pakistani person is in position 3 (because they are on the right of the Polish).
* The person who's hobby is camping is in position 3 (to satisfy clue 5), but this conflicts with our previous conclusion. Therefore, I'll reassign the camper to position 2, which satisfies all other clues.
* Clue 3 states that the polish is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit. Since we know the Polish person is in position 1, and the Pakistani (who cannot own the rabbit) is in position 3, the rabbit must be owned by either the person in position 2 or none at all. I'll assign it to the person in position 1.
* The only remaining pet is the goat, which we know from clue 5 is between the collector and the camper. Therefore, it belongs to the person in position 2.
* Finally, the rat must belong to the Pakistani in position 3.


Here is the final solution:

Lv4-3x3-10	"Let's start by filling in the information we know for sure:


|               |      1       |      2      |    3    |
| Job           |              |             | Nurse   |
| Movie-Genre   |              |             |         |
| Nationality   |              |             |         |

From clue 4, we know the chef is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the nurse is already in position 3, the chef must be in position 2.


|               |      1       |      Chef   | Nurse   |
| Movie-Genre   |              |             |         |
| Nationality   |              |             |         |

From clue 6, we know the person watching time-travel movies is in an even position. This means they must be in either position 2 or none (since there are only three positions). However, since the chef is already in position 2, the person watching time-travel movies must not be in position 2.

From clue 5, we know the Thai is on the left of the person watching time-travel movies. Since the person watching time-travel movies cannot be in position 2 (occupied by the chef), and they must be in an even position, it means they must be in position none or not exist... wait that does not make sense let me try again

If a person is on the left of another, that other can only be either 1 position to their right.

Given that clue 5 says thai is on the left and that time travel movies has to be on an even number we know this 
Thai cannot be in position 3 (nurse), so Thai must be in position 2
But wait chef was already there, and chef cannot share a spot. However given the other clues we also know that german or russian is one of them.

So let us put thai in spot #2, and look for chef.
We will need to read the next clue again since the chef has moved.


|               |      1       | Thai     | Nurse   |
| Movie-Genre   |              |             |         |
| Nationality   |              |             |         |

From clue 3 we know german is on the left or right of thai. Since the nurse is already in position 3, the german must be in position 1.


|               | German      | Thai     | Nurse   |
| Movie-Genre   |              |             |         |
| Nationality   |              |             |         |

From clue 4 we know that chef is on the right of the person watching martial arts movies. Since thai cannot share a spot and martial arts also cannot be in position #3 (nurse) 
we conclude chef is not next to martial arts, since chef has no other places left to go, it means he was already moved to the left.

Now we are going to have to read clue 2 again because martial arts movies was just moved
Since chef is now on spot #1

Martial Arts cannot be in position 1 (chef), so Martial Arts must be in either of the other two positions. Since thai is next to german and not the other way around, it means the person watching martial arts has to be thai.


|               | Chef       | Thai     | Nurse   |
| Movie-Genre   |              | Martial-Arts  |         |
| Nationality   | German      | Thai     | Russian |

Finally we just need to read clue 5 and clue 6 again
Clue 5 says thai is on the left of time travel movies so 
we conclude that person watching time-travel has to be russian.
And since clue 6 says it has to be in an even number, this means russian has to be in position #2 which also works

It looks like we only have one more spot left for photographer
So our final solution is
