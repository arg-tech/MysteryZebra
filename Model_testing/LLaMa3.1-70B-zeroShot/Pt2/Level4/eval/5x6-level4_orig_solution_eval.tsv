| Nationality   | American   | Australian | Indonesian| Canadian  | Egyptian   | Malaysian    |

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 5, we know the dressmaker is on the far left (column 1).
* From clue 19, we know the person eating cherry is on the far left, which means the food in column 1 is Cherry.
* From clue 3, we know the Indonesian is on the left or right of the dressmaker. Since the dressmaker is already on the far left, the Indonesian must be in column 2 or 3.
* From clue 13, we know the Indonesian is between the person eating zucchini and the American. This means the person eating zucchini must be in column 1 or 2 (since the Indonesian can't be on the far right), but since cherry is already in column 1, the person eating zucchini must be in column 3.
* From clue 9, we know the person watching satire movies is the same as the person whose hobby is card-games. Since the person eating apricot is also the person whose hobby is card-games (clue 24), and the person eating apricot is on the left or right of the person eating cherry (clue 12), the person eating apricot must be in column 4.
* We can continue using these deductions to fill out the rest of the table, making sure to satisfy all the given clues.

Lv4-5x6-5	"After carefully analyzing the clues, I have arrived at a possible solution to the logic puzzle. Here is the completed table:


|               |     1      |    2     |     3      |     4      |      5      |       6       |

| Pet           | snake      | hamster  | rat        | frog       | pony        | goat          |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 6, the egyptian is on the far left. From clue 9, the person eating zucchini is on the right of the egyptian.

From clue 1, the person eating blueberry is on the far left or far right. Since the far left is already taken by the egyptian, the person eating blueberry must be on the far right (position 6).

From clue 15, the person eating cauliflower is on the left or right of the person eating blueberry. Therefore, the person eating cauliflower must be in position 5.

From clue 17, the person eating zucchini is the owner of the snake. From clue 8, the owner of the snake is on the left or right of the person eating peas. Since the person eating zucchini is already determined to be in position 2 or 3 (from clue 9), and the person eating blueberry is in position 6, the person eating peas must be in position 4.

From clue 12, the person eating peas is the owner of the rat.

From clue 16, the designer is the russian. From clue 3, the russian is on the left of the coach. Therefore, the russian (designer) is in position 2 or 3, and the coach is in position 4 or 5.

From clue 14, the teacher is between the person who's hobby is card-games and the person eating cauliflower. Since the person eating cauliflower is already determined to be in position 5, the teacher must be in position 4, and the person with the hobby of card-games must be in position 3.

From clue 25, the person who's hobby is video-games is in an even position (2 or 6). Since position 6 is already taken by the person eating blueberry, the person with the hobby of video-games must be in position 2.

From clue 10, the doctor is in an odd position. From clue 19, the doctor is on the far left or far right. Since position 1 is already taken by the egyptian, the doctor must be in position 6 (but this would conflict with the person eating blueberry being in position 6). Therefore, the doctor must actually be in position 5.

From clue 20, the person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the mexican. Since the mexican is already determined to be in position 4 or 5 (from clues 11 and 12), the person with the hobby of baking must be in position 6 (but this would conflict with the person eating blueberry being in position 6). Therefore, the mexican must actually be in position 3.

From clue 21, the architect is in an odd position. From clue 4, the owner of the hamster is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since the person with the hobby of gardening is already determined to be in position 3 (from clues 7 and 14), the owner of the hamster must be in position 2 or 4.

From clue 18, the owner of the hamster is in an even position. Therefore, the owner of the hamster must actually be in position 2.

The rest of the puzzle can be solved by using a combination of the remaining clues and logical deductions.

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:

* Started with clues that gave specific positions or relationships, such as the person eating grapefruit being in an odd position (clue 1) and the firefighter being on the far right (clue 18).
* Used clues to determine the nationalities and jobs for each column. For example, clue 10 states the Italian is a software-developer, which helped place the Italian and the software-developer.
* Filled in the beverages and food based on the relationships established earlier. Clues like ""the person eating carrot is on the left of the person driving the skateboard"" (clue 5) helped place specific food items and transportation methods.
* Finally, used clues to confirm and adjust any remaining uncertainties.

| Transport     | bus      | airplane    | scooter  | subway     | ship       | train       |

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:

From clue 26, the person who's hobby is drawing must be on the far left or far right. Clue 13 states that the person who's hobby is writing is in an odd position, so they can't be on the far left. Therefore, the person who's hobby is drawing is on the far left.

From clue 1 and 15, the owner of the cat is to the left of the owner of the turtle, and the fan of soul is on the right of the owner of the rat. Since the fan of soul is also the owner of the cat (clue 15), we can conclude that the owner of the rat is on the far left.

From clue 14, the person who's hobby is card-games is the fan of indie. Clue 6 states that the person driving the scooter is the fan of indie, so they must be in position 3 or 5 (since the person driving the scooter can't be on the far right).

Clue 25 and 12 state that the person who's hobby is cooking is on the left or right of the owner of the cat, and on the left or right of the person driving the ship. Since the person driving the ship is in position 5 (clue 21), we can conclude that the person who's hobby is cooking is in position 4.

The rest of the puzzle was solved using a combination of these initial conclusions and the remaining clues.
