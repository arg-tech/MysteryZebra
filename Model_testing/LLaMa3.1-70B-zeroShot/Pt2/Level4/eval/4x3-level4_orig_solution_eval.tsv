Lv4-4x3-1	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a possible solution:


|               |     1     |       2       |     3      |
| Food          |   Corn    |   Pepper     | Potato     |
| Hobby         | Drawing   | Rock-climbing| Skydiving  |
| Movie-Genre   | Musical   | Scientific  | Mystery    |
| Sport         | Baseball  | Climbing    | Surfing    |

 

Here's how I arrived at the solution:


From clue 6, we know that the person who's hobby is drawing is in an odd position. This means they can be either in position 1 or 3.


From clue 2, we know that the person watching musical movies is on the left or right of the person eating corn.


Combining these two clues, it's likely that the person who's hobby is drawing is also the one watching musical movies, and they are in position 1. This means the person eating corn is in position 1.


From clue 4, we know that the person eating potato is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. This means the person eating potato can't be in position 2 (since there would be no one to their left with a hobby), so they must be in position 3.


Now, looking at clue 1, we see that the person eating pepper is between the person who's hobby is drawing and the person who's sport is baseball. Given our current setup, this means the person eating pepper must be in position 2.


From clue 5, we know that the person eating pepper is on the left of the person watching scientific movies. This confirms that the person watching scientific movies is indeed in position 3 (since they are to the right of the person eating pepper).


Finally, clue 3 states that the person who's sport is climbing is on the right of the person who's sport is baseball. Given our current setup, this means the person whose sport is surfing must be in position 1, but we already know the person in position 1 eats corn and has drawing as their hobby. So, it must be that the person in position 2 (who eats pepper) has a different sport than climbing or baseball.


Putting all of these pieces together, we arrive at the solution above.

#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 2, we know the coach watches disaster movies.
* Clue 4 tells us that the owner of the guinea-pig is to the right of the coach.
* Clue 6 states that the photographer is in an even position, which means they must be in column 2 or none at all (since there are only 3 columns). But clue 5 says the person watching thriller movies is on either side of the photographer. Given the constraints, the photographer must be in column 2.
* Clue 7 tells us that the tennis player is between the coach and the accountant. Since the coach is already in column 2 (watching disaster movies), the tennis player must be in column 1.
* The only remaining job for column 3 is the photographer, which matches clue 6.
* From clue 5, we know the person watching thriller movies is next to the photographer. Since the photographer is in column 2, the person watching thriller movies must be in column 3.
* Clue 1 tells us that the action movie watcher is to the left of the baseball player. This means the action movie watcher must be in column 1 or 2. But clue 3 says they're also to the left of the ferret owner, so they can't be in column 3 (since there's no one to their right). Column 1 is already taken by the tennis player, so the action movie watcher must be in column 1.
* The remaining pet (hamster) and sport (baseball) can now be assigned to column 3.

And that's how I arrived at the final solution!"	{'job': ['accountant', 'coach', 'photographer'], 'movie-genre': ['action', 'disaster', 'thriller'], 'pet': ['ferret', 'guinea-pig', 'hamster'], 'sport': ['tennis', 'lacrosse', 'baseball']}	True	3	False
Lv4-4x3-3	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |     1      |   2    |     3     |
| Food          | carrot     |        | watermelon|

| Pet           | bird       | pony   | turtle     |
| Transport     | train      | bike   | quad-bike  |

Let me explain the reasoning:

From clue 2, we know that the person eating watermelon is driving the train. So, watermelon goes in column 3.

From clue 6, we know that the owner of the turtle is eating cranberry. Since the owner of the turtle is on the right of the person driving the bike (clue 1), and the person driving the bike can't be in column 3 (because the train is already there), the owner of the turtle must be in column 3, and the person driving the bike must be in column 2. Therefore, cranberry goes in column 3.

From clue 4, we know that the person eating carrot is between the person watching adventure movies and the person driving the train. Since watermelon (the person driving the train) is already in column 3, the person eating carrot must be in either column 1 or 2. But if they were in column 2, then the person watching adventure movies would have to be in column 1, which means there's no room for the bike (column 2). Therefore, the person eating carrot goes in column 1.

From clue 5, we know that the person watching action movies is in an even position, so they go in either column 2 or none of the above. But since family movies can't be in column 2 (because adventure and action would be on either side, leaving no room for carrot), action goes in column 2.

The rest falls into place:

* The person eating cranberry (turtle owner) is already in column 3.
* The bird's owner must be next to the person eating cranberry (clue 3), so they go in column 1 or 2. Since the person driving the bike is already in column 2, and there's no room for another pet, the bird goes in column 1.
* The pony is the only pet left, so it goes in column 2.
* Family movies are the only genre left, so they go in column 3.

Lv4-4x3-4	"After analyzing the clues, I've filled out the table as follows:


|               |      1       |      2      |      3      |

| Movie-Genre   | Documentary  | Mystery     | Martial-Arts|
| Nationality   | Pakistani    | British     | Italian      |

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve it:


From clue 4, we know the Italian is on the far right (column 3). From clue 6, we also know the Italian is on the right of the Pakistani. Therefore, the Pakistani must be in column 1 or 2.


From clue 5, the bartender is on the right of the Pakistani. This means the Pakistani cannot be in column 3 (since there's no one to their right), and the bartender can't be in column 1 (since they need someone to their left). So, the Pakistani must be in column 1, and the bartender in column 2.


From clue 7, the person who's hobby is woodworking is in an odd position. Given that there are only three columns, this means the person with woodworking as a hobby can't be in column 2 (which would leave no one on their left or right). So, they must be in either column 1 or 3.


From clue 2, we know the person watching documentary movies is to the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since the Pakistani is already in column 1 and can't have a hobby (from the above reasoning), the person with woodworking as a hobby must be in column 3. The documentary movie-watcher, then, must be in either column 1 or 2.


From clue 1, we know the chess player is on the left or right of the martial-arts movie-watcher. Since the engineer (who watches martial-arts movies) can't be in column 3 (from clue 4 and above reasoning), they must be in column 2 or 1.


Putting these pieces together:


* Column 1: Pakistani, watching documentaries (the only remaining genre), with photography as their hobby.
* Column 2: British bartender, watching mystery movies (the only remaining job/genre combo that fits).
* Column 3: Italian engineer, watching martial-arts movies and having chess as a hobby.

| Nationality   | mexican   | polish   | german          |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 2, we know the person drinking water is on the left of the person drinking juice. This gives us the beverage order: water, juice, coffee.

Clue 6 tells us the police-officer is on the right of the person drinking juice. Since the bartender can only be in an odd position (clue 3), and the manager is already on the left (from clue 2), the police-officer must be in position 2.

From clue 4, we know the manager is on the left of the fan of pop. With the manager already in position 1, this means the pop fan must be either in position 2 or 3. However, since the police-officer is already in position 2 (from above), the pop fan must be in position 3.

Now, clue 5 tells us the police-officer is on the left or right of the salsa fan. Given that the police-officer is in position 2 and the pop fan is in position 3, the salsa fan must be in position 1.

Clue 7 places the polish nationality in the middle (position 2). With this information, we can now place the remaining nationalities: mexican in position 1 and german in position 3.

Finally, with all positions filled except for the music-genre of the manager, it's clear that soul is the only option left.

Puzzle: 
 
There 3 different types of food: asparagus, cauliflower, raspberry
The people have 3 different jobs:  doctor, photographer, social-worker
The people perfer 3 different movie-genres: disaster, mystery, western
There are 3 different nationalities: dutch, italian, mexican

1. the person watching mystery movies is between the photographer and the person eating cauliflower##2
2. the dutch is the person eating asparagus
3. the person watching western movies is the italian
4. the italian is on the left of the social-worker
5. the dutch is in an even position##4
6. the dutch is on the right of the person eating raspberry


Solution: 


From clue 2, we can conclude that the dutch person eats asparagus.

From clue 5, we know that the dutch is in an even position, so they must be in either position 2 or none (since there are only three positions).

From clue 6, we know that the dutch person is on the right of the person eating raspberry. This means the person eating raspberry cannot be in position 3, since the dutch person would not be to their right.

So, the person eating raspberry must be in position 1, and the dutch person (eating asparagus) must be in position 2.

Now we know:

|               |      1       |       2       |
| Food          | Raspberry    | Asparagus     |

From clue 3, we know that the italian person watches western movies. And from clue 4, we know that the italian is on the left of the social-worker. 

Since the dutch person (in position 2) eats asparagus and cannot be a social worker (clue 4), it follows that either the photographer or doctor must eat cauliflower.

However, if the doctor ate cauliflower, then from clue 1, the person watching mystery movies would have to be on the right of the doctor (since they're between the photographer and the cauliflower eater). But this is impossible since there are no more people to their right.

Therefore, the photographer eats cauliflower. 

And from clue 1, we know that the person watching mystery movies must be in position 2 or 3. However, position 2 is taken by the dutch person (eating asparagus), so they cannot watch mystery movies. Thus, the person eating raspberry watches mystery movies.

Now we can complete the puzzle:

Lv4-4x3-7	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |   1    |     2     |   3    |
| Food          | garlic | blueberry | orange |
| Movie-Genre   | action | zombie    | crime  |
| Music-Genre   | metal  | ambient   | r&b    |
| Transport     | taxi   | roller    | car    |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 2, we know that the fan of metal is on the left of the person eating blueberry. Since blueberry is in the middle (clue 1), metal must be in position 1.

Clue 6 tells us that the fan of ambient is between the person driving the roller and the person eating garlic. Since the person watching zombie movies drives a roller (clue 3), ambient must be in position 2, and garlic must be in either position 1 or 3. But metal is already in position 1, so garlic must be in position 3.

Clue 5 says that the person eating orange is on the right of the person watching action movies. Since blueberry is in the middle, action movies must be in position 2 (because there's no room for another genre to the left of action). Crime movies are on either side of action movies (clue 4), so crime must be in position 3.

But wait, we already have garlic in position 3! So crime must actually be in position 1. And since metal is in position 1, this means that crime and metal belong to the same person, which is not possible. This is a contradiction!

Let's go back to clue 4: the person watching crime movies is on the left or right of the person watching action movies. What if we swap the positions of action and crime? Then we get:

|               |   1    |     2     |   3    |
| Food          | garlic | blueberry | orange |
| Movie-Genre   | crime  | zombie    | action |
| Music-Genre   | metal  | ambient   | r&b    |
| Transport     | taxi   | roller    | car    |

This seems to work! The person eating blueberry is in the middle (clue 1), and the fan of metal is on the left of the person eating blueberry (clue 2). The person watching zombie movies drives a roller (clue 3), and the person eating orange is on the right of the person watching action movies (clue 5).

Clue 6 tells us that the fan of ambient is between the person driving the roller and the person eating garlic. This works out, since ambient is in position 2.

Finally, clue 7 says that the person driving the taxi is in an odd position. And indeed, the person driving a taxi (garlic) is in position 1.

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

* From clue 2, we know soy-milk is on the far right (position 3).
* From clue 1, we know Russian is either on the far left or far right. Since soy-milk is already on the far right, Russian must be in position 2.
* From clue 6, we know car is in an odd position, which means it can only be in position 1 or 3. But since soy-milk is already in position 3, car must be in position 1.
* From clue 5, we know the person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the Pakistani. This means quad-bike cannot be in position 2 (since Russian is there), so it must be in position 1 or 3. But since car is already in position 1, quad-bike must be in position 3, which contradicts clue 5. Therefore, quad-bike must actually be in position 1.
* From clue 4, we know the person driving the quad-bike (in position 1) is on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing. This means dancing cannot be in position 1 or 2, so it must be in position 3.
* From clue 7, we know camping is between Pakistani and tram. Since Pakistani can't be in position 1 (quad-bike is there), Pakistani must be in either position 2 or 3. But since Russian is already in position 2, Pakistani must be in position 3, which means camping must be in position 2, and tram must be in position 3, but this contradicts the placement of soy-milk. Therefore, Pakistani must actually be in position 2, which means camping must be in position 1.
* From clue 6, we know hot-chocolate is in an odd position, which means it can only be in position 1 or 3. But since coffee is already in position 1 (deduced from the previous steps), and soy-milk is in position 3, hot-chocolate must be in position 2.
* From clue 7, we know camping is between Pakistani and tram. Since Pakistani is in position 2, and camping is in position 1, this means sudoku must be in position 2, which contradicts the placement of hot-chocolate. Therefore, sudoku must actually be in position 3.

From clue 7, we know the Turkish person is in an odd position (1 or 3), and from clue 5, the Colombian is on the left or right of the Turkish person. Also, clue 4 tells us that the owner of the lizard is to the left of the cabbage eater.

Clue 1 tells us that the Colombian is to the right of the person eating apricot, and since we already have a possible position for the Colombian in column 3 (based on clue 5), let's put the apricot eater in column 2:

From clue 6, we know that the owner of the horse is to the left of the fan of blues. Since we don't have any other information about column 1 yet, let's put the horse owner there and make them a fan of disco (the only music genre left for this position):

From clue 4, the owner of the lizard is to the left of the cabbage eater. This means column 1 can't be cabbage (since there's no one to the left of it), so let's put lemon in column 1 and make the Turkish person a fan of disco:

| Pet           | horse?   | lizard?  |            |


Clue 3 tells us the Turkish person owns a chinchilla. Let's put cabbage in column 3 and make the Canadian (the only remaining nationality) own the lizard:


|               |    1     |     2     |     3      |
| Food          | Lemon    | Apricot   | Cabbage?  |
| Music-Genre   | Disco    |  punk     | Blues?    |
| Nationality   | Turkish  | Canadian?| Colombian?|
| Pet           | horse?   | lizard?  |            |


Finally, let's put the remaining information together. The only music genre left for column 3 is blues, and since we don't have any other pets left to assign, the remaining pet (the chinchilla) must belong to the Turkish person in column 1:


|               |    1     |     2     |     3      |
| Food          | Lemon    | Apricot   | Cabbage?  |
| Music-Genre   | Disco    |  punk     | Blues     |
| Nationality   | Turkish  | Canadian?| Colombian?|
| Pet           | chinchilla| lizard   | horse     |


So, the solution is:

Lv4-4x3-10	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


|               |     1      |     2      |     3      |
| Job           | freelancer | dancer    | teacher   |
| Music-Genre   | electronic | classical | indie     |
| Nationality   | japanese  | thai      | chinese   |
| Transport     | snowmobile| roller    | van       |

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 2, we know that the fan of classical is the dancer.
From clue 4, we know that the fan of classical (dancer) is Thai.

Clue 6 tells us that the dancer is in an odd position, which means they are either in position 1 or 3. But since the Japanese person is on the left of the roller driver (clue 1), and there's no way for the Japanese person to be in position 2 (because then they would be driving a van or snowmobile, but not next to the roller), the Thai dancer must be in position 2.

From clue 7, we know that the teacher is either left or right of the dancer. Since the teacher can't be in position 1 (the Japanese person is already there), and the dancer is in position 2, the teacher must be in position 3.

Clue 3 tells us that the teacher is on the left of the indie fan, so the indie fan must be in position 3 as well. This means the freelancer must be in position 1.

From clue 5, we know that the snowmobile driver is on the left of the van driver. So, the snowmobile must be in position 1 and the van in position 3.

Since the roller can't be driven by the Japanese person (clue 1), it must be driven by either the Thai dancer or the Chinese teacher. But since the dancer is already driving nothing (they prefer to dance!), the roller must be driven by someone else, which means the Chinese person must drive the van and therefore be in position 3.

Finally, we have the electronic fan (freelancer) driving the snowmobile.

Here's the final table:
