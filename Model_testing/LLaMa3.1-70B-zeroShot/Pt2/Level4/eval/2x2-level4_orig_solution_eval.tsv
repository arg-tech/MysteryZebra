Lv4-2x2-1	"Let's analyze the clues:

Clue 1: The mechanic is in an even position.
This means the mechanic must be in position 2, since it's the only even position.

Clue 2: The teacher is the person who's hobby is collecting.
This means the teacher has a hobby of collecting.

Now, let's fill in the table:


#############
|         |     1      |     2      |
| Hobby   | card-games | collecting |
| Job     |            | mechanic    |

Since the teacher has a hobby of collecting (Clue 2), and the mechanic is already placed in position 2, the teacher must be in position 2 as well. This means the teacher's hobby is collecting.

However, we have two jobs: mechanic and teacher. Since the mechanic is already in position 2, the teacher must be in position 1.


#############
|         |     1      |     2      |
| Hobby   | card-games | collecting |
| Job     | teacher    | mechanic    |

This solution satisfies both clues."	{'hobby': ['card-games', 'collecting'], 'job': ['teacher', 'mechanic']}	True	2	False
Lv4-2x2-2	"Based on the given clues:


|            |    1     |       2       |

| Sport      |          |               |

From clue 2, we know the person drinking soy-milk is to the left of the person drinking coffee. Therefore:


|            |    1     |       2       |
| Beverage   | Soy-milk | Coffee        |
| Sport      |          |               |

From clue 1, we know the person who's sport is sailing is in an odd position (i.e., position 1). Therefore:


|            |    1     |       2       |
| Beverage   | Soy-milk | Coffee        |
| Sport      | Sailing  | Weightlifting |

The final solution table is:

Lv4-2x2-3	"Based on the clues provided, here is the solved logic puzzle:


|               |    1     |    2    |
| Music-Genre   |  House   | Ambient |
| Nationality   | Canadian | Turkish |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

* Clue 2 states that ""the fan of house is on the left of the fan of ambient"", so I placed the fan of house in position 1.
* Since there are only two nationalities, and clue 1 says ""the canadian is in an odd position"", it means the Canadian must be in position 1 (since position 2 would be even).
* The remaining space for nationality is filled by Turkish.

Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:


#############

Lv4-2x2-4	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 1, we know that the person drinking lemonade is to the right of the person drinking 7up.

Since there are only two positions, this means that the person drinking 7up must be in position 1, and the person drinking lemonade must be in position 2.

The table now looks like this:

|            |    1     |    2     |
| Beverage   | 7up      | Lemonade |
| Food       |          |          |

From clue 2, we know that the person eating mango is in an even position. Since there are only two positions, and position 2 is even, this means that the person eating mango must be in position 2.

The table now looks like this:

|            |    1     |    2     |
| Beverage   | 7up      | Lemonade |
| Food       |          | Mango     |

Finally, since broccoli is the only food left, it must be paired with the person drinking 7up in position 1.

The final solution table is:

#############
|            |    1     |    2     |
| Beverage   | 7up      | Lemonade |

Lv4-2x2-5	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 1, we know that the Dutch person is in an even position, which means they must be in column 2.

From clue 2, we know that the social-worker is to the right of the fisherman. Since there are only two columns, this means the fisherman must be in column 1 and the social-worker must be in column 2.

Now, let's fill in the table:


|               |     1     |       2       |
| Job           | Fisherman | Social-Worker |
| Nationality   |           | Dutch         |

We still need to determine the nationality of the fisherman. Since the Dutch person is already accounted for, the fisherman must be Polish.


|               |     1     |       2       |
| Job           | Fisherman | Social-Worker |

Lv4-2x2-6	"Based on the clues provided, I'll try to solve the logic puzzle.

From clue 1, we know that the person driving the motorbike is in an even position, which means they are in column 2 (since there are only two columns).

From clue 2, we know that the person driving the ship is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing. This implies that the person driving the ship is in column 1.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|             |   1   |     2     |
| Sport       |       |           |
| Transport   | Ship  | Motorbike |

The only remaining information to fill in is the sport. Since there are two sports and two columns, we can deduce that climbing must be on the right side of ship (since ship is already occupied), which means rugby must be on the left.

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|             |   1   |     2     |
| Sport       | Rugby | Climbing  |

Lv4-2x2-7	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The journalist is in an even position, which means they must be in column 2.
2. The person whose hobby is gardening is to the left of the journalist, which means they must be in column 1.

So far, we have:

| Hobby   | Gardening  |            |
| Job     |             | Journalist |

Now, let's fill in the remaining blanks. Since there are only two hobbies and jobs left, we can deduce that:

* The person with the hobby Sudoku must be in column 2.
* The firefighter job is left for column 1.

Here's the completed table:


#############
|         |      1      |     2      |

Lv4-2x2-8	"Based on the clues provided:


The Australian cannot be in position 2 since it would not be to the left of the Pakistani.


Since the owner of the frog is in an odd position, and there are only two positions, the owner of the frog must be in position 1.


Now we have the following information:

| Nationality   | Australian|           |
| Pet           | Frog       |           |

The only remaining pet is the dog, and the only remaining nationality is Pakistani. Therefore:

1. The Canadian is in an even position.
Since there are only two positions, this means the Canadian must be in position 2.

2. The electrician is to the right of the doctor.
This means the electrician must be in position 2, and the doctor must be in position 1.


Now, let's fill in the table:

 Wait, we still need to determine the nationality of person 1. Since person 2 is Canadian, and there are only two nationalities (Canadian and German), person 1 must be German.

From clue (2), we know that the fan of country is in an even position, which means they must be at position 2.


Since there are only two positions and two music-genres, the fan of folk must be at position 1.

Now, from clue (1), we know that the fan of folk is eating corn. So, the person at position 1 must be eating corn.


The only food left is blueberry, which must be eaten by the person at position 2, who is a fan of country.
