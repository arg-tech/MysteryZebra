After analyzing the given clues:

From clue 6 (same as clue 4), we know French is watching crime movies.

From clue 2, French is to the left of Nigerian.

From clue 3, Nigerian is in an odd position. Since positions 1 and 3 are the only odd positions, Nigerian can be either at position 1 or 3. However, since French (crime) is to the left of Nigerian (clue 2), and considering French cannot be on the right side because it's on the left of Nigerian, Nigerian must be at position 3.

From clue 4 (same as clue 6), we already placed French watching crime movies. Given the layout so far:
- Position 1: French (crime)
- Position 3: Nigerian

From clue 5, German is to the right of Nigerian. So, German must be at position 4.

From clue 2 and deduction above:
- Position 1: French (crime)
- Position 2: unknown
- Position 3: Nigerian
- Position 4: German

Now, looking at movie-genre clues:

From clue 1, the person watching musical movies is to the left of the person watching superhero movies. Since French is already placed and Nigerian's position doesn't fit this description well due to its fixed placement from other clues, we deduce that the only arrangement for this condition (considering available positions) would place Musical at position 2 and Superhero at position 4 or vice versa, but since German is at position 4, it must be watching superhero movies.

This leaves us with Scientific as an option for Nigerian. 

The final solution table:

|# Nationality   | French     | Russian| Nigerian  | German     |

Note: The person watching musical movies being to the left of the superhero movies clue, combined with other nationality and movie genre clues, led us to conclude that the only position left for Russian (the remaining nationality) was at position 2."	{'movie-genre': ['crime', 'musical', 'scientific', 'superhero'], 'nationality': ['french', 'russian', 'nigerian', 'german']}	True	3	False
Lv4-2x4-3	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 2, we know the person eating pomegranate is in an even position. This means they can be in either position 2 or 4.

From clue 6, we know the person eating grapes is on the right of the person eating pomegranate. This means that if pomegranate is in position 2, grapes must be in position 3, and if pomegranate is in position 4, grapes cannot be on their right (since there's no position 5). Therefore, pomegranate must be in position 2, and grapes must be in position 3.

From clue 1, we know the person eating watermelon is on the left or right of the person watching western movies. Since western movies can't be in position 3 (because grapes are there), western movies must be either in position 2 or 4. But pomegranate is already in position 2, so western movies must be in position 4.

From clue 3, we know the person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person eating grapes. Since western movies are in position 4 and grapes are in position 3, this fits perfectly.

From clue 5, we know the person watching animation movies is in an odd position. This means they can be in either position 1 or 3. But position 3 is taken by grapes, so animation movies must be in position 1.

The only remaining positions are for spy and documentary movies. From clue 4, we know western movies are on the right of spy movies, which means spy movies must be in position 2 doesn't work (since pomegranate is there), but what if spy movies were before animation? That would make documentary movies fit perfectly in position 3's neighbor â€“ nope that also doesn't work since grapes are there. So the person watching spy can only fit on the left of western and so has to be at the end.

The completed table looks like this:


|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |      4      |
| Food          | carrot     | pomegranate | grapes    | watermelon  |
| Movie-Genre   | animation  | documentary | spy        | western       |

Wait a minute we still need to fit the carrots and documentary to their correct places

Since there's only one option for position of carrots left it is at 1.

 documentary can now only be at number 2 since all other positions are filled up.



So Final solution table looks like this:




|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |      4      |

| Movie-Genre   | animation  | documentary | spy        | western       |

Wait a minute we still need to fit the spy to its correct places

Since there's only one option for position of spy left it is at 3.



So Final solution table looks like this:




|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |      4      |

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

1. From clue 2, we know that woodworking is on the left of cooking.
2. From clue 5, we know that folk is on the right of cooking, so cooking must be in position 2.
3. From clue 4, we know that folk is on the left of reggae, and since folk is already placed next to cooking, reggae must be in position 4.
4. From clue 1, we know that drawing is between blues and reggae, so drawing must be in position 3.
5. The only remaining hobby is reading, which goes to position 4 (but actually it doesn't fit there), it should go to the last available place for hobbies: position 4, switching with reggae's place. Reggae goes to position 4 and reading to none of those places, just switch woodworking for reading and that's the final solution.
6. From clue 3, we know that indie is in an odd position. Since position 1 is the only available odd position left, indie must be in position 1.

With these steps, we can fill in the rest of the table to arrive at the final solution."	{'hobby': ['woodworking', 'cooking', 'drawing', 'reading'], 'music-genre': ['indie', 'folk', 'blues', 'reggae']}	True	6	False
Lv4-2x4-5	"Based on the given clues, let's solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 2, we know that the Australian is a fan of punk music.

From clue 4, we know that the fan of hip-hop music is on the far left (position 1).

From clue 6, we know that the American is either on the far left or far right. Since the far left is already occupied by the hip-hop fan, the American must be on the far right.

Here's what we have so far:

|               |    1     |    2    |   3    |     4      |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop |         |        |            |
| Nationality   |          |         |        | american   |

From clue 5, we know that the fan of jazz is in an odd position, which means it must be either position 1 or 3. Since position 1 is already occupied by the hip-hop fan, the fan of jazz must be in position 3.

Now, let's look at clue 1: ""The fan of jazz is on the right of the Russian"". This means that the Russian must be in position 2 (since the fan of jazz is in position 3).

Here's what we have so far:

|               |    1     |    2    |   3    |     4      |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop |         | jazz   |            |
| Nationality   |          | russian |        | american   |

From clue 3, we know that the Indian is on the right of the fan of folk music. This means that the fan of folk music must be in position 1 or 2 (since the Indian can't be in position 4, which would put the fan of folk in a non-existent position 5).

Since position 1 is already occupied by the hip-hop fan, and we don't have enough information to place the fan of folk in position 2 yet, let's move on to clue 2. We know that the Australian is a fan of punk music.

From the previous steps, we can see that positions 1, 3, and 4 are already occupied by specific nationalities or music genres. This means that the Australian must be in position 2 (since it's the only remaining option).

Here's what we have so far:

|               |    1     |    2    |   3    |     4      |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop | punk   | jazz   |            |
| Nationality   |          | australian|        | american   |

Now, let's go back to clue 3. We know that the Indian is on the right of the fan of folk music. This means that the fan of folk music must be in position 1 or 2 (since the Indian can't be in position 4, which would put the fan of folk in a non-existent position 5).

Since position 1 is already occupied by the hip-hop fan, and position 2 is occupied by the Australian punk fan, we can conclude that the fan of folk music must not be in these positions. This means that clue 3 was trying to mislead us!

However, this also means that we have a contradiction: if the Indian is on the right of the fan of folk music, and there's no more room for the fan of folk music, then something's amiss.

Wait a minute... What if the fan of folk music is actually in position 4? That would mean the American (in position 4) is also the fan of folk music!

And what about the Indian? Clue 3 says that the Indian is on the right of the fan of folk music. But since the fan of folk music is now in position 4, we can conclude that there's no more room for the Indian to be ""on the right"" of anyone. This means that clue 3 was actually saying something else entirely...

If we read clue 3 carefully again, it says: ""The Indian is on the **right** of the fan of folk"". What if this meant that the Indian is in a position that's ""farther to the right"" than the folk fan? This would put the Indian in... position 2!

But wait, position 2 is already occupied by the Australian punk fan! We have another contradiction...

And then it hits us: what if clue 3 was actually saying that the **Indian is the one who's a fan of folk music**?! If so, we can disregard our previous assumptions about positions and nationalities.

With this new insight, let's start fresh:

|               |    1     |    2    |   3    |     4      |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop |         | jazz   |            |
| Nationality   |          | russian |        | american   |

We know that the Australian is a fan of punk music (clue 2). We can put them in position 2:

|               |    1     |    2    |   3    |     4      |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop | punk   | jazz   |            |
| Nationality   |          | australian| russian| american |

Now, let's place the Indian as the fan of folk music (our new insight). We can put them in position 2... but wait, that's occupied by the Australian! So we'll put the Indian in position 1 instead:

|               |    1     |    2    |   3    |     4      |
| Music-Genre   | folk    | punk   | jazz   |            |
| Nationality   | indian  | australian| russian| american |

# Movie-Genre   |  Epic    | Documentary | Animation  | Time-travel|
# Nationality   | Japanese | Indonesian  | Malaysian  | Italian    |

Here's the step-by-step solution:

From clue 1, we know the Italian is in an even position. Since there are only two even positions (2 and 4), the Italian can be in either of these.

From clue 3, we know the person watching epic movies is in an odd position. This means they must be in position 1 or 3. 

Since the Japanese is on the left or right of the Indonesian (clue 5) and considering the positions available, it's more likely that the Indonesian is not at position 1 (as this would limit the options for the Japanese). So let's place Epic in position 1.

Now we know the Italian can't be in position 1 (odd), so they must be in an even position. From clue 2, the person watching time-travel movies must be on the right of the Italian. This means the Italian must be in position 2 and Time-Travel must be in position 4.

Now we know from clue 5 that the Japanese is either to the left or right of the Indonesian. The only possible arrangement for this, given our current setup, is for the Indonesian to be next to the Malaysian (as there's no other space available). We also know from clue 4 that the Indonesian must be on the left of Animation.

The final solution can then be derived as follows:

- Epic at position 1 (Japanese)
- Italian at position 2, which means Documentary is likely their preferred genre.
- Indonesian and Malaysian in positions 3 (Animation) since the Indonesian cannot be to the right of Animation.
- The Japanese must therefore be next to the Indonesian but has no other choice than being at position 1, making it impossible for another person to watch epic movies. Therefore the table starts with Epic at position 1 (Japanese)

Lv4-2x4-7	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:

|               | Roller | Car     | Quad-bike| Ship     |
#################


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue (4), we know the person driving the ship is watching epic movies, so that eliminates positions 1-3 for epic.

Clue (2) tells us the roller is on the left of the car. Since there are only two positions to the left of the car (1 and 2), roller must be in either position 1 or 2.

From clue (5), western movies are on the left or right of the person driving the car. Given that epic movies can't be in positions 1-3, this means western movies can only be in position 1.

Now we know roller is in position 1 and western movies are also in position 1, so they must match up.

From clue (6), the quad-bike is on the right of the car. This means the car cannot be in position 4 (since there's no space to the right). So, the car must be in position 2 or 3.

Given that western movies are in position 1 and mystery movies come after them (clue 3), we can deduce that family movies must be in position 2, since epic is already eliminated from positions 1-3.

This leaves us with:

* Position 1: Western - Roller
* Position 2: Family - Car
* Position 3: Mystery - Quad-bike (since it's on the right of the car)
* Position 4: Epic - Ship

The final solution matches this configuration:

Lv4-2x4-9	"Let's break down the clues:

From clue 1, we know that the person eating pepper is on the left or right of the person eating cabbage.

From clue 2, we know that the person eating cabbage is on the right of the person eating mango. This means the order is: ... -> mango -> cabbage -> ...

Combining these two clues, we get: ... -> mango -> cabbage -> pepper (or) ... -> pepper -> mango -> cabbage

From clue 4, we know that the owner of the cat is in an odd position, which means they can be in positions 1 or 3.

From clue 5, we know that the person eating pepper is the owner of the mouse. This doesn't give us a direct placement yet.

From clue 3, we know that the owner of the cat is between the owner of the hamster and the person eating pepper. Since the owner of the cat can only be in positions 1 or 3 (from clue 4), this means that the person eating pepper must be in position 2 or 4.

Considering all these constraints, we get:

|        |     1      |    2    |    3    |   4    |
| Food   |            |         |         |        |
| Pet    |            |         |         |        |

We can try to fit the owner of the cat in position 1 or 3.

Case 1: Owner of the cat is in position 1
Then, the person eating pepper must be in position 2 (to satisfy clue 3). But this means that the owner of the hamster cannot be on one side of the cat's owner. So, we can reject this case.

Case 2: Owner of the cat is in position 3
Then, the person eating pepper must be in position 4 (to satisfy clue 3).

Using clue 5, we know that the person eating pepper owns the mouse. So, we get:

|        |     1      |    2    |    3    |   4    |
| Food   |            |         |         |        |
| Pet    |            |         | cat     | mouse  |

Now, we can use clue 2 to place the cabbage and mango. We get:

|        |     1      |    2    |    3    |   4    |
| Food   | mango     | cabbage | ???    | pepper |
| Pet    |            |         | cat     | mouse  |

The only food left is watermelon, so it must be in position 2.

| Food   | mango     | cabbage | watermelon | pepper |

From clue 1, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is a fan of jazz.

From clue 4, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is in an odd position, so it must be either position 1 or 3.


Let's start by assuming that the person drinking almond-milk is in position 1. Then, from clue 2, the fan of disco would be in position 2.


But then, from clue 5, the fan of jazz (who drinks almond-milk) must be on the left or right of the fan of disco, which means they cannot be in position 1 (because there is no one to their left). This contradicts our initial assumption.


Therefore, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 3.


Now, from clue 2, the fan of disco would be in position 4.


From clue 5, we know that the fan of jazz (who drinks almond-milk) is on the left or right of the fan of disco. Since they are already in position 3, and the fan of disco is in position 4, this means that the person drinking juice must be in position 2.


From clue 6, we know that the person drinking cola is on the left or right of the fan of dubstep. The only remaining positions are 1 and 2, but since the person drinking juice is already in position 2, the person drinking cola must be in position 1.


The remaining music-genre to fill is electronic, which must belong to the person drinking soy-milk (since all other beverages have been assigned). This means that dubstep belongs to the person drinking juice.
