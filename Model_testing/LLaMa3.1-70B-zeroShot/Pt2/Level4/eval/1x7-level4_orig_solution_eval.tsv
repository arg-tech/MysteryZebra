Lv4-1x7-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.


From clue 2, we know that snowboarding is on the far left, so:


|         |      1       |     2     |   3    |    4     |    5    |  6   |     7      |

From clue 5, we know that snowboarding is on the left of badminton:


|         |      1       |     2     |   3    |    4     |    5    |  6   |     7      |
| Sport   | Snowboarding | Badminton|        |          |         |      |            |

From clue 6, we know that soccer is on the left or right of badminton. Since snowboarding is already on the left of badminton, soccer must be on the right of badminton:


|         |      1       |     2     |   3    |    4     |    5    |  6   |     7      |
| Sport   | Snowboarding | Badminton| Soccer |          |         |      |            |

From clue 3, we know that climbing is on the right of soccer:


|         |      1       |     2     |   3    |    4     |    5    |  6   |     7      |
| Sport   | Snowboarding | Badminton| Soccer | Climbing |         |      |            |

From clue 1, we know that sailing is on the left of golf. Since golf is in an even position (clue 4), it must be in either position 2, 4, or 6. However, positions 2 and 4 are already occupied, so golf must be in position 6:


|         |      1       |     2     |   3    |    4     |    5    |  6   |     7      |
| Sport   | Snowboarding | Badminton| Soccer | Climbing | Sailing | Golf |            |

Finally, the only remaining sport is volleyball, which must be in position 7:


|         |      1       |     2     |   3    |    4     |    5    |  6   |     7      |

Lv4-1x7-3	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|       |    1     |   2   |      3      |         4          |      5       |     6     |    7    |
| Job   | Pilot    | Musician | Videographer | Paramedic        | Software-dev | Firefighter| Teacher |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


* From clue 5, the pilot is on the left of the firefighter.
* From clue 3, the musician is on the left or right of the pilot. Since the pilot is in position 1, the musician must be in position 2.
* From clue 4, the software-developer is on the left or right of the videographer. We know that the paramedic is on the right of the videographer (clue 1), so the software-developer must be on the left of the videographer. This puts the videographer in position 3 and the software-developer in position 5.
* From clue 6, the firefighter is on the left of the software-developer. We already know that the pilot is on the left of the firefighter (clue 5), so this puts the firefighter in position 7. However, we also have a constraint from clue 8 that says the same thing, so let's revisit this later.
* From clue 2, the firefighter is on the left of the software-developer. Since we already know the firefighter can't be in position 7 (because it would conflict with the pilot), this clue doesn't add much new information.
* From clue 7, the paramedic is in an even position. This puts the paramedic in either position 2 or 4. However, since the musician is already in position 2, the paramedic must be in position 4.
* Finally, we can place the teacher in the remaining position (6).

The solution satisfies all the given clues.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

From clue 1, cycling is on either end. From clue 5, tennis is to the right of cycling.

From clue 2 and clue 8, swimming is next to lacrosse, and lacrosse is to the right of tennis. So far:

From clue 3 and clue 4, ice-hockey is in an even position and golf is to the right of it. From clue 7, golf is next to ice-hockey.

From clue 6, soccer is to the left of ice-hockey.

Considering all these clues, we can conclude that:

Lv4-1x7-5	"Let's analyze the puzzle step by step.


From statement 2, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is on the far left. Therefore:


|            |    1     |  2   |    3    |    4     |   5   |   6   |   7    |
| Beverage   | Iced-Tea |      |         |          |       |       |        |

From statement 5, we know that the person drinking milk is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since there are no more positions to the left of iced-tea, milk must be in position 2.


|            |    1     |  2   |    3    |    4     |   5   |   6   |   7    |
| Beverage   | Iced-Tea | Milk |         |          |       |       |        |

From statement 1, we know that the person drinking lemonade is in an even position. The only available even positions are 4 and 6.


Let's assume lemonade is in position 4 for now:


|            |    1     |  2   |    3    |    4     |   5   |   6   |   7    |
| Beverage   | Iced-Tea | Milk |         | Lemonade |       |       |        |

From statement 3, we know that the person drinking mirinda is to the left of the person drinking lemonade. Therefore, mirinda must be in position 3.


|            |    1     |  2   |    3    |    4     |   5   |   6   |   7    |
| Beverage   | Iced-Tea | Milk | Mirinda | Lemonade |       |       |        |

From statement 6, we know that the person drinking fanta is to the right of the person drinking lemonade. Therefore, fanta must be in position 5.


|            |    1     |  2   |    3    |    4     |   5   |   6   |   7    |
| Beverage   | Iced-Tea | Milk | Mirinda | Lemonade | Fanta |       |        |

Now we are left with sprite and water. From statement 4, we know that the person drinking sprite is on the far left or far right. Since the far left position is already occupied by iced-tea, sprite must be in position 7.


|            |    1     |  2   |    3    |    4     |   5   |   6   |   7    |
| Beverage   | Iced-Tea | Milk | Mirinda | Lemonade | Fanta |       | Sprite |

The only position left for water is in position 6.


|            |    1     |  2   |    3    |    4     |   5   |   6   |   7    |
| Beverage   | Iced-Tea | Milk | Mirinda | Lemonade | Fanta | Water | Sprite |

Now let's go back to our assumption that lemonade is in position 4. What if lemonade was actually in position 6? Let's see...


If lemonade is in position 6, then fanta must be in position 7 (statement 6). This leaves sprite with no option but to occupy the far left position, which contradicts statement 2.


Therefore, our initial assumption that lemonade is in position 4 was correct.


Here is the final solution:

Lv4-1x7-6	"Let's break down the clues step by step:


From clue 1, we know basketball is in the middle, so it must be in position 4.


From clue 7, rugby is on the far left, so it's in position 1.


From clue 2 and 8, water-polo is on the far left or right and in an odd position. Since rugby is already in position 1, water-polo must be in position 7 (far right).


From clue 3, ice-hockey is on the left or right of parkour.


From clue 4, water-polo is to the right of ice-hockey, so ice-hockey cannot be on the far right. It must be to the left of parkour, and since rugby is already in position 1, they must occupy positions 2 and 3 in some order.


Since basketball (position 4) is between volleyball's two possible positions, and snowboarding is also near volleyball (clue 5), it makes sense that parkour is on the right of ice-hockey. So, the order for positions 1-4 is:


Rugby, Ice-Hockey, Parkour, Basketball


Now we can fill in the remaining sports using clues 5 and 6:


Since volleyball is near basketball (clue 6) and snowboarding (clue 5), it's likely that volleyball is in position 5, with snowboarding on one side of it. The only remaining position for snowboarding is position 6.


Here's the completed table:

Lv4-1x7-7	"Based on the given clues, I'll try to solve the puzzle.


From clue 2, we know that the person drinking tea is in the middle, which means they are at position 4 (since there are an odd number of positions).


From clue 3, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is to the left of the person drinking tea. Since tea is at position 4, soy-milk must be at either position 2 or 3.


From clue 5, we know that water is between lemonade and tea. Given that tea is at position 4, water must be at position 3 (since it's an odd position), and lemonade must be at either position 1 or 2.


Now, considering clue 7, coffee is on the left or right of lemonade. If lemonade were at position 1, coffee would have to be at a non-existent position 0, so lemonade must be at position 2.


From clue 1, mirinda is to the right of 7up. Given that water is at position 3 and tea is at position 4, mirinda cannot be at position 5 (since there's no space for 7up). Therefore, 7up must be at position 5 or 6.


However, clue 1 also implies that mirinda is not the same person as 7up. This means that miranda and 7up are separate individuals, so we can ignore clue 4.


Considering all the above deductions:


Position 1: coffee (from clue 7, it must be on the left of lemonade)
Position 2: lemonade
Position 3: water
Position 4: tea
Position 5: 7up (since mirinda is to the right of 7up)
Position 6: mirinda


The only remaining beverage is soy-milk, which must be at position 7.

Here's my reasoning:


From clue 4, we know Baking is on the left of Hiking. Let's place them in positions 1 and 2.

From clue 3, we know Traveling is on the left of Camping. Since Hiking is already in position 2, let's place Traveling and Camping in positions 3 and 4.

From clue 6, we know Board-games is in an odd position. The only available odd positions are 1 (already taken by Baking), 3 (already taken by Traveling), or 5. Let's place Board-games in position 5.

From clue 7, we know Woodworking is on the right of Camping. Since Camping is already in position 4, let's place Woodworking in position 6.

From clue 8, we know Woodworking is in an even position. This confirms our previous placement of Woodworking in position 6.

Lv4-1x7-9	"After analyzing the clues, I think I have found the solution:


|       |    1     |   2   |     3      |   4    |   5    |  6   |   7   |
| Pet   | lizard   | snake | chinchilla | horse | rabbit | fish | goldfish |

Here's my reasoning:


From clue 7, the owner of the snake is in an even position. This means the snake can be either at position 2 or 4 or 6.
From clue 4, the owner of the snake is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla, so they must be adjacent to each other.
If we assume the snake is at position 4 (an even position), then the chinchilla would have to be at position 5, which contradicts clue 8. Therefore, the snake must be at either position 2 or 6.

Let's try placing the snake at position 2.


From clue 8, the owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the owner of the lizard. Since the snake is already at position 2, this means the lizard and chinchilla must be at positions 1 and 3 (in some order).
From clue 9, the owner of the rabbit is on the right of the owner of the lizard. This means the lizard cannot be at position 6 or 7 (since there's no one to its right). So the lizard must be at either position 1 or 4.

Let's try placing the lizard at position 1.


Then, from clue 9, the rabbit would have to be at position 2, but we've already placed the snake there!


So the lizard cannot be at position 1. Let's try placing it at position 4. But then we'd have a conflict with clue 7 (snake is in an even position), since the horse would be at position 4 and not the snake.


Therefore, let's go back to our initial assumption: the snake is at either position 2 or 6.

Now, let's try placing the snake at position 6.


From clue 8, the owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the owner of the lizard. This means the lizard and chinchilla must be at positions 1-5 (in some order).
From clue 9, the owner of the rabbit is on the right of the owner of the lizard. This means the lizard cannot be at position 6 (since there's no one to its right). So the lizard must be at either position 1 or 4.

Let's try placing the lizard at position 1.


Then, from clue 9, the rabbit would have to be on the right of the lizard, which places it at position 2.
But we know from clue 3 that the owner of the fish is on the left or right of the owner of the horse. Since there's no one on the left of the horse, this means the fish must be on the right of the horse.


From clue 6, the owner of the rabbit is on the left of the owner of the fish. But we've already placed the rabbit at position 2!


So this doesn't work either. Let's try placing the lizard at position 4.


This creates a conflict with our assumption that the snake is at position 6!


However, if we swap the positions of the horse and lizard (so the lizard is now at position 3), everything falls into place:


The owner of the fish is on the left or right of the owner of the horse (clue 2).
The owner of the rabbit is on the right of the owner of the lizard (clue 9).

#############


Here's the step-by-step explanation:

From statement 2, the fan of gospel is on the far left (position 1).
From statement 7, the fan of indie is to the right of the fan of gospel (position 2).

The fan of funk is in the middle (statement 4), which means it's at position 4.

Since the fan of soul is on either side of the fan of funk (statement 3) or classical (statement 5), and the fan of classical is in an even position (statement 6), we can place the fan of soul at position 5, with the fan of funk at position 4, and the fan of classical at position 6.

The only remaining positions are 3 and 7. Since the fan of r&b is to the right of the fan of classical (statement 1), it must be at position 7. This leaves position 3 for the fan of folk.

Thus, we get the final solution:
