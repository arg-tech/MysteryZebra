From statement 1, we know that the accountant is on the far left or far right. Since it can't be on the far right (already taken by analyst), it must be on the far left.

From statement 11, we know that the accountant is on the left of the person watching western movies.

From statement 14, we know that the person driving the snowmobile is the analyst.


|               |     1      |     2     |     3      |     4      |

From statement 4, we know that the person watching superhero movies is in an odd position. The only available odd positions are columns 1 and 3.

The only odd position left for a new beverage is position 1 (but this is already occupied by juice), so it must be either position 1 or not exist (but since we have a complete set of beverages, it has to be position 1 or 3). However position 3 is also an odd position and the only one left that can accommodate cola.

However position 3 is already occupied by Thriller movies which also comes with soul music-genre.
Let's go back to step before we added fanta in position 2.


|               |      1       |      2       |    3    |      4      |
| Beverage      | Juice        |              |         | Sprite     |
| Hobby         | Magic-Tricks | Board-Games |         |             |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy       | Animation   | Thriller|             |
| Music-Genre   | Electronic   | Blues       | Soul    |             |
| Sport         | Climbing     | Soccer      | Cycling |             |

Now, we know that Cola has to be in an odd position (1 or 3), 
Also, from clue 2, Fanta is on the right of comedy movies. However since position 3 is taken by thriller and soul which also comes with cycling. The only option left for fanta is to swap places with Thriller/Soul/Cycling.


|               |      1       |      2       |    3    |      4      |
| Beverage      | Juice        |              |         | Sprite     |
| Hobby         | Magic-Tricks | Board-Games |         |             |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy       | Thriller    | Animation|             |
| Music-Genre   | Electronic   | Soul        | Blues    |             |
| Sport         | Climbing     | Cycling     | Soccer   |             |

Finally, the only odd position left is position 1 (but this is occupied by juice), so Cola has to be in position 3.
However we already have Animation and blues in position 3. So, these two need to swap places with Cola.


|               |      1       |      2       |    3    |      4      |
| Beverage      | Juice        |              | Cola     | Sprite     |
| Hobby         | Magic-Tricks | Board-Games |         |             |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy       | Thriller    | Animation|             |
| Music-Genre   | Electronic   | Soul        | Blues    |             |
| Sport         | Climbing     | Cycling     | Soccer   |             |

The last thing we need to find is the hobby for position 3.
We have already used Magic-Tricks and Board-Games in positions 1 and 2 respectively, so either of these can be used here.


However we also know from clue that there are four hobbies - Magic-Tricks, Camping, Board-Games, Singing. 
So, one of camping or singing has to be in position 3.
This also completes our table.

Lv4-5x4-4	"After carefully analyzing the clues, I've constructed a possible solution for the puzzle:

| Transport     |           |            |             |                 |

Here is the solution:


#############

| Job        | librarian  | bartender  | scientist  | project-manager|
| Music-Genre| rock       | trance      | reggae     | hip-hop        |

| Transport  | jet-ski    | snowmobile | quad-bike  | tram           |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning behind the solution:


From clue 1, we know the owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the owner of the snake. Combining this with clue 8, we can conclude that the person driving the quad-bike (hedgehog) must be in position 3.

Clue 2 tells us the fan of rock is the person who's hobby is gardening. Clue 5 places the owner of the cat on the far left, and clue 7 indicates the owner of the horse is on either side of the cat. Since the owner of the hedgehog (quad-bike) is in position 3, the only option for the owner of the snake is position 2.

Clue 6 places the person driving the snowmobile on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games. This means the scientist (clue 12) must be either in position 1 or 3. However, clue 11 indicates the scientist is in an odd position, so it must be in position 1.

Clues 4 and 13 provide additional constraints for positions 2-4. Clue 9 restricts the positions of the fans of hip-hop and reggae.

The remaining clues (10, 14, and 15) help us finalize the job assignments and transportation means.

Lv4-5x4-9	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:

| Sport         | ice-hockey | surfing    | badminton | cycling    |
| Transport     | skateboard | snowmobile | motorbike | bike       |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 10, we know the owner of the snake is on the far left.


Clue 7 tells us that the person watching zombie movies is in an even position. Since there are only two even positions (2 and 4), and the far left is already occupied by the snake owner, the zombie movie fan must be in position 4 or have a different movie genre in position 2. However, clue 6 tells us that the person driving the skateboard is watching superhero movies, so the zombie movie fan can't be in position 2.


Clue 11 says the motorbike driver is on the left of the hamster owner. Since the far right (position 4) is not adjacent to any other positions, it means the motorbike driver and the hamster owner must be in either positions 1-2 or 2-3.


However, clue 1 tells us that the hamster owner is on the far left or far right, so the hamster owner can only be in position 4. Therefore, the motorbike driver must be in position 3.


Clue 8 says the snake owner is on the left of the bike rider. Since the snake owner is already determined to be in position 1, it means the bike rider must be in an even position (2 or 4), but not 4 since the hamster owner occupies that spot. Thus, the bike rider is in position 2.


Now, let's consider clue 9: the person who's sport is cycling drives a snowmobile. Since there are only two remaining positions for sports (positions 3 and 4), we can deduce that the cycling enthusiast must be driving the snowmobile in position 2 or 4. However, position 2 is already occupied by the bike rider, so it means the cycling enthusiast is in position 4.


With this information, we can fill in some more of the table:


|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |     4      |
| Movie-Genre   |            |            |           |            |
| Nationality   | canadian   | thai       | indonesian| indian     |
| Pet           | snake      | frog       | hedgehog  | hamster    |
| Sport         | ice-hockey |            | badminton | cycling    |
| Transport     | skateboard | bike       | motorbike | snowmobile |

From clue 2, we know that the person watching disaster movies plays badminton. Since the person who's sport is badminton is already in position 3 (from the previous deduction), we can conclude that the person watching disaster movies must be in position 3.


Clue 4 tells us that the person watching disaster movies is on the right of the person watching superhero movies. This means that the superhero movie fan must be in either position 1 or 2. However, clue 6 says that the skateboard rider watches superhero movies, so the skateboard rider (already determined to be in position 1) can't watch superhero movies. Therefore, the superhero movie fan is in position 2.


From this, we can fill in more of the table:


|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |     4      |
| Movie-Genre   | zombie     | superhero | disaster  |            |
| Nationality   | canadian   | thai       | indonesian| indian     |
| Pet           | snake      | frog       | hedgehog  | hamster    |
| Sport         | ice-hockey | surfing    | badminton | cycling    |
| Transport     | skateboard | bike       | motorbike | snowmobile |

Now, let's consider clue 3: the person driving the bike is in an even position. Since there are only two even positions (2 and 4), we can deduce that the bike rider must be either in position 2 or 4.


However, clue 8 says that the snake owner is on the left of the bike rider, which means the bike rider cannot be in position 1 (which is occupied by the snake owner). Therefore, the bike rider is not in position 2 but rather in an even position other than 1 and 2, i.e., position 4 or another position where we already know who it belongs to (i.e. position 2 with skateboard), this can't happen as per previous deductions hence the bike rider must be in the only remaining position left for them which is position 4.


|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |     4      |
| Movie-Genre   | zombie     | superhero | disaster  | musical    |
| Nationality   | canadian   | thai       | indonesian| indian     |
| Pet           | snake      | frog       | hedgehog  | hamster    |
| Sport         | ice-hockey | surfing    | badminton | cycling    |
| Transport     | skateboard | snowmobile | motorbike | bike       |

Clue 13 says the thai is on the left of the owner of the frog. Since the thai person is in position 2, it means the owner of the frog must be in a position to their right (position 3), which isn't correct because that would leave us with two people watching musical movies or we will have disaster and superhero movie fan swapped places from what we deduced before hence this can't happen so Thai person is on left of frog's owner if it were in the other possible place i.e. position 1 as per previous deductions but according to clue 13 that cant be correct and since Thai person can only be on left or right of one person, its safe to assume that thai person has been swapped with another country which also could be Canadian hence swapping takes place between these two countries.


The final solution is:


|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |     4      |
| Movie-Genre   | zombie     | superhero | disaster  | musical    |
| Nationality   | canadian -> thai (swapped) | thai-> canadian | indonesian| indian     |
| Pet           | snake      | frog       | hedgehog  | hamster    |
| Sport         | ice-hockey | surfing    | badminton | cycling    |
| Transport     | skateboard | snowmobile | motorbike | bike       |

So final country column looks like this:


|               | thai       | canadian   | indonesian| indian     |

Hence, the final solution is

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 8, the person driving the roller is on the far left or far right. Since there are only four positions, this means they must be in position 1 or 4.
* From clue 15, the person watching musical movies is on the left or right of the person driving the roller. This suggests that the person driving the roller is likely to be in position 1, and the person watching musical movies is in position 4 (since they can't be in position 3 due to other constraints).
* From clue 7, the person driving the airplane is on the left of the person driving the car. This means that the person driving the airplane must be in position 2 or 3.
* From clue 12, the person driving the helicopter is in an odd position (1 or 3). Since they can't be in position 1 (taken by the roller), they must be in position 3.
* Clues 4 and 6 suggest that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the person who's hobby is drawing are on either side of the person drinking mirinda. This means that the person drinking mirinda must be in position 2 (since they can't be in position 1 due to other constraints).
* Clue 5 suggests that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the person eating grapes. Since the person eating grapes must be in position 1 or 4, and the person drinking mirinda is in position 2, this means that the person eating grapes must be in position 1.
* Clue 3 suggests that the person who's hobby is writing is on the right of the person eating grapefruit. Since the person eating grapefruit is also drinking cola (clue 2), and they can't be in position 1 (taken by the roller or grapes), this means that the person eating grapefruit must be in position 2.
* Clues 10 and 13 suggest that the person watching spy movies and zombie movies are on either side of the person eating radish. Since the person eating radish is also drinking water (clue 14), and they can't be in position 1 or 2 due to other constraints, this means that the person eating radish must be in position 4.
