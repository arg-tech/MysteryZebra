Lv4-1x3-1	"Let's analyze the puzzle step by step:

From statement 2, we know that Rugby is on the far right, which means it must be in position 3.

From statement 1, we know that Skateboarding is to the right of Surfing. Since Rugby is already in position 3, this means Skateboarding must be in position 2, and Surfing must be in position 1.

Finally, from statement 4, we confirm that Rugby is indeed in an odd position (position 3), which matches our previous conclusion.

Here's the final solution table:


|         |    1    |       2       |   3   |
| Sport   | Surfing | Skateboarding | Rugby |

Lv4-1x3-2	"Let's solve the puzzle.


Since the person eating cabbage is on the far left (position 1), we can start by filling that in:


|        |    1    |     2      |   3    |
| Food   | Cabbage |            |        |

Now, since the person eating carrot is in an odd position, it must be either position 1 or 3. But we already know that cabbage is in position 1, so the person eating carrot must be in position 3:


|        |    1    |     2      |   3    |
| Food   | Cabbage |            | Carrot |

The only food left to assign is watermelon. It can only go in position 2:


|        |    1    |     2      |   3    |
| Food   | Cabbage | Watermelon | Carrot |

Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:

Lv4-1x3-3	"Based on the clues:


1. The person who's hobby is drawing is in an even position
   => The person who draws must be in position 2, since it's the only even position.

2. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks
   => Since the person who draws is already determined to be in position 2, this means the person who does magic-tricks must be either in position 1 or 3.

3. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the right of the person who's hobby is drawing
   => This clue directly contradicts with the first two clues taken together, so we should reassess and take into account that all three hobbies need to be assigned.


Reevaluating:


Since there are only 3 people and 3 hobbies, one must occupy position 1. Given clue 2, magic-tricks can't be in position 1 (because drawing needs to be on the left or right of it). Hence:


Magic-tricks can't be in position 1 => Board-games is most likely in position 1

Considering all clues together:


If we put the person who draws in an even position (2), and magic-tricks has to be on its right, then drawing must be followed by magic-tricks.


This leaves board-games for position 1.


Hence the final arrangement should be:


#############
|         |      1      |    2    |      3       |
| Hobby   | Board-games | Drawing | Magic-tricks |

Lv4-1x3-4	"Based on the given clues:

From clue 1: The fan of jazz is in an odd position, which means it can only be in position 1 or 3.

From clue 2: The fan of techno is to the left of the fan of jazz. This implies that if jazz were in position 3, techno would have to be in a non-existent position 0 (which doesn't exist). Therefore, the only possibility for this condition to hold true given the first clue is that jazz must be in position 1 and techno cannot be on its left since there's no space. This leaves us with the conclusion that techno has to be immediately next to it, which means techno can't fit into any of these positions under the initial interpretation.

Reevaluating: If we reconsider the implications strictly based on given information without assuming a non-existent position for techno relative to jazz's placement:

- Jazz must be in an odd-numbered position (1 or 3).
- Techno must be to the left of jazz, but this cannot apply if jazz is in position 1 since there's no space to its left.

Correctly interpreting clue 2 within the bounds of possible positions means techno can only precede jazz if jazz isn't at the beginning. Therefore:

- Jazz being in an odd position means it must be in position 3, not 1.
- Since techno is to the left of jazz and considering our corrected understanding that jazz must be in position 3 for this condition to hold true:
  - Techno then has to be in position 2 (the only space available to its left).

This leaves country as the remaining option for position 1.

Therefore, the solution table with '#############' around it is:


|               |    1    |   2    |  3   |

Lv4-1x3-5	"Based on the given information:

* The person eating onion is in an odd position, so they can be either at position 1 or 3.
* Since the person eating papaya must be to the right of the person eating onion, and there are only three positions, the person eating onion cannot be at position 3. If they were, there would not be enough space for the person eating papaya.

Therefore, the person eating onion must be at position 1. Since the person eating papaya is to their right, the person eating papaya must be at position 2 or 3.

But since the remaining food is kiwi and it's the only one left, it can only go in the remaining spot which is the last one. Hence the order of the foods from left to right are onion, papaya, kiwi

Here is the final solution table:

#############
|        |   1   |   2    |  3   |
| Food   |Onion | Papaya | Kiwi|

Lv4-1x3-6	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 2, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is in an even position, which means it must be in either position 2.

Now, let's look at clue 1: ""the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person drinking mirinda"". This implies that the person drinking mirinda cannot be in position 1 (since there would be no one to their left), and also cannot be in the same position as the person drinking hot-chocolate. Therefore, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 3.

Now we have:

|            |  1  |       2       |    3    |
| Beverage   |     |               |         |

Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 2, and the person drinking mirinda is in position 3, the only remaining beverage (7up) must be in position 1.

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|            |  1  |       2       |    3    |
| Beverage   | 7up | hot-chocolate | Mirinda |

Lv4-1x3-7	"Let's break down the clues:

Clue 1: The engineer is to the right of the designer.
This means that the designer cannot be in column 3, since there is no one to the right of them. Also, the engineer cannot be in column 1, since they need someone to their left.

Clue 2: The engineer is in an even position.
Since there are only three columns, this means the engineer must be in either column 2 (an even number).

Putting these clues together, we can deduce that:

* The designer cannot be in column 3 and must be in column 1.
* The engineer must be in column 2.

The analyst is left to fill in the remaining spot in column 3.

Here is the final solution table:


|       |    1     |    2     |    3    |

Lv4-1x3-8	"Based on the given clues:


Since the teacher is in an odd position (1 or 3) and to the right of the paramedic, we can deduce that:


* The teacher cannot be in position 1 because then there would be no one to the left of them.
* Therefore, the teacher must be in position 3.

Given this information and clue 2 (which doesn't provide any additional useful information), we can fill out the table as follows:

Lv4-1x3-9	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person drinking iced-tea is to the right of the person drinking cola.
This means that the order must be: cola, ?, iced-tea (since iced-tea cannot be in position 2).

2. The person drinking iced-tea is in an odd position.
Since there are only 3 positions, this means that the person drinking iced-tea must be in either position 1 or 3. But from clue 1, we know that iced-tea cannot be in position 1, so it must be in position 3.

Now we can fill in the table:

#############
|            |   1   |  2   |    3     |
| Beverage   | Cola  | Fanta| Iced-Tea |

* The only remaining food is plum, which must be in position 3.
