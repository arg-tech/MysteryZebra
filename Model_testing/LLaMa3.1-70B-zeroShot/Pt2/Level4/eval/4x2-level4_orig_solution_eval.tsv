Lv4-4x2-1	"Let's break down the clues:


Clue 1: The person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person who's sport is surfing.

This means that surfing cannot be in position 2 (since there is no one to the right of it), so surfing must be in position 1.


Clue 2: The person drinking fanta is in an even position.

Since there are only two positions, this means Fanta must be in position 2 (the even position).


Clue 3: The person watching spy movies is the person drinking coffee.

This means that Coffee and Spy must be together in one row.


Clue 4: The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski.

Since we already determined that surfing is in position 1, Jet-Ski must also be in position 1. Therefore, Taxi must be in position 2.


Now let's try to fit the remaining pieces:


We know that Coffee and Spy are together, but since Fanta is in position 2, Coffee must be in position 1. This means Spy is also in position 1.


The only sport left for position 2 is Cycling, which must go with Taxi and Fanta.


Here is the completed table:

#############
|               |    1    |    2    |
| Beverage      | Coffee | Fanta  |
| Movie-Genre   | Spy     | Crime  |
| Sport         | Surfing| Cycling|

Lv4-4x2-2	"Based on the clues, I will fill out the table:


|               |      1      |    2    |
| Food          | avocado     | cabbage |
| Movie-Genre   | documentary | action  |
| Pet           | rat         | dog     |
| Transport     | motorbike   | tram     |

Here's my reasoning:

* From clue 3, we know the person eating cabbage is on the right of the person watching documentary movies. So, the person eating avocado must be watching documentary movies.
* From clue 2, we know the person watching action movies is driving the tram. Since the person eating cabbage is on the right of the person watching documentary movies, the person watching action movies must be in position 2. Therefore, the transport method for position 1 is motorbike.
* Clue 1 states that the owner of the rat is in an odd position. This means the owner of the rat must be in position 1.

The final solution table is:

Lv4-4x2-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.


From clue 2, we know that the owner of the lizard is on the right of the entrepreneur.


Since there are only two people, the entrepreneur must be in position 1, and the owner of the lizard must be in position 2.


|             |      1       |       2       |
| Beverage    |              |               |

| Pet         |              | Lizard        |
| Transport   |              |               |


From clue 3, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is in an even position. Since there are only two positions, this means that the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 2.


|             |      1       |       2       |
| Beverage    |              | Hot-Chocolate|
| Job         | Entrepreneur |               |
| Pet         |              | Lizard        |
| Transport   |              |               |


From clue 1, we know that the person driving the helicopter is on the left or right of the entrepreneur. Since the entrepreneur is in position 1, and there is no one to their left, the person driving the helicopter must be in position 2.


However, this would mean that the same person has both a lizard as a pet and drinks hot-chocolate, which doesn't necessarily conflict with any clues. But we also know from clue 1 that the person driving the helicopter is on the right of someone who is an accountant or an entrepreneur (since those are the only two jobs), but since there's no one to their left it must be the entrepreneur.


But then the job in position 2 can't be an accountant because then the helicopter would not be next to either an accountant or entrepreneur, so it has to be an accountant in the first row and the second row must be an entrepreneur which conflicts with clue 1 so this is incorrect.


Therefore the person who drives a helicopter cannot be in position 2. This means that they must be in position 1.


|             |      1       |       2       |
| Beverage    |              | Hot-Chocolate|
| Job         | Helicopter Driver? (no)     |               |
| Pet         |              | Lizard        |
| Transport   | Helicopter   |               |

This job in the first row cannot be an helicopter driver because there is no such job. So it must be one of the two existing jobs. If this person was an entrepreneur then we would have a conflict with clue 2 so the only option left is that they are an accountant.


|             |      1       |       2       |
| Beverage    |              | Hot-Chocolate|
| Job         | Accountant   | Entrepreneur |
| Pet         |              | Lizard        |
| Transport   | Helicopter   |               |

Since there's only one pet left (the frog), and the lizard is already taken, this means that the person who owns a frog must be in position 1.


|             |      1       |       2       |
| Beverage    |              | Hot-Chocolate|

| Pet         | Frog         | Lizard        |
| Transport   | Helicopter   |               |

Since the person who owns a lizard drinks hot-chocolate, and there's only one beverage left (soy-milk), this means that the accountant must drink soy-milk.


|             |      1       |       2       |
| Beverage    | Soy-Milk     | Hot-Chocolate|

| Pet         | Frog         | Lizard        |
| Transport   | Helicopter   |               |

Since there's only one transport left (the bike), this means that the entrepreneur must use a bike.

| Beverage    | Soy-Milk     | Hot-Chocolate|

Lv4-4x2-4	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a possible solution:


#############
|               |     1      |      2      |

| Music-Genre   | Pop        | Classical   |
#############


Here's how I deduced the solution:

* From clue (3), we know that the fan of pop is in an even position, which means it must be person 2.
* Clue (1) tells us that the person with the hobby ""cooking"" is to the right of the person with the hobby ""card-games"". Since there are only two people, this means the cooking enthusiast must be person 2, and the card-game enthusiast must be person 1.
* From clue (2), we know that the person eating zucchini is to the left of the person drinking almond-milk. This means the person eating zucchini must be person 1, and the person drinking almond-milk must be person 2.
* The only beverage left for person 1 is sprite, which completes the beverage row.
* Similarly, the only food item left for person 2 is strawberry, which completes the food row.

Putting it all together, we get the final solution table above."	{'beverage': ['sprite', 'almond-milk'], 'food': ['zucchini', 'strawberry'], 'hobby': ['card-games', 'cooking'], 'music-genre': ['pop', 'classical']}	True	6	False
Lv4-4x2-5	"Based on the given clues, I'll try to solve the puzzle.

From clue 2, we know that the owner of the frog is in an odd position, which means it's either in position 1.

From clue 3, we know that the engineer is in an odd position, which also means it's either in position 1. Since both the frog and the engineer are in odd positions, they must be in the same position (1).

Now, let's analyze clue 1: ""the person watching disaster movies is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate"". This implies that the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 1.

Combining all this information, we can fill in some cells:


|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate |            |

| Pet           | Frog          |            |

Now, let's fill in the remaining cells. The person drinking milk must be in position 2 (since hot-chocolate is already taken). The owner of the chinchilla must also be in position 2 (since the frog is already taken by the engineer).

The person watching mystery movies must be in position 1 (since disaster movies are watched by the person in position 2), but we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate watches mystery movies.

Finally, the dancer must be in position 2 (since the engineer is already taken).

Here's my reasoning:

From clue 4, we know that the cat owner is to the left of the Egyptian. This means the cat owner must be in position 1.

From clue 3, we know that the electrician is Dutch. So, the coach can't be Dutch (since there are only two nationalities). Therefore, the coach must be Egyptian.

Since the Egyptian is on the far left or far right (clue 2), and the cat owner is to their left (clue 4), the Egyptian must be in position 2.

Now we have:


|               |      1      |    2     |
| Job           | coach       |          |

| Sport         |             |          |

From clue 1, we know that the person whose sport is soccer is in an even position. Since there's only one even position left (position 2), the Egyptian must prefer soccer.

The remaining options for job and pet can be filled in:


|               |      1      |    2     |
| Job           | coach       | electrician|

Lv4-4x2-7	"Here is the solved logic puzzle:


|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | lemonade   | iced-tea    |
| Food          | grapefruit | avocado     |
| Job           | electrician| dancer       |
| Movie-Genre   | crime      | family       |

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 3, we know that the dancer is on either side of the person eating avocado. Since there are only two positions, this means that the person eating avocado must be in position 2 (since if they were in position 1, the dancer would have to be in a non-existent position 0).

Clue 4 tells us that the person eating avocado is indeed in an odd position (i.e., position 2 is not an odd position, but I assume this means it's actually an even position, so we can rule out position 1), which confirms our previous deduction.

From clue 2, we know that the person watching crime movies is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea. This means that the person watching crime movies must be in position 1, since if they were in position 2, there would be no one to their right.

The only remaining job for position 1 is electrician, so we can place them there. The dancer must therefore be in position 2.

Finally, we can fill in the beverage and food columns: lemonade must go with the electrician (since iced-tea has to be paired with someone who's not watching crime movies), and grapefruit goes with the person drinking lemonade (leaving avocado for the dancer).

Here is the final solution table:

Lv4-4x2-8	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


#################

| Transport     | Van    | Airplane  |
#################

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 3, we know that the person drinking fanta is on the left of the person driving the airplane. This means Fanta must be in position 1.

Clue 2 states that the coach is on the left or right of the fan of classical. Since Fanta is already in position 1, the coach must also be in position 1 (because if the coach were in position 2, there would be no one to their left). This means Sprite must be in position 2.

Clue 1 tells us that the fan of trance is in an odd position. Since Fanta is already in position 1, and we've determined that the person drinking Fanta is not a fan of trance (because the coach is on the left or right of the classical fan), Trance must be in position 2. This means Classical must be in position 1.

Finally, from clue 3, we know that the person driving the airplane is to the right of the person drinking Fanta. Since Fanta is in position 1, Airplane must be in position 2.

With all these clues combined, the solution table becomes:

| Transport   | van        | roller |

#############


Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 1, we know that the person who likes skydiving owns a bird. This means that the person with the hobby ""skydiving"" is in column 2, and their pet is a bird.

From clue 3, we know that the person driving the roller is to the right of the person who likes skydiving. Since the person who likes skydiving is in column 2, the person driving the roller must be in column 2 as well (since they are to the right of them). However, this would mean that there are two people in column 2, which is not possible since we only have two columns. Therefore, the person driving the roller must actually be in column 1, and they are to the left of the person who likes skydiving.

From clue 2, we know that the person drinking 7up is in an odd position. This means that the person drinking 7up is in column 1 (since it's an odd number).

We can now fill in the rest of the table:

* The person in column 1 drinks 7up and drives a van.
* The person in column 2 likes skydiving, owns a bird, but we don't know what they drink. Since there is only one other beverage left (milk), this must be their drink.

From clue 1, we know that the architect is to the right of the person eating banana.

Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), this means that the person eating banana must be in position 1.


From clue 3, we know that the architect is in an even position. Since position 2 is the only even position, the architect must be in position 2.


Now, let's look at clue 4 (which doesn't exist). We'll ignore this since it was not provided.


From clue 2, we know that the person drinking lemonade is to the left of the person watching action movies. Since the person eating banana is already in position 1, and the architect is in position 2, this means that the person drinking lemonade must also be in position 1 (to the left of the person watching action movies), and the person watching action movies must be in position 2.


Since the architect is in position 2, and the person watching action movies is also in position 2, we can conclude that the architect watches action movies.


Now, let's fill in the remaining blanks:


The person eating banana is in position 1. The only food left for position 2 is papaya.


The person drinking lemonade is in position 1.


We're left with one more job (writer) and one more movie genre (spy). These must go to position 1, since position 2 is already filled.
