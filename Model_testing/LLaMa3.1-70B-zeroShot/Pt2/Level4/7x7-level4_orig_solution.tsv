Here's a brief explanation of the solution process:

* I started by analyzing clues that provide direct information about positions, such as clues 3, 4, and 13.
* Next, I used clues that relate different categories to each other, like clues 5, 11, and 15, to build connections between columns.
* Clues that specify the position of a category relative to another category were particularly helpful in filling out the table, such as clues 2, 12, and 27.
* Finally, I used the remaining clues to fill in any gaps and ensure consistency across all categories.

Lv4-7x7-7	"I'll solve the puzzle step by step.

First, let's analyze the given information:

* The writer is on the far left or far right (17).
* The person driving the trike is in the middle (34).
* The person who's hobby is drawing is in the middle (6).
* The person driving the bike is on the far left or far right (1).
* The person watching epic movies is the person eating pumpkin (4).
* The person eating pineapple is on the right of the person eating onion (7).

From these clues, we can start building the table.

Since the writer is on the far left or far right, and the person who's hobby is video-games is on the far left (26), we can place them together:

|               |      1      | ... |
| Food          |             | ... |
| Hobby         | video-games | ... |
| Job           | writer      | ... |

Next, let's use clue (6) to place the person who's hobby is drawing in the middle:

|               |      1      | ... |      4      | ... |
| Food          |             | ... |              | ... |
| Hobby         | video-games | ... | drawing     | ... |

We can also use clue (34) to place the person driving the trike in the middle:

|               |      1      | ... |      3      |      4      | ... |
| Food          |             | ... | motor        |              | ... |
| Hobby         | video-games | ... | drawing     | ... |

Now, let's use clue (1) to place the person driving the bike on the far left or far right. Since the writer is already on the far left, we can place the bike driver on the far right:

|               |      1      | ... |      3      |      4      | ... |      7      |
| Food          |             | ... | motor        |              | ... |             |
| Hobby         | video-games | ... | drawing     | ... |

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

1. First, I used clues 3 and 6 to place the person eating lettuce on the far left (position 1).
2. Next, I used clues 16 and 20 to place the person watching mystery movies (lettuce eater) and the paramedic (epic movies fan) in positions 1 and 4, respectively.
3. Clues 7 and 27 helped me identify the tea drinker as the hiker, which led me to place them in position 6.
4. Using clues 10, 25, and 28, I determined that the rugby player was in position 5 (the middle).
5. From clue 14, I knew the firefighter was a reggae fan and had to be on the left or right of the soul fan (kiwi eater). Clue 17 helped me place them in positions 6 and 7.
6. With clues 9, 23, and 24, I established that the kiwi eater was the soul fan and placed them in position 7.
7. The rest of the puzzle fell into place using a combination of clues about jobs, hobbies, sports, and movie genres.
