Note: The solution table shows the correct arrangement of hobbies, jobs, movie genres, pets, sports, and transportation for each person.

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:

* I started by using the constraints to place certain individuals in specific positions or parity positions.
* Clues like ""the security-guard is on the far left or far right"" (Clue 5) helped me narrow down the possible placements.
* Other clues, such as ""the person who's hobby is board-games is somewhere between the owner of the bird and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing"" (Clue 55), allowed me to place certain individuals in relation to others.
* As I filled in more positions, I used the remaining clues to resolve any conflicts or inconsistencies.

This puzzle required careful attention to the parity constraints and the relationships between different individuals. The solution table shows a unique arrangement that satisfies all 62 clues."
