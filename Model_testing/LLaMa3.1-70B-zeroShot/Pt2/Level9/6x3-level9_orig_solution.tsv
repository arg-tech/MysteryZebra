| Nationality   | mexican  | american    | malaysian    |
| Transport     | airplane | skateboard  | trike        |

Here's the step-by-step solution:


From clue 8, we know the person eating plum is driving the airplane.
From clue 4, we know the person driving the airplane is the Mexican.


So, column 1 is filled with plum and mexican in food and nationality respectively.


From clue 7, we know the person driving the airplane is the person who's hobby is cooking.
Now column 1 has: plum - cooking - mexican


From clue 2, we know the person eating pear is not a fan of pop music.


From clue 6, we know the Malaysian is to the right of the person eating plum. This means column 3 should have malaysian in nationality.


So far:


|               |    1     |      2      |      3       |

| Transport     | airplane |             |              |

From clue 5, we know the person driving the skateboard is not to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.


Column 3 should have trike as transport (clue 3). Now column 3 has: unknown - magic-tricks? - malaysian - trike


|               |    1     |      2      |      3       |

| Transport     | airplane | skateboard? | trike        |

From clue 10, we know the fan of gospel music is in an even position.


Column 2 should have gospel as music-genre.


|               |    1     |      2      |      3       |

| Nationality   | mexican  | american?   | malaysian    |
| Transport     | airplane | skateboard? | trike        |

From clue 12, we know the person watching sports movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.


Column 2 should have woodworking as hobby and column 3 should have sports movie-genre. Now column 2 has: pineapple - woodworking - gospel


|               |    1     |      2      |      3       |

| Nationality   | mexican  | american?   | malaysian    |
| Transport     | airplane | skateboard? | trike        |

From clue 9, we know the person eating pineapple and the American have the same parity positions.


Column 2 has american in nationality. Now column 2 is completely filled: pineapple - woodworking - gospel - american


|               |    1     |      2      |      3       |

From clue 3, we know the person driving the trike is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is cooking.


Column 1 should have crime movie-genre and column 2 has romance movie-genre (clue 11).


The only remaining food is pear. Column 3 has: pear - magic-tricks - sports - malaysian - trike


From clue 5, we know the person driving the skateboard is not to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.


Column 2 should have skateboard as transport.

| Nationality   | mexican  | american    | malaysian    |
| Transport     | airplane | skateboard  | trike        |

From clue 1, we know the person watching crime movies and the fan of pop have different parity positions.


Column 3 should have metal as music-genre (clue 6 doesn't fit with this possibility).


The only remaining music-genre is pop which should be in column 2 doesn't fit because of clue 1. Column 1 has pop or vice versa. So the correct order for music-genre from left to right is: pop - gospel - metal


Now we have:


|               |    1     |      2      |      3       |

| Sport         | parkour    | biathlon   | swimming   |
| Transport     | bike       | helicopter | snowmobile |
#############


Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 2, cabbage is to the right of parkour.
From clue 9, potato is next to thai.
From clue 11, swimming is to the right of thai.

Now we have: ... - parkour - ... - thai - ... - swimming

Clue 1 says that potato and thai are in different parity positions. This means potato must be in position 2 (even).

Now we have: ... - parkour - potato - thai - ... - swimming

From clue 12, the helicopter is in an even position.
From clue 4, the helicopter is not to the left of sports movies.

This means the helicopter must be in position 2 or 6. But since it's already taken by potato, it must be in position 6. And sports movies must be in position 3.

Now we have: ... - parkour - potato - thai - ... - swimming
... - ... - ... - ... - zombie - helicopter

From clue 13, biathlon is not to the left of musical movies.
From clue 7, biathlon and cauliflower are in the same parity positions (odd).

This means biathlon must be in position 1 or 3. But since it's already taken by parkour or thai, it must be in position 1.

Now we have: biathlon - parkour - potato - thai - ... - swimming
musical - ... - zombie - ... - sports - helicopter

From clue 10, swimming is not eating cauliflower.
From clue 5, bike and techno are in different parity positions.

This means techno must be in position 2 or 6 (even). But since it's already taken by potato, it must be in position 6. And salsa must be in position 1 (with biathlon).

Now we have: biathlon - parkour - potato - thai - ... - swimming
musical - salsa - zombie - ... - techno - helicopter

From clue 3, ambient is not with snowmobile.
From clue 8, nigerian is to the left of snowmobile.

This means ambient must be in position 1 (with biathlon) or 3. But since it's already taken by salsa, it must be in position 3.

Now we have: biathlon - parkour - potato - thai - ... - swimming
musical - salsa - zombie - ambient - techno - helicopter

The only remaining person is australian, who must be with cabbage (clue 2).

Now we have:
biathlon - parkour - potato - thai - ... - swimming
musical - salsa - zombie - ambient - techno - helicopter
australian - nigerian - ... - ...

The only remaining food is cauliflower, which must be eaten by the person in position 3 (clue 7).

Now we have:
biathlon - parkour - potato - thai - ... - swimming
musical - salsa - zombie - ambient - techno - helicopter
australian - nigerian - thai - ...

The only remaining sport is swimming, which must be in position 6 (clue 11).

Now we have:

Lv9-6x3-3	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a solution for the logic puzzle. Here is the completed table:


|               |     1     |     2      |     3     |
| Food          | strawberry| cabbage    | corn       |
| Job           | coach     | mechanic   | chef       |
| Movie-Genre   | animation | drama      | fantasy    |
| Nationality   | pakistani | argentine  | indian     |
| Sport         | swimming  | handball   | volleyball |
| Transport     | car       | bus        | motorbike  |

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

From clue 2, we know that the person who's sport is volleyball (3) is to the right of the person who's sport is handball (2). From clue 10, we know that the person eating strawberry (1 or 3) is on the left or right of the person who's sport is swimming. This implies that strawberry must be at position 1.

From clue 7, we know that the pakistani is not to the left of the person eating corn. Since strawberry is already at position 1, corn must be at position 3. Cabbage, therefore, is at position 2.

Using clues 6 and 9, we can determine that the person watching animation movies (1) is the pakistani, and the person driving the bus (2) is not the one who's sport is handball.

Clue 8 states that the argentine is not to the right of the coach. This implies that the argentine must be at position 2. Clue 3 places the mechanic between the coach and the person watching fantasy movies. The coach, therefore, must be at position 1, and the mechanic at position 2.

The remaining clues help to place the other attributes:

* Fantasy movies are watched by the indian (3)
* Volleyball is played by the argentine (2), but this contradicts clue 5. Therefore, volleyball is played by the indian (3).
* Drama movies are watched by the mechanic (2), but this contradicts clue 1. Therefore, drama movies are watched by the chef (3).
* The person driving the motorbike is not the mechanic (clue 11). Therefore, it must be the pakistani.

The final solution table is:

Lv9-6x3-4	"Let's start solving the puzzle step by step.


From clue 3, the Italian is on the far left or far right.
From clue 5, the owner of the snake is on the far left or far right.

These two clues together imply that either the Italian and the owner of the snake are in positions 1 and 3 (in some order), or they occupy these two positions.


From clue 2, the person eating kale and the fan of blues have different parity positions.
This means that if one is in an odd position, the other must be in an even position.


From clue 8, the Canadian is in an even position.
This implies that either the Canadian is in position 2 or the Canadian cannot be the person eating kale (since then they would need to occupy an odd position).


From clue 4, the person watching mystery movies is somewhere between the person eating kale and the Italian.


Let's examine the possibilities for where the Italian could be:


If the Italian were on the far left:
|               |    1     |    2     |      3      |
| Beverage      |          |          |             |
| Food          |          |          |             |
| Movie-Genre   |          |          |             |
| Music-Genre   |          |          |             |
| Nationality   | Italian  |          |             |
| Pet           |          |          |             |

Then the person watching mystery movies would have to be in position 2 or 3, which means they cannot be between the person eating kale and the Italian (as required by clue 4). So this placement of the Italian is impossible.


If the Italian were on the far right:
|               |    1     |    2     |      3      |
| Beverage      |          |          |             |
| Food          |          |          |             |
| Movie-Genre   |          |          |             |
| Music-Genre   |          |          |             |
| Nationality   |          |          | Italian     |
| Pet           |          |          |             |

The person watching mystery movies must be between the person eating kale and the Italian. So they must occupy position 2.


We also know that either the owner of the snake is in position 1 or the Italian occupies this spot (if we consider the Italian to be on the far right). But since the Italian cannot occupy the leftmost position, it follows that the owner of the snake is indeed on the far left.


From clue 6, the person watching mystery movies is not to the right of the owner of the cat.
This implies that the person watching mystery movies (in position 2) must be to the left of the owner of the cat. Thus, the cat's owner cannot occupy position 1 and must occupy either position 2 or 3.


Since we know that the owner of the snake occupies position 1, it follows that the owner of the cat must occupy position 3.


From clue 7, the fan reggae is the person watching action movies.
This means that the person in position 1 (the owner of the snake) cannot watch action movies, since they also cannot be a fan of reggae. The same applies to the person in position 2 (watching mystery movies).


Hence, we can conclude that the Canadian must occupy position 2 and watch documentary movies.


We know from clue 10 that the person watching documentary movies is not to the left of the Italian.
So this fits perfectly with our deductions so far:


From clue 9, the person eating raspberry is the person watching documentary movies. Since the Canadian watches documentary movies, they must eat raspberry.


Also from clue 11, the person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person watching mystery movies. Hence, the owner of the snake drinks iced-tea (since this is the only remaining spot for someone to drink iced-tea and be to the left of the mystery movie fan).


From clue 1, the person drinking sprite is somewhere to the left of the owner of the snake.
Since we know that the owner of the cat is in position 3, this implies that the person drinking sprite must be in either position 1 or 2. But they cannot occupy position 1 since it's already taken by the owner of the snake (who drinks iced-tea). So they must be in position 2.


However, we've previously established that the Canadian watches documentary movies and eats raspberry in position 2. This contradicts our latest deduction that the person drinking sprite should also occupy this spot.


This inconsistency implies that our earlier assumption about where the Italian is located (far right) cannot hold true under these constraints. Hence, let's re-examine the placement of the Italian:


If the Italian were on the far left:
|               |    1     |    2     |      3      |
| Beverage      |          |          |             |
| Food          |          |          |             |
| Movie-Genre   |          |          |             |
| Music-Genre   |          |          |             |
| Nationality   | Italian  |          |             |
| Pet           |          |          |             |

Then we can easily resolve the above contradiction, and satisfy all other constraints.


Let's proceed to solve the rest of the puzzle:


From clue 1, the person drinking sprite is somewhere to the left of the owner of the snake.
The Italian occupies position 1 (far left), so this implies that either the person in position 2 drinks sprite or they do not drink coffee since someone on their left already does.


However, from clue 13, we know that the person watching mystery movies and the person drinking sprite have the same parity positions. This means that the person who watches mystery movies (in an even position) cannot be to the right of the owner of the snake (odd position), so they must drink coffee or occupy an odd position.


The only way to satisfy these two constraints is if the person watching mystery movies occupies an odd position and drinks coffee:


|               |    1     |    2     |      3      |
| Beverage      |          | Coffee   |             |
| Food          |          |          |             |
| Movie-Genre   |          | Mystery  |             |
| Music-Genre   |          |          |             |
| Nationality   | Italian  |          |             |
| Pet           |          | Cat      | Snake      |

Since the person drinking sprite must be to their left, they occupy position 1:


From clue 7, the fan reggae is the person watching action movies. This means that the person in position 3 (the owner of the snake) cannot watch action movies.


Hence, we can conclude that the Canadian occupies position 2 and watches mystery movies:


Now, from clue 9, the person eating raspberry is the person watching documentary movies.
Since this does not apply to the Italian or the person watching mystery movies, it follows that the owner of the snake (in position 3) eats raspberry and watches documentary movies:


From clue 12, the person eating raspberry is not to the left of the owner of the cat. So this fits perfectly with our deductions so far:


We know from clue 10 that the person watching documentary movies is not to the left of the Italian.
So this also fits perfectly with our deductions so far.


The only remaining slot for a person to watch action movies and be a fan of reggae is position 3, but this was already taken by someone who eats raspberry and watches documentaries. Hence, we must swap positions 2 and 3:


|               |    1     |    2     |      3      |
| Beverage      | Sprite   | Iced tea | Coffee     |
| Food          | Kale     | Raspberry| Pear       |
| Movie-Genre   | Action   | Documentary|Mystery     |
| Music-Genre   | Blues    | Reggae    | Jazz       |
| Nationality   | Italian  | Canadian | Polish     |
| Pet           | Snake    | Cat      | Goat      |

Now we can determine the remaining food for each person:


The Canadian eats raspberry and watches documentary movies, so the person eating kale must be in position 1 (Italian), and the person eating pear is in position 3 (Polish).


So the correct solution to the puzzle is:


|               |    1     |    2     |      3      |
| Beverage      | Sprite   | Iced tea | Coffee     |
| Food          | Kale     | Raspberry| Pear       |
| Movie-Genre   | Action   | Documentary|Mystery     |
| Music-Genre   | Blues    | Reggae    | Jazz       |
| Nationality   | Italian  | Canadian | Polish     |
| Pet           | Snake    | Cat      | Goat      |

The final answer is:


Italian (1) - Kale, Sprite, Action, Blues, Snake
Canadian (2) - Raspberry, Iced tea, Documentary, Reggae, Cat
Polish (3) - Pear, Coffee, Mystery, Jazz, Goat"

| Transport     | helicopter | taxi        | car         |

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I derived the solution:

From clue 14, we know the person who's hobby is skydiving is in the middle. Clue 6 tells us that the person who's hobby is cooking eats cucumber, so they must be in position 3. Clue 2 says the british is not to the left of the person who's hobby is cooking, so the british must be in position 3.

Clue 11 states that the person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person drinking 7up. Since the person drinking almond-milk watches action movies (clue 4), they must be in position 2 or 3. But if they were in position 3, then the british would be to their left, which contradicts clue 2. Therefore, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 2.

Clue 8 says that the person driving the car is on the right of the person driving the helicopter. Clue 7 states that the person eating cherry is not to the right of the person driving the helicopter, so the person driving the helicopter must be in position 1.

Now we can start filling in the remaining gaps. Clue 12 says that the person eating broccoli is on the left of the person eating cherry, so they must be in positions 1 and 2 respectively. Clue 3 states that the person watching family movies is not to the right of the person driving the helicopter, so they must be in position 2.

Clue 9 says that the person watching sports movies and the person driving the taxi have the same parity positions. Since there are only two possible positions for these individuals (1 and 3), they must both be in odd-numbered positions or both in even-numbered positions. But if the person driving the taxi were in position 2, then the person drinking cola would be to their left, which contradicts clue 5. Therefore, the person watching sports movies must be in position 1 and the person driving the taxi must be in position 3.

Finally, we can fill in the remaining gaps using clues 10 and 13. The mexican must be in an odd-numbered position (clue 10), so they must be in position 2. The person watching family movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is traveling (clue 13), so they must be in positions 2 and 1 respectively.

I hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
Lv9-6x3-6	"After solving the logic puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


|               |    1     |     2     |      3      |
| Beverage      | sprite   | lemonade | cola        |
| Food          | carrot   | asparagus| pumpkin     |
| Hobby         | skydiving| cooking  | writing     |
| Job           | coach    | lawyer   | firefighter |
| Music-Genre   | metal    | classical| techno      |
| Transport     | scooter  | subway   | quad-bike   |


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 4, the person driving the subway is the writer.
* From clue 9, the fan of techno and the person eating asparagus are on either side of the writer (subway).
* From clue 12, the person eating carrot is to the left of the writer (subway), so they must be in position 1 or 2. But from clue 11, the fan of metal and the person eating carrot have the same parity positions, which means carrot can't be in position 2 (even number). So, carrot is in position 1.
* From clue 3, the lawyer and classical music fan are in odd-numbered positions. Since classical music fan isn't to the left of the lawyer (clue 5), they must be in positions 1 and 3, respectively. But since metal and carrot have the same parity (odd or even) positions, and carrot is already in position 1, metal must be in position 3.
* From clue 6, lemonade isn't to the left of scooter. So, lemonade must be in position 2 or 3. Since cola is the only remaining beverage, it must be in position 3 (with metal).
* The person driving the scooter is somewhere to the left of pumpkin (clue 1), so scooter can't be in position 3. Thus, scooter is in position 1 or 2.
* From clue 10, scooter is on the left of subway, which means scooter must be in position 1 or 2.
* Putting all these pieces together leads to the final solution above.


Please note that I've surrounded the final table with '#############' as requested:

Lv9-6x3-7	"Here is the solved puzzle:


|               |      1      |     2     |      3      |
| Beverage      | Fanta       | Juice     | Almond-Milk |

| Transport     | Airplane    | Subway    | Tram        |

 
Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

* From clues 7 and 6, we know that the Polish person is singing and in an odd position. This means they must be in either position 1 or 3.
* However, from clue 5, we know that the Polish person is to the left of the person drinking juice. So, the Polish person must be in position 2 (singing).
* From clue 10, the person driving the airplane is on the left of the person watching drama movies. This means they must be in either position 1 or 2.
* However, from clue 4, we know that the person driving the subway is in an even position (2). So, the person driving the airplane must be in position 1.
* From clue 14, the person who's hobby is board-games is on the far left or far right. Since the Polish person is singing in position 2, the person with the board-games hobby must be in position 1 ( Thai).
* The rest of the solution falls into place from these initial deductions.

Lv9-6x3-8	"Here is the solved puzzle:


|               |     1     |      2      |    3     |
| Beverage      |  cola     |   soy-milk  | iced-tea |

| Nationality   | turkish    | indian       | german    |
| Transport     | taxi       | skateboard  | quad-bike |

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

From clue 5, we know that the person driving the taxi is on either the far left or far right. Since there are only three positions, this means they must be in position 1 or 3.

From clue 10, we know that the electrician and the taxi driver have different parity positions, meaning one is odd (position 1) and the other is even (positions 2). Therefore, if the taxi driver is in position 1, the electrician must be in either position 2 or not exist (since there's only three people), which would violate other clues. Hence, the taxi driver is in position 3.

From clue 6, we know that the fan of soul music is in the middle (position 2). This helps narrow down the possible positions for some of the other clues.

Now, from clue 7, we can deduce that the person drinking soy-milk must be to the right of the german. Since the taxi driver is already occupying position 3 and they cannot be german (by process of elimination), this means that the german person must be in either position 1 or not exist.

However, from clue 11, we know that the german person has different parity positions with the sudoku person. Given the current constraints on the board, if german was in position 2, then there's no valid place left for sudoku. Therefore, the german person is in position 1.

Since the taxi driver cannot be driving a quad-bike (clue 9), they must be in position 3. Using clues 8 and 2 together helps figure out the order of transport types: since skateboard can't be to the left of singing, skateboard must be either after or equal to the person who sings.

Now that we know some transport information and using clue 4 (soy-milk not to the left of writer) we see cola must go with electrician. This means skateboard must also be paired with either writing or analysis; which also gives us the remaining job information.



Using all these clues, the rest of the information starts falling in place: from position, transport type, beverage type and musical genre, everything else follows logically.

This is the final solution table:

Lv9-6x3-9	"After analyzing the clues, I've arrived at the following solution:


|               |       1       |    2     |     3     |
| Beverage      | juice         | mirinda  | tea        |
| Job           | dancer        | librarian| dressmaker|
| Music-Genre   | country       | salsa    | jazz       |

| Sport         | badminton     | baseball | skateboarding|
| Transport     | jet-ski       | bike     | train      |

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* From clue 4, we know the Italian is the librarian.
* Clue 9 tells us the Italian (librarian) is on the right of the fan of country music. Since the Italian can't be in position 1 (clue 12), they must be in position 2, and the fan of country music must be in position 1.
* Clue 5 indicates that the person drinking mirinda has the same parity positions as the fan of country music. Therefore, mirinda must be in an odd-numbered position (1 or 3). But clue 2 states that the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person drinking mirinda, so mirinda can't be in position 1. Hence, mirinda is in position 3.
* Clue 8 tells us the person drinking tea is not to the left of the Thai. This means tea must be in a later position than the Thai.
* From clue 10, we know the person drinking tea is on the right of the French. Since the French can't be in position 1 (clue 1), and tea can't be in position 1 or 2 (because of the Thai), tea must be in position 3, and the French must be in position 2.
* But wait! We already know mirinda is in position 3. So, we need to swap the positions of mirinda and tea. Mirinda goes to position 2, and tea goes to position 1 doesn't work because of clue 8, so tea must go to position 3, and something else needs to be moved. 
* Since bike is on the right of dancer (clue 3), we know that dancer can't be in position 3.
* The person who's sport is baseball is between badminton and train (clue 7). Badminton must be before train because jet-ski can't have baseball as a sport. Jet-ski can't be last or the french wouldn't be to the left of tea.
* From clue 6, we know dressmaker and skateboarding have the same parity positions, which means they are both in even- or odd-numbered positions. Dressmaker is most likely the third job since dancer has bike on its right, but it could also fit the second spot, however if that's true then salsa would be first and tea cannot have salsa as its music (clue 11). So dressmaker must be third which means skateboarding is the odd number one.
* With all these constraints in mind, we can deduce the final arrangement of jobs, beverages, music-genres, nationalities, sports, and transports.
