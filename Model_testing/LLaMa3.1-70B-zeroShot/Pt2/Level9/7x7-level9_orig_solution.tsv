Please note that some columns were rearranged to better fit the format.


#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:

* First, I identified the constraints on each column (e.g., ""Person driving bus is on far right"" or ""Russian is between person who's hobby is reading and Egyptian"").
* Then, I analyzed the relationships between columns using clues like ""X is to the left/right of Y"" or ""X is not to the left/right of Y"".
* Next, I used these relationships to build a network of constraints and gradually narrowed down the possibilities for each column.
* Once I had a good idea of the overall structure, I started filling in specific values based on the remaining clues.

Feel free to ask if you'd like me to elaborate on any particular step or clue!"
