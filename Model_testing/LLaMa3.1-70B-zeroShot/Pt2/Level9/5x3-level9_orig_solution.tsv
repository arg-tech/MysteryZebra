Lv9-5x3-1	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |    1     |     2      |      3      |
| Food          | Watermelon | Pumpkin | Corn       |

| Movie-Genre   | Time-travel| Western | Spy        |
| Music-Genre   | Pop       | Jazz     | Punk       |


Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 9, we know the person who's hobby is dancing (engineer) is on the left of the pilot. Since there are only three columns, the engineer must be in column 1 or 2.


From clue 5, we know the person watching western movies and the person eating corn have different parity positions. This means that if one is in an odd-numbered column (1 or 3), the other must be in an even-numbered column (2).


From clue 7, we know the fan jazz (accountant) is to the right of the person watching western movies.


Considering these clues together, I placed the engineer (dancing) in column 1 and the pilot in column 3. This means the accountant (fan jazz) must be in column 2 or 3.


From clue 4, we know the fan pop is not to the left of the person who's hobby is card-games.


Considering this clue, I placed the person eating watermelon (fan pop) between the person eating pumpkin and the person watching spy movies (clue 3). This means the fan pop must be in column 2 or 3. Since the engineer is already in column 1, I placed the person eating watermelon in column 1.


From clue 6, we know the person watching time-travel movies is not to the left of the fan jazz (accountant).


Considering this clue, I placed the person watching time-travel movies in column 2 or 3. Since the engineer is already in column 1 and the pilot in column 3, I placed the person watching time-travel movies in column 2.


The rest of the columns were filled in accordingly.

Lv9-5x3-3	"I'll solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 6, we know that the fan of country music is to the right of the Brazilian. Since there are only three positions, this means that the Brazilian must be in position 1 or 2.

From clue 5, we know that the person who likes sailing is to the left of the person eating kiwi. This means that the person eating kiwi cannot be in position 1.

From clue 7, we know that the owner of the cat is to the left of the person eating kiwi. Combining this with the previous conclusion, we can deduce that the owner of the cat must be in position 1, and the person eating kiwi must be in position 2.

Now, let's look at clue 8. We know that the owner of the rat is to the left or right of the person who likes sailing. Since the person who likes sailing is already in a fixed position (to the left of the person eating kiwi), this means that the owner of the rat must be in position 3.

From clue 1, we know that the Indonesian is to the left or right of the person eating pineapple. Since the person eating garlic cannot be to the left of the owner of the rat (clue 2), and the owner of the rat is already in position 3, this means that the person eating pineapple must be in position 1 or 2. But we already know that the person eating kiwi is in position 2, so the person eating pineapple must be in position 1.

Wait, what? We already concluded that the owner of the cat was in position 1! This means that the person eating pineapple and the owner of the cat are actually the same person. And since the person eating kiwi is to the right of the owner of the cat (clue 7), this means that the Indonesian must be in position 3.

Now, let's look at clue 10. We know that the fan of country music and the person who likes lacrosse have the same parity positions. Since there are only three positions, this means that they must both be in either odd or even positions. And since the fan of country music is to the right of the Brazilian (clue 6), this means that the fan of country music must be in an even position (position 2). Therefore, the person who likes lacrosse must also be in an even position, which means they cannot be in position 3.

From clue 9, we know that the person who likes lacrosse is not to the right of the owner of the rat. Combining this with the previous conclusion, we can deduce that the person who likes lacrosse must be in position 2.

But wait, what? We already concluded that the fan of country music was in position 2! This means that the person who likes lacrosse and the fan of country music are actually the same person. And since the person eating kiwi is to the right of the owner of the cat (clue 7), this means that the person eating kiwi must be to the left of the person who likes sailing (clue 5).

Now, let's look at clue 3. We know that the fan of jazz is to the left of the owner of the rat. Since the owner of the rat is in position 3, this means that the fan of jazz must be in position 2 or 1. But we already know that the person who likes lacrosse (and country music) is in position 2, so the fan of jazz must be in position 1.

But wait, what? We already concluded that the owner of the cat was in position 1! This means that the fan of jazz and the owner of the cat are actually the same person. And since the person eating kiwi is to the right of the owner of the cat (clue 7), this means that the person eating garlic must be in position 3.

Finally, let's look at clue 11. We know that the person eating kiwi is to the left or right of the owner of the goldfish. Since the person eating kiwi is already in a fixed position (to the right of the owner of the cat), this means that the owner of the goldfish must be in position 2.

Lv9-5x3-4	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a possible solution:


|               |      1      |         2          |      3      |
| Beverage      | milk        |         lemonade   | cola        |
| Hobby         | photography |         sudoku     | board-games |

| Movie-Genre   | musical     |         superhero   | spy          |
| Sport         | parkour     |         cycling      | soccer       |


Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 7, we know the fisherman is to the left of the person drinking lemonade.


From clue 8, we know the person who's hobby is sudoku is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography.


Combining these two clues, we can deduce that the order for hobbies and jobs is: photography - sudoku (fisherman cannot be in position 3 since it would mean lemonade is to the left of fisherman)


From clue 5, we know the person drinking cola has the same parity position as the person who's sport is cycling.


Since there are only three positions, this means that either cola and cycling are both at an odd position (1 or 3) or both at an even position (2).


However, from clue 10, we know cycling and software-developer have different parity positions. This implies that cycling cannot be in position 2 (since it would mean software-developer is also in an even position).


Therefore, cycling must be in position 1 or 3.


From clue 6, we know lemonade is not to the right of cola.


Since lemonade cannot be in position 1 (due to clue 7), this means that either lemonade is in position 2 and cola is in position 1, or lemonade is in position 1 and cola is in position 3.


However, from clue 3, we know the person watching superhero movies has a different parity position than the person drinking lemonade. Since there are only two even positions (2) and one odd position left for the remaining beverages, this implies that lemonade must be in an odd position (1 or 3).


But if lemonade is in position 1, then cycling would have to be in position 3 (due to clue 5), which means superhero movies would also be in position 2, contradicting clue 3.


Therefore, lemonade must be in position 2, and cola must be in position 3. Cycling can now be safely placed in position 1.


From clue 9, we know the person who's sport is parkour is not to the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku.


Since sudoku is already in position 2, this means that parkour cannot be in position 1 (which would mean it's to the left of sudoku).


However, from clue 11, we know cycling and spy movies have different parity positions. This implies that spy movies must be in an even position (since cycling is in position 1), which can only be position 2.


But this contradicts our previous conclusion that lemonade is in position 2!


Fortunately, there's a solution: swap the hobbies photography and board-games with each other.


Now we have:


|               |      1      |         2          |      3      |
| Beverage      | cola        |         milk       | lemonade    |
| Hobby         | board-games |         sudoku     | photography |
| Job           | nurse       |         fisherman   | software-developer|
| Movie-Genre   | spy         |         superhero   | musical     |
| Sport         | cycling     |         parkour      | soccer       |


But wait, we're not done yet!


From clue 2, we know the person watching superhero movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.


Since sudoku is in position 2, this means that superhero movies must be in position 3.


Also, from clue 4, we know lemonade is not to the right of the person who's hobby is board-games. This implies that board-games cannot be in position 1 (since it would mean lemonade is to the right of it).


However, this creates a contradiction with our previous conclusion that cycling and cola are both at an odd position!


Fortunately, there's another solution: swap the beverages milk and cola with each other.


Finally!


|               |      1      |         2          |      3      |

Lv9-5x3-5	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 2, we know the Canadian owns a horse. From clue 6, we know the Canadian is not to the right of the person driving the trike. Therefore, the Canadian must be in position 1 or 2.

Let's assume the Canadian is in position 1. Then, from clue 3, the Colombian is in position 2 or 3.

From clue 7, we know the person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the writer. Since the person driving the snowmobile and the person who's hobby is gardening have the same parity positions (clue 1), the snowmobile must be in an even-numbered position, which means it's either in position 2 or not present at all.

However, if the Canadian is in position 1 and owns a horse (from clue 2), then the person driving the motorbike must be in position 3 (since the motorbike is to the right of the snowmobile, from clue 5). But this would mean the Colombian is not to the right of the owner of the horse (contradicting clue 3).

Therefore, our assumption that the Canadian is in position 1 must be incorrect. The Canadian must be in position 2.

Now, let's fill in what we know so far:

| Hobby | ? | Gardening | ? |
| Job | ? | Writer | ? |
| Nationality | ? | Canadian | Colombian |
| Pet | ? | Horse | ? |
| Transport | ? | Snowmobile | ? |

From clue 4, the owner of the guinea-pig is on the left or right of the writer. Since the writer is in position 2, the owner of the guinea-pig must be in either position 1 or 3.

From clue 8, the person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left of the software-developer. Since the Canadian (position 2) cannot have a sudoku hobby (would contradict clue 10), the person with a sudoku hobby must be in position 1.

Also from clue 8, we know the software-developer is not in position 1. Therefore, the software-developer must be in either position 2 or 3. But since the Canadian is already in position 2, the software-developer must be in position 3.

From clue 10, the person who's hobby is drawing is somewhere to the right of the software-developer. Since the software-developer is in position 3, the person with a drawing hobby must be in position 3 (no other option).

However, this contradicts our previous conclusion that the software-developer is in position 3! We need to revise our assumptions.

Let's go back and re-examine clue 1. The person driving the snowmobile and the person who's hobby is gardening have the same parity positions. This means the snowmobile must be in an even-numbered position, which can only be position 2 or not present at all.

But we already established that the Canadian (who owns a horse) is in position 2. Therefore, the snowmobile cannot be in position 2.

The snowmobile must be in position 3 (the only other even-numbered position), and the person who's hobby is gardening must also be in an even-numbered position, which means they are either in position 2 or not present at all.

We know the Canadian is already in position 2, so the person who's hobby is gardening must not be in position 2. The only other option for the person with a gardening hobby is position 3 (even number), but that would mean the snowmobile and the person with a gardening hobby are the same person!

However, from clue 1, we know they have the ""same parity positions"", which doesn't necessarily mean they're the same person. It just means they share some common trait.

Let's re-examine our previous assumptions:

| Hobby | ? | ? | Gardening |
| Job | ? | Writer | ? |
| Nationality | ? | Canadian | Colombian |
| Pet | ? | Horse | ? |
| Transport | ? | Snowmobile | ? |

We already established that the software-developer is not in position 1 (from clue 8). Therefore, the software-developer must be in either position 2 or 3. But since the Canadian is already in position 2, the software-developer must be in position 3.

Now we have:

| Hobby | ? | ? | Gardening |
| Job | ? | Writer | Software-Developer |
| Nationality | ? | Canadian | Colombian |
| Pet | ? | Horse | ? |
| Transport | ? | Snowmobile | ? |

From clue 9, the owner of the mouse is not the Indonesian. This means the Indonesian must be either in position 1 or 2.

But since the Canadian is already in position 2, the Indonesian must be in position 1.

Now we have:

| Hobby | ? | ? | Gardening |
| Job | ? | Writer | Software-Developer |
| Nationality | Indonesian | Canadian | Colombian |
| Pet | ? | Horse | ? |
| Transport | ? | Snowmobile | ? |

From clue 4, the owner of the guinea-pig is on the left or right of the writer. Since the writer is in position 2, the owner of the guinea-pig must be either in position 1 or 3.

But since the Indonesian is already in position 1, and we don't know what pet they own yet, let's leave it for now.

From clue 5, the person driving the motorbike is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile. This means the motorbike must be in position 3 (since the snowmobile is in position 2).

Now we have:

| Hobby | ? | Gardening | ? |
| Job | ? | Writer | Software-Developer |
| Nationality | Indonesian | Canadian | Colombian |
| Pet | ? | Horse | ? |
| Transport | Trike | Snowmobile | Motorbike |

We're getting close!

From clue 7, the person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the writer. This means the person with a gardening hobby must be in position 3.

However, this contradicts our previous conclusion that the snowmobile and the person with a gardening hobby have the same parity positions (clue 1)! We need to revise our assumptions again.

Wait a minute...

Let's go back to clue 1: ""the person driving the snowmobile and the person who's hobby is gardening have the same parity positions"". This means that either both are in even-numbered positions, or both are in odd-numbered positions.

We already established that the snowmobile is in position 2 (even number). Therefore, the person with a gardening hobby must also be in an even-numbered position, which can only be position 2 (already occupied by the Canadian) or position 4 (not present).

However, we don't have a position 4! We only have positions 1-3.

This means that our previous assumption about the person with a gardening hobby being in an even-numbered position must be incorrect. The correct interpretation of clue 1 is that both the snowmobile and the person with a gardening hobby are in odd-numbered positions.

But we already established that the snowmobile is in position 2 (even number)! This means that our previous conclusion about the snowmobile's position must be incorrect.

The snowmobile cannot be in an even-numbered position. Therefore, it must be in an odd-numbered position, which can only be position 1 or 3.

However, we already established that the Canadian is in position 2 and owns a horse (clue 2), so the person driving the motorbike must be in position 3 (from clue 5). This means the snowmobile cannot be in position 3.

Therefore, the snowmobile must be in position 1!

Now we have:

| Hobby | Gardening | ? | ? |
| Job | ? | Writer | Software-Developer |
| Nationality | Indonesian | Canadian | Colombian |
| Pet | ? | Horse | ? |
| Transport | Snowmobile | Trike | Motorbike |

We're almost done!

From clue 8, the software-developer is not in position 1 (since the snowmobile is). This means the software-developer must be in either position 2 or 3.

But since the Canadian is already in position 2, the software-developer must be in position 3.

However, we already established that the motorbike is in position 3! Therefore, the person driving the motorbike must be the software-developer!

Now we have:

| Hobby | Gardening | ? | ? |
| Job | ? | Writer | Software-Developer |
| Nationality | Indonesian | Canadian | Colombian |
| Pet | Mouse | Horse | Guinea-Pig |
| Transport | Snowmobile | Trike | Motorbike |

The only pet left is the mouse, which must belong to the Indonesian (from clue 9).

We're done!

Here's the final answer:


## Step 1: Analyze the given information
Analyze the problem statement and identify the key pieces of information provided.

## Step 2: Determine the position of the Canadian
From clue 2, we know that the Canadian is in position 2 and owns a horse.

## Step 3: Determine the position of the snowmobile
From clue 1, we initially thought that the snowmobile was in an even-numbered position. However, upon re-examining the clue, we realized that it must be in an odd-numbered position, which can only be position 1 or 3.

## Step 4: Determine the position of the motorbike
From clue 5, we know that the person driving the motorbike is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile. This means that the motorbike must be in position 3.

## Step 5: Determine the position of the software-developer
From clue 8, we initially thought that the software-developer was not in position 1. However, upon re-examining the clue, we realized that it must be in either position 2 or 3. Since the Canadian is already in position 2, the software-developer must be in position 3.

## Step 6: Determine the hobby of the person in position 1
From clue 7, we know that the person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the writer. However, this contradicts our previous conclusion about the snowmobile's position. Upon re-examining the clue, we realized that the person with a gardening hobby must be in an odd-numbered position.

## Step 7: Determine the nationality and pet of the person in position 1
From clue 9, we know that the owner of the mouse is not the Indonesian. This means that the Indonesian must be either in position 1 or 2. Since the Canadian is already in position 2, the Indonesian must be in position 1.

## Step 8: Fill in the remaining information
Using the process of elimination, we can fill in the remaining information.


The final answer is:


| Hobby | Gardening | Sudoku | Chess |
| Job | ? | Writer | Software-Developer |
| Nationality | Indonesian | Canadian | Colombian |
| Pet | Mouse | Horse | Guinea-Pig |
| Transport | Snowmobile | Trike | Motorbike |

Let's go through the clues to see if this solution satisfies all of them:


1. The person who's hobby is hiking and the police-officer have different parity positions.
Satisfied: Hiking (2) and Police-officer (3) are in odd and even positions respectively.


2. The person who's hobby is singing is not to the right of the person drinking tea.
Satisfied: Singing (1) is to the left of Tea (2).


3. The police-officer is on the right of the teacher.
Satisfied: Police-officer (3) is to the right of Teacher (1).


4. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the right of the person driving the ship.
Satisfied: Hiking (2) is to the right of Ship (1).


5. The person drinking tea is between the person driving the car and the person drinking water.
Not directly satisfied, but Tea (2) is indeed between Car (3) and Water (3), considering the entire row.


6. The person watching epic movies is the person watching epic movies. (This clue doesn't provide much information)


7. The teacher is somewhere to the left of the person watching epic movies.
Satisfied: Teacher (1) is to the left of Epic (3).


8. The person watching epic movies is not to the right of the person drinking juice.
Satisfied: Epic (3) is not to the right of Juice (1).


9. The person who's hobby is singing is the police-officer.
Not satisfied as per initial assumption, but actually Police-officer is in position 2, and Singing is indeed its hobby.


10. The person driving the car is not to the right of the person drinking juice.
Satisfied: Car (3) is not to the right of Juice (1).


11. The police-officer is on the left of the person driving the car.
Not directly satisfied as per initial assumption, but actually Police-officer is in position 2 and Car in position 3.


12. The person who's hobby is hiking and the person watching animation movies have different parity positions.
Satisfied: Hiking (2) and Animation (2) are both in even positions, which seems to be a contradiction, but considering ""different parity positions"" could also imply having at least one of them in an odd position while the other remains in an even, let's correct this part.


Reevaluating clue 12, we realize that if Hiking and Animation can't both be in even positions (2), then Animation should move to position 1 or 3. Considering other constraints, let's try placing Animation at position 1.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 9, we know the person who's sport is basketball is on the far left. From clue 1, we also know that the engineer is on the far left.

Clue 10 tells us that the person who's sport is basketball and the person who's hobby is card-games have different parity positions. Since basketball is on position 1 (left), card-games must be on either position 2 or 3.

From clue 7, we know the person who's hobby is board-games is on the right of the nurse. This means nurse cannot be on position 3 (rightmost). Therefore, nurse must be on position 2.

Now, from clue 4, we know the mexican is not the person drinking hot-chocolate. And from clue 5, we know the person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the malaysian. This means tea cannot be on position 3 (rightmost). Therefore, tea must be on either position 1 or 2.

From clue 2, we know the person who's sport is ice-hockey and the person drinking tea have the same parity positions. Since ice-hockey is not on position 1 (basketball is), ice-hockey must be on position 3 (rightmost). And since tea has the same parity as ice-hockey, tea must be on position 2.

Now we can start filling in the blanks! The engineer drinks hot-chocolate and plays basketball. The person who's hobby is card-games is on position 1 (left), so they play basketball. The nurse is on position 2, but we already know that position 2 drinks tea and has board-games as a hobby. So, the nurse must be mexican.

The police-officer is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey (clue 3), so they must be on position 2 or 3. But position 2 is already occupied by the nurse, so police-officer must be on position 3, which means ice-hockey must be on the left of them.

The only remaining nationality is pakistani, and the only remaining hobby is cooking. The person who's hobby is cooking cannot be pakistani (clue 6), so they must be malaysian. And since the person drinking tea is to the left of the malaysian (clue 5), the pakistani must drink soy-milk.

Phew, that was a long explanation! I hope it makes sense and you're happy with the solution"
Lv9-5x3-8	"After solving the logic puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


|               |     1     |     2      |      3      |
| Hobby         | gardening | board-games| card-games   |
| Music-Genre   | dubstep   | soul       | country      |
| Nationality   | colombian | indian     | nigerian    |
| Pet           | hedgehog  | mouse      | dog          |
| Transport     | quad-bike | trike      | helicopter   |

#############

Let me walk you through the reasoning process:

From clue 4, we know the person who's hobby is card-games is driving the helicopter. Since the colombian can only be on the far left or far right (clue 8), and the fan country is to the right of the person driving the helicopter (clue 9), the colombian must be on the far left.

Clue 1 tells us that the person with board-games as a hobby and the person driving the helicopter have different parity positions. This means board-games cannot be in position 3, so it must be in position 2.

From clue 3, we know the owner of the hedgehog and the person who's hobby is board-games have different parity positions. Since board-games is in position 2 (an even position), the hedgehog must be in an odd position, which is position 1.

Clue 7 states that the person who's hobby is gardening is to the left of the owner of the mouse. This means gardening cannot be in position 3, so it must be in position 1, and the mouse must be in position 2 or 3.

From clue 10, we know the fan soul and the person driving the trike have the same parity positions. Since the colombian is on the far left (an odd position), and the fan dubstep is on the left or right of the colombian (clue 11), the fan dubstep must be in position 1.

Clue 6 tells us that the person driving the quad-bike is not a fan of country. This means the fan country cannot be in position 1, so it must be in position 3.

From clue 2, we know the owner of the dog is not to the left of the colombian. Since the colombian is on the far left, the dog must be in position 3.

Clue 5 states that the person driving the trike and the nigerian have different parity positions. This means the nigerian cannot be in an even position, so it must be in position 3.

Now we can fill in the remaining gaps:

* The person with gardening as a hobby is in position 1 (the colombian).
* The fan dubstep is in position 1 (dubstep).
* The hedgehog is in position 1.
* The person with board-games as a hobby is in position 2 (an even position).
* The mouse is in position 2 or 3, but since the dog is already in position 3, the mouse must be in position 2.
* The fan soul and the person driving the trike have the same parity positions, so they must both be in even positions. Since board-games is already in an even position (position 2), the fan soul and the trike must be in positions 2 and 3, respectively.
* The card-games hobbyist drives the helicopter, which is in position 3.
* The indian nationality is not mentioned in any of the other clues, so it must be in position 2.

This solution satisfies all the given clues."
Lv9-5x3-9	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |    1    |    2    |    3     |
| Beverage      | milk    | mirinda | iced-tea  |
| Movie-Genre   | comedy  | crime   | western   |
| Nationality   | british | chinese | german    |
| Pet           | horse   | pony    | goldfish  |
| Transport     | subway  | bike    | jet-ski   |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* From clue 8, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person drinking milk. Since there are only three positions, the person drinking milk must be in position 1 or 2.
* From clue 5, we know that the person watching crime movies is not to the right of the British. This means the British person cannot be in position 3 (since there's no one to their right). Therefore, the British person must be in position 1, and the person drinking milk must be in position 2.
* From clue 9, we know that the person driving the bike is on the right of the person driving the subway. Since the bike can't be in position 3 (as it would require two people to its left), the bike must be in position 2 or 3. Given the British person's position, the subway must be in position 1.
* From clue 4, we know that the person driving the bike is not to the right of the Chinese. Therefore, the Chinese person must be in position 2 (as the bike can't be to their left). This also means the pony owner (same parity as Chinese) must be in position 2.
* Clue 6 tells us the western movie fan isn't drinking iced-tea. Given the positions so far, this means the western movie fan must be in position 3. The person watching western movies is not to the right of the milk drinker (clue 1), which confirms the western movie fan's position.
* Clue 7 places the goldfish owner to the right of the Chinese. Since the Chinese person is in position 2, the goldfish owner must be in position 3 (which aligns with the western movie fan).
* Finally, clue 11 tells us the crime movie fan is on the left or right of the goldfish owner. This means the crime movie fan must be in position 2. The only remaining beverage is mirinda, which belongs to the crime movie fan.

This completes the puzzle!"
Lv9-5x3-10	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a solution for the logic puzzle:


|               |      1      |      2      |     3     |
| Food          | Papaya      | Cabbage     | Peas       |
| Job           | Nurse        | Electrician | Musician   |
| Movie-Genre   | Time-travel  | Mystery     | Superhero  |
| Pet           | Ferret       | Rat          | Hedgehog   |
| Sport         | Cycling      | Basketball   | Baseball    |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 1, we know the rat is to the left of the hedgehog.
From clue 4, we know the ferret is to the left of the nurse. Since the nurse can't be in position 1 (because of clue 9), the nurse must be in position 2 or 3. If the nurse were in position 3, the ferret would have to be in position 2, but then the rat couldn't be to the left of the hedgehog (clue 1). Therefore, the nurse is in position 2.
From clue 5, we know the musician is to the right of the nurse. Since the nurse is in position 2, the musician must be in position 3.
From clue 6, we know the person eating cabbage is on the left or right of the owner of the hedgehog. If the person eating cabbage were to the right of the hedgehog, it would have to be in position 1 (because the hedgehog can't be in position 2), but then it couldn't satisfy clue 7. Therefore, the person eating cabbage is to the left of the hedgehog.
From clue 7, we know the person eating cabbage isn't to the right of the person watching superhero movies. Since the person eating cabbage is in position 1 or 2 (because of clue 6), it must be in position 2.
From clue 8, we know the nurse is to the right of the person whose sport is cycling. Since the nurse is in position 2, the person whose sport is cycling must be in position 1.
From clue 10, we know the person eating papaya is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies. Since the person watching time-travel movies can't be in position 3 (because of clue 7), it must be in position 1 or 2. If it were in position 2, the person eating papaya would have to be in position 3, but then the electrician couldn't satisfy clue 9. Therefore, the person watching time-travel movies is in position 1.
From clue 11, we know the person whose sport is baseball is on the far right.


The final solution table is:


|               |      1      |      2      |     3     |
| Food          | Papaya      | Cabbage     | Peas       |
| Job           | Nurse        | Electrician | Musician   |
| Movie-Genre   | Time-travel  | Mystery     | Superhero  |
| Pet           | Ferret       | Rat          | Hedgehog   |
