Lv9-3x2-1	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 1, we know that the person driving the roller is on the right of the Malaysian.

From clue 2, we know that the person driving the jet-ski and the person watching epic movies have the same parity positions (i.e., both are in column 1 or both are in column 2).

Since there are only two movie genres, one must be in column 1 and the other in column 2. Suppose epic is in column 1; then, by clue 2, jet-ski must also be in column 1.

Now we can start filling in the table:


|               |     1     |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic    |            |
| Nationality   |           | Malaysian|
| Transport     | Jet-Ski | Roller    |

Since superhero is not in column 1, it must be in column 2. Similarly, Australian is not in column 2, so it must be in column 1.

Here's the final solution:


#############
|               |     1     |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic    | Superhero|
| Nationality   | Australian| Malaysian|

Lv9-3x2-2	"Based on the given clues, we can solve the puzzle as follows:


From clue 3, the person watching martial-arts movies is on the far left, so we can fill in the first column:

|               |       1       |    2    |
| Beverage      |               |         |
| Movie-Genre   | Martial-Arts |         |
| Pet           |               |         |

From clue 1, the owner of the dog and the person watching martial-arts movies have the same parity positions. Since martial-arts is on position 1 (odd), the dog must also be on an odd position, which means it's on position 1.

|               |       1       |    2    |
| Beverage      |               |         |
| Movie-Genre   | Martial-Arts |         |
| Pet           | Dog          |         |

From clue 2, the person drinking tea and the owner of the dog have different parity positions. Since the dog is on position 1 (odd), the person drinking tea must be on an even position, which means it's on position 2.

|               |       1       |    2    |
| Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Tea     |
| Movie-Genre   | Martial-Arts |         |
| Pet           | Dog          |         |

Now we can fill in the remaining blanks. The person watching sports movies must be on position 2 (even), and the owner of the hamster must also be on an even position, which means it's on position 2.

Lv9-3x2-3	"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who's hobby is hiking and the person drinking milk have the same parity positions.
This means that either both are in odd-numbered positions (1) or both are in even-numbered positions (2).

2. The person who's hobby is hiking is not to the left of the person drinking milk.
This implies that if the hiker is in position 2, the milk drinker must be in position 1.

3. The owner of the frog is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is hiking.
Since there are only two positions, this means that the frog owner must be in position 1.

From clue 3, we know that the frog owner is in position 1. Now, let's combine this with clue 2:

If the hiker is in position 2, then the milk drinker must be in position 1 (clue 2). But wait! We already know that the frog owner is in position 1 (clue 3). This means that the frog owner and the milk drinker are the same person.

Now we can fill in some of the table:

|            |    1     |   2    |
| Beverage   | milk     |        |
| Hobby      |          | hiking |
| Pet        | frog     |        |

From clue 1, we know that the hiker (in position 2) and the milk drinker (in position 1) have the same parity positions. This is true since they both occupy odd-numbered or even-numbered positions.

Now, let's look at the remaining options:

* The person drinking soy-milk must be in position 2.
* The owner of the ferret can only be in position 2, which means that the hiker (in position 2) is also the owner of the ferret.

Here is the completed table:

Lv9-3x2-4	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person drinking cola and the person watching romance movies have the same parity positions.
This means that if one is in an odd position (1), the other must also be in an odd position, or if one is in an even position (2), the other must also be in an even position.

2. The owner of the frog is somewhere to the right of the person drinking milk.
Since there are only two positions, this means that the person drinking milk must be in position 1, and the owner of the frog must be in position 2.

Now, let's combine these clues with the given information:

* Position 1: drinks milk (from clue 2)
* Position 2: owns a frog (from clue 2)

Since the person drinking cola and the person watching romance movies have the same parity positions (clue 1), and position 1 is already occupied by the person drinking milk, it means that:

* Position 1: drinks milk, watches martial-arts (since it can't be romance)
* Position 2: owns a frog, drinks cola, watches romance

Here's the completed table:

Lv9-3x2-5	"Based on the given clues, I'll try to solve the puzzle.


From clue 1, we know that the person who writes and the person who plays ice-hockey are in different parity positions (i.e., one is in an odd position and the other is in an even position). Since there are only two positions, this means that the writer must be in position 1 and the ice-hockey player must be in position 2.


From clue 2, we know that the person who watches mystery movies is to the right of the person who plays ice-hockey. This means that the mystery movie fan must be in position 2.


Now, let's fill in the table:


|               |     1      |    2    |
| Hobby         | writing   | card-games|
| Movie-Genre   | animation | mystery  |
| Sport         | cycling   | ice-hockey|

The reasoning is as follows:

* The writer is in position 1 (from clue 1).
* The person who plays ice-hockey must be in position 2 (from clue 1), and the mystery movie fan is to their right, but since there's no one to the right of position 2, the mystery movie fan must be in the same position as the ice-hockey player. However, this would mean that we have two people with different hobbies/sports in the same position, which is not possible.
* Therefore, I swapped the sports for position 1 and 2, so now cycling is in position 1 and ice-hockey is in position 2.


Since there are only two options left for each category, the remaining ones must be filled in accordingly. The final solution table is:

Lv9-3x2-6	"Based on the clues provided:

From clue 1, since ""the person eating raspberry and the person who's sport is badminton have the same parity positions"", it means they must both be either in position 1 or both in position 2. 

From clue 2, ""the turkish is on the right of the person eating raspberry"" implies that if the person eating raspberry were in position 2, there would be no one to their left for Turkish to be right of. Therefore, the person eating raspberry must be in position 1.

Given the constraint from clue 1 and knowing the raspberry eater's position, it follows that badminton must also be in position 1.

Now we have this setup:

|               |     1     |    2    |
| Food          | Raspberry |         |
| Nationality   |           | Turkish |
| Sport         | Badminton |         |

The only food left for position 2 is tomato, and the only sport left (since badminton is taken) is skiing.

Therefore, the final solution table is:

| Music-Genre   | R&B     | Classical    |
| Pet           | Frog    | Rabbit       |

Here's my reasoning:

From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is camping and the owner of the rabbit have different parity positions. This means that if one is in position 1 (odd), the other must be in position 2 (even). Since there are only two positions, this implies that the camper is in position 1 and the rabbit owner is in position 2.

From clue 2, we know that the owner of the frog is on the left of the fan of classical music. This means that the frog owner must be in position 1, as they need to be on the left of someone. Given this information, we can now determine that the camper (position 1) owns the frog.

The only remaining piece of information is the person with the hobby ""magic-tricks"", who must be in position 2. The music genre for this person must be classical (as it's the only one left), and they own the rabbit.

| Music-Genre   | country    | metal      |
| Sport         | ice-hockey | baseball   |
| Transport     | snowmobile | scooter    |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 3, we know that the person driving the scooter is to the right of the person whose sport is baseball. This means that the scooter must be in position 2.

From clue 1, we know that the fan of country music and the person whose sport is baseball have the same parity positions (i.e., they are both either odd or even). Since baseball is not in position 1 (because scooter is to its right), it must be in position 2. But we already determined that scooter is in position 2, so baseball must be in position 1.

From clue 1 again, we know that country music is in the same parity position as baseball. Since baseball is in position 1, country music must also be in an odd position, which means it's in position 1.

The only remaining option for metal music is position 2.

Finally, from clue 2, we know that metal music is not to the right of scooter. This means that snowmobile (the only other transportation option) must be in position 1, and ice-hockey (the only other sport) must be in position 1 as well.

Here's how the clues were applied:

* Clue 1: The person eating spinach is on the left of the person eating lime, so spinach goes to position 1 and lime goes to position 2.
* Clue 3: The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the far right, so lacrosse goes to position 2.
* Clue 2: Since the person watching time-travel movies and the person who's sport is lacrosse have different parity positions (i.e., one is in an even-numbered position and the other is in an odd-numbered position), and considering that lacrosse is already assigned to position 2, time-travel must go to position 1. However, this would contradict Clue 1. Therefore, zombie movies should be paired with spinach in position 1.

| Movie-Genre   | Romance  | Mystery  |
| Nationality   | Colombian| American |
| Transport     | Quad-bike| Bus      |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 1, we know the person watching romance movies is on the left of the person driving the bus. This means the person watching romance movies must be in position 1.

From clue 2, we know the American and the person watching romance movies have different parity positions. Since the person watching romance movies is in an odd-numbered position (1), the American must be in an even-numbered position (2).

The only remaining option for the person in position 1 is Colombian.

Now, let's look at the transport options. We know the person driving the bus is in position 2, so the person in position 1 must use a quad-bike.

Finally, we can fill in the movie-genre for the person in position 2, which is mystery.
