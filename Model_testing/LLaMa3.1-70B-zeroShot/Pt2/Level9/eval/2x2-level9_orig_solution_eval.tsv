Lv9-2x2-1	"Based on the given clues, here is the step-by-step reasoning:


1. The person who's sport is rowing is in an odd position.
   - This means that the person who likes rowing must be in either position 1.

2. The person eating raspberry and the person who's sport is rowing have the same parity positions.
   - Since the person who likes rowing is in an odd position (from clue 1), this means the person who eats raspberry must also be in an odd position, which can only be position 1.


Now we know that:


- Position 1: Rowing and Raspberry
- Position 2: The remaining food and sport


The final solution table with '#############' around it is:


#############
|         |     1     |    2    |
| Food    | raspberry | grapes |
| Sport   | rowing    | parkour|

Lv9-2x2-2	"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The person drinking 7up and the person eating asparagus have the same parity positions.
This means that if one is in an odd position (e.g., column 1), the other must also be in an odd position.

2. The person drinking 7up is somewhere to the right of the person drinking milk.
Since there are only two columns, this implies that the person drinking milk must be in column 1, and the person drinking 7up must be in column 2.


From these clues, we can deduce the following:


* Column 1: Milk (beverage) - since it's to the left of 7up
* Column 2: 7up (beverage) - since it's to the right of milk


Now, considering clue 1 again, if the person drinking 7up is in column 2 (an even position), then the person eating asparagus must also be in an even position. Since there are no more even positions available (only two columns), this means that the person eating asparagus must be paired with 7up.


Column 1: Milk, pineapple
Column 2: 7up, asparagus

Here is the final solution table:


|            |     1     |     2     |
| Beverage   |  milk    |  7up      |
| Food       |  pineapple|  asparagus|

Lv9-2x2-3	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The fan of folk music and the person who prefers cycling have different parity positions, meaning one is in an odd-numbered position (1) and the other is in an even-numbered position (2).
2. The person who prefers ice-hockey is to the right of the person who prefers cycling.

From clue 2, we can deduce that:

* Cycling cannot be in position 2, because then there would be no one to the right of them.
* Therefore, Cycling must be in position 1.
* Ice-Hockey must be in position 2, as it is to the right of Cycling.

Now, let's consider clue 1. Since Cycling is in position 1 (an odd-numbered position), Folk music cannot also be in an odd-numbered position. Therefore:

* Folk music must be in position 2.
* R&B music must be in position 1, as it's the only one left.

So, we have:

#############
|               |    1    |     2      |
| Music-Genre   | R&B    | Folk       |

Lv9-2x2-4	"Based on the given clues, I will attempt to solve the puzzle.

From clue 1, we know that the person who prefers swimming and the person who prefers parkour are adjacent.

From clue 2, we know that the Mexican and the person who prefers swimming have different parity positions (i.e., one is in position 1 and the other is in position 2).

From clue 3, we know that the Argentine is to the right of the person who prefers parkour.

Now, let's try to put the pieces together:

* If the Mexican were on the left, then the person who prefers swimming would have to be on the right (due to clue 2). But this would contradict clue 3, since the Argentine would not be able to be on the right of the person who prefers parkour.
* Therefore, the Mexican must be on the right. This means that the person who prefers swimming is on the left (due to clue 2).

Now we can start filling in the table:

|               |    1    |     2     |
| Nationality   |         |           |
| Sport         | Swimming|           |

Since the Argentine is on the right of the person who prefers parkour, and the person who prefers swimming is already on the left, we can conclude that the person who prefers parkour must be in position 1.

|               |    1    |     2     |
| Nationality   |         |           |
| Sport         | Swimming| Parkour |

Finally, since the Mexican is on the right (due to clue 2), and the Argentine is also on the right of someone (clue 3), we can conclude that the Argentine must be in position 1.

|               |    1    |     2     |
| Nationality   | Argentine| Mexican |
| Sport         | Swimming| Parkour |

Here is the final solution:

#############
|               |    1    |     2     |
| Nationality   | Argentine| Mexican |

Lv9-2x2-5	"Based on the given clues, I will try to solve the puzzle.

From clue 1, we know that the person drinking Sprite and the person whose hobby is gardening are in different parity positions (i.e., one is in position 1 and the other is in position 2).

From clue 2, we know that the person drinking Sprite is on the left of the person whose hobby is gardening. This means that the person drinking Sprite must be in position 1.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|            |      1      |     2     |
| Beverage   |  Sprite    |           |
| Hobby      |             | Gardening |

Since the person drinking Sprite and the person whose hobby is gardening are in different parity positions, the person whose hobby is woodworking must be in position 1 for Hobby. But that's not possible since the person whose hobby is gardening is already in position 2.

Therefore, the person whose hobby is woodworking must be in position 1 for Hobby, but with a different beverage (which is Iced-tea).

Here is the final solution table:


#############
|            |      1      |     2     |
| Beverage   |  Sprite    |  Iced-tea  |

Lv9-2x2-6	"Let's break down the clues:

Clue 1: The owner of the dog and the person eating pineapple have the same parity positions.
This means that if one is in position 1, the other must also be in an odd-numbered position (since there are only two positions).

Clue 2: The person eating pineapple is on the left of the person eating lemon.
This implies that the person eating pineapple is in position 1.

Combining these clues, we can conclude that:

* The person eating pineapple is in position 1.
* Since the owner of the dog and the person eating pineapple have the same parity positions, the owner of the dog must also be in an odd-numbered position. In this case, it's also position 1 (since there are only two positions).

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|        |     1     |   2    |
| Food   | Pineapple | Lemon  |
| Pet    | Dog       | Ferret |

So, the person eating pineapple owns a dog, and the person eating lemon owns a ferret."	{'food': ['pineapple', 'lemon'], 'pet': ['dog', 'ferret']}	True	4	True
Lv9-2x2-7	"Let's break down the clues:

Clue 1: The fisherman and the owner of the rat have different parity positions.

This means that if one is in an even position (2), the other must be in an odd position (1).

Clue 2: The owner of the snake is in an odd position.

Since there's only one odd position, this must refer to person 1. So, person 1 has a snake.

Now we can try to fill in the table:

|       |     1     |   2   |
| Job   |           |       |
| Pet   | Snake    |       |

From Clue 1, since the owner of the rat is not in an odd position (because person 1 has a snake), they must be in an even position. This means person 2 has a rat.

|       |     1     |   2   |
| Job   |           |       |
| Pet   | Snake    | Rat |

Now we need to fill in the job column. Since the fisherman and the owner of the rat have different parity positions, and person 2 (even position) has a rat, the fisherman must be in an odd position, which is person 1.

|       |     1     |   2   |
| Job   | Fisherman|       |
| Pet   | Snake    | Rat |

The only job left for person 2 is nurse.

Lv9-2x2-8	"Based on the clues:

Clue 1: The person drinking hot-chocolate and the person driving the roller have the same parity positions.
This means that both are either in position 1 or both are in position 2.

Clue 2: The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking coffee.
This means that coffee is in position 1 and hot-chocolate is in position 2.

Now, we can combine these two clues:

If hot-chocolate is in position 2, then roller must also be in position 2 (by Clue 1).
And if coffee is in position 1, then quad-bike must also be in position 1 (since there are only two means of transport).

So, the final solution table is:


#############
|             |     1     |       2       |
| Beverage    | Coffee   | Hot-Chocolate|

Lv9-2x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, we will analyze each clue step by step.

1. The first clue tells us that the person watching satire movies is to the right of the person watching family movies. This means in our table:

|               |   1    |     2     |
| Movie-Genre   | Family | Satire    |
| Transport     |        |           |

Since we do not have any information about the transport yet, let's proceed with the next clue.

2. The second clue states that the person driving the car and the person watching satire movies are in different parity positions. Given our setup from clue 1:

- Satire is in an even position (2).
- This means the car cannot be in an even position; it must be in an odd position, which is position 1.

So, based on these clues, we can now complete the table as follows:

#############
|               |   1    |     2     |
| Movie-Genre   | Family | Satire    |
| Transport     | Car    | Motorbike|

The final solution respects all given conditions: 
- The person watching satire movies is to the right of the person watching family movies.
- The person driving the car (in position 1) and the person watching satire movies (in position 2) have different parity positions."	{'movie-genre': ['family', 'satire'], 'transport': ['car', 'motorbike']}	True	4	True
Lv9-2x2-10	"Let's break down the clues:

Clue 1: The person eating apricot and the Indonesian have the same parity positions, meaning they are either both in position 1 or both in position 2.

Clue 2: The person eating carrot is to the right of the person eating apricot, so the person eating apricot must be in position 1, and the person eating carrot must be in position 2.

Now, let's combine these clues:

If the person eating apricot is in position 1 (from Clue 2), then the Indonesian must also be in position 1 or 2 (from Clue 1). But since there are only two positions, and the person eating apricot is already in position 1, the Indonesian cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the Indonesian must be in position 2.

So, we have:
