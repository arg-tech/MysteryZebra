| Sport       | parkour   | baseball     | climbing    | cricket   | surfing     |
| Transport   | scooter   | bus          | skateboard  | snowmobile| taxi        |

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:


From clue 3, we know that the owner of the goldfish is not to the right of the owner of the mouse. Combining this with clue 9, which states that the owner of the mouse is on the left or right of the person drinking fanta, we can deduce that the owner of the mouse must be in position 2.


From clue 12, we know that the person driving the bus and the person who's sport is parkour have the same parity positions. Since the person driving the scooter (position 1) is on the far left, this means that the person driving the bus must be in an even position, specifically position 2 or 4.


From clue 16, we know that the owner of the goldfish is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bus. This means that the owner of the goldfish must be in position 1.


From clue 8, we know that the person drinking mirinda is on the right of the person drinking water. Since the person drinking water is in position 1, this means that the person drinking mirinda must be in position 3 or higher.


From clue 10, we know that the person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the paramedic. This means that the paramedic must be in position 4 or 5.


From clue 25, we know that the person drinking almond-milk and the person driving the snowmobile have different parity positions. Since the person drinking mirinda (position 3 or higher) is on the right of the person drinking water (position 1), this means that the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 2 or 4.


From clue 22, we know that the chef and the person who's sport is cricket have different parity positions. Since the entrepreneur (even position) is not to the left of the fisherman (clue 24), this means that the chef must be in an odd position, specifically position 3.


The rest of the puzzle can be solved by combining these deductions with the remaining clues.

Lv9-5x5-8	"After analyzing the given logic puzzle, I've arrived at a solution. Here is the completed table with the correct information:


|            |     1     |      2      |       3       |    4     |     5      |

| Sport      | volleyball| climbing    | golf          | basketball| weightlifting|


Here's a brief explanation of the solution process:

* From clues 2, 3, and 12, we can deduce that the person eating cranberry is on the far left (position 1) or far right. Since the person drinking milk is also the person eating cranberry (clue 14), they must be in position 1.
* Clue 9 states that the person drinking cola is in an odd position, so they must be in either position 1, 3, or 5. However, since milk is already in position 1, and soy-milk is already in position 4 (given), cola must be in position 2.
* Clue 17 states that the person drinking cola is to the left of the person who's hobby is hiking. Therefore, hiking must be in position 3 or 5. However, since woodworking is to the left of photography (clue 6), and woodworking cannot be in position 1 (occupied by baking), it must be in position 2. This means hiking must be in position 5.
* Clue 10 states that the person who's sport is golf is on the left or right of the person who's sport is basketball. Since basketball is to the right of hiking (clue 7), and golf cannot be to the left of artichoke (clue 25), golf must be in position 3.
* Clue 21 states that weightlifting is between volleyball and hiking. Since hiking is in position 5, weightlifting must be in position 4, and volleyball must be in position 1 or 2. However, since milk is already in position 1, volleyball must be in position 2 (occupied by cola). Therefore, we need to swap the positions of cola and fanta.
* The remaining clues can be used to fill in the rest of the table.

#############

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

From clue 18, we know that the owner of the dog is on the far right. From clue 1, we know that the person driving the skateboard is either on the far left or far right. Since the far right is already occupied by the owner of the dog, the person driving the skateboard must be on the far left.

From clue 10, we know that the person drinking sprite is to the left of the person driving the bike. Therefore, the person drinking sprite must be in position 1.

From clue 25, we know that the owner of the bird and the egyptian have different parity positions. Since the egyptian has the same parity positions as the person driving the motorbike (clue 3), the owner of the bird cannot be in an even-numbered position. Therefore, the owner of the bird must be in position 1 or 5.

From clue 4, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is to the right of the owner of the bird. Since the owner of the bird cannot be in an even-numbered position, the owner of the bird must be in position 1. Therefore, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 2 or 4.

From clue 5, we know that the person driving the motorbike is to the left of the owner of the bird. Since the owner of the bird is in position 3 (based on previous deductions), the person driving the motorbike must be in position 1 or 2.

However, since the skateboard is already in position 1, the person driving the motorbike must be in position 2.

From clue 9, we know that the owner of the chinchilla is to the left of the american. Since the american cannot be in an even-numbered position (due to clue 2), the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 1 or 3. However, since the skateboard is already in position 1, and the motorbike is in position 2, the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 4.

From clue 20, we know that the mechanic is to the right of the person driving the scooter. Since the person driving the scooter cannot be in an even-numbered position (due to clue 12), the person driving the scooter must be in position 3 or 5. However, since the motorbike is already in position 2, and the owner of the chinchilla is in position 4, the person driving the scooter must be in position 3.

From clue 16, we know that the dutch has the same parity positions as the person driving the bike. Therefore, the dutch must be in an even-numbered position. From clue 19, we know that the dutch is to the right of the freelancer. Since the freelancer is drinking coffee (clue 15), and the person drinking cola cannot be in an odd-numbered position (due to clue 21), the dutch must be in position 2 or 4.

However, since the motorbike is already in position 2, the dutch must be in position 4.

From clue 22, we know that the person drinking almond-milk and the person driving the van have the same parity positions. Since the person drinking almond-milk cannot be in an even-numbered position (due to previous deductions), the person drinking almond-milk must be in an odd-numbered position. Therefore, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 3 or 5.

From clue 4, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is to the right of the owner of the bird. Since the owner of the bird is already in position 3 (based on previous deductions), the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 4 or 5. However, since the dutch is already in position 4, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 5.

The rest of the puzzle can be solved by filling in the remaining gaps and using process of elimination to determine the correct order."	{'beverage': ['sprite', 'cola', 'coffee', 'almond-milk', 'juice'], 'job': ['doctor', 'architect', 'freelancer', 'videographer', 'mechanic'], 'nationality': ['dutch', 'american', 'egyptian', 'indian', 'nigerian'], 'pet': ['lizard', 'bird', 'snake', 'chinchilla', 'dog'], 'transport': ['bike', 'motorbike', 'scooter', 'skateboard', 'van']}	True	10	False
