Lv9-6x2-1	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a possible solution:


|               |      1      |       2       |
| Beverage      |  milk       |   sprite      |

| Movie-Genre   | documentary | thriller      |
| Nationality   | american    | french        |
| Transport     | taxi        | helicopter    |

This solution satisfies all the given conditions:


1. The person driving the taxi (column 1) is to the left of the photographer (column 2).
2. The person drinking sprite (column 2) is to the right of the person who's hobby is baking (column 1).
3. The French person (column 2) is to the right of the American person (column 1).
4. The person watching documentary movies and the person who's hobby is baking have the same parity positions (both in column 1).

Please note that this solution assumes that ""parity positions"" refers to both being in either even or odd-numbered columns, which in this case means they are both in column 1.

Here is the final solution with '#############' around it:

Lv9-6x2-2	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |      1      |        2        |
| Beverage      | Tea         | Hot-Chocolate   |

| Transport     | Tram         | Bus             |

 

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning:

From clue 5, we know that the person who's hobby is video-games (VG) and the owner of the dog have different parity positions. This means VG cannot be in position 2 (because then the dog owner would also be in an even position). Therefore, VG must be in position 1.

Clue 4 reinforces this conclusion: if VG were to the right of R&B, it would mean VG is in position 2, which contradicts what we just deduced.

From clue 2, we know that the project-manager (PM) is on the right of the person drinking tea. Since VG is already in position 1 and drinks tea (deduced from the beverage options), PM must be in position 2.

Clue 1 states that the bus driver is to the right of VG. Therefore, the bus driver must be in position 2, which means the PM drives a bus.

With these positions filled, we can start filling in the remaining gaps:

* The R&B fan cannot be to the right of VG (clue 3), so they must be in position 1, and their beverage is tea.
* The owner of the dog has a different parity position than VG (clue 5), so they must be in position 2. Since PM is already there, this means the pet in position 2 is a dog.
* Traveling is the only hobby left, which goes to position 2.
* Hot-chocolate is the only beverage left, which goes to position 2.

Lv9-6x2-3	"After analyzing the given clues, I've come up with a solution for the logic puzzle:


#############

| Pet           | lizard | pony      |
| Sport         | cycling| badminton|
| Transport     | quad-bike| train    |
#############


Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how I arrived at this solution:


1. From clue 5, we know the person eating kiwi is driving the train. So, we can fill in the transport column for person 2 as ""train"".
2. Clue 4 tells us that the person eating kiwi is not to the right of the person watching horror movies. Since the person eating kiwi is already assigned to person 2 (driving the train), the person watching horror movies must be person 1.
3. From clue 2, we know that the person watching horror movies is somewhere to the left of the person eating banana. So, person 1 is eating banana and watching horror movies.
4. Clue 7 states that the fan of r&b music is not to the left of the person watching horror movies. This means the fan of r&b music must be person 2.
5. Clue 6 tells us that the person eating kiwi (person 2) is not to the right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since person 2 is driving the train and eating kiwi, the person who's sport is cycling must be person 1.
6. From clue 3, we know that the person who's sport is cycling (person 1) has a different parity position than the person driving the quad-bike. This means person 2 must drive the quad-bike and take part in badminton.
7. Clue 1 states that the owner of the pony is to the right of the fan r&b music, which is person 2. So, person 2 owns a pony.
8. The only pet left is the lizard, so it must be owned by person 1.

By combining these deductions, we arrive at the final solution table:

After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############

| Food          | Blueberry  | Zucchini   |

| Sport         | Ice-Hockey | Tennis     |
| Transport     | Snowmobile | Tram       |

#############


Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 5, we know that the person eating blueberry is not the person who's hobby is gardening. So, the person on column 1 must be eating blueberry.

Clue 2 tells us that the person who's hobby is gardening (column 2) is to the right of the owner of the snake. Since there are only two pets, the cat must be with the person in column 1.

Clue 3 states that the owner of the snake and the person driving the tram have the same parity positions. This means they must both be on either column 1 or column 2. However, since we already know the person in column 2 is gardening (and not driving a tram), this implies the person in column 1 drives a snowmobile.

Clue 4 says that the person who's hobby is sudoku is not to the right of the person watching zombie movies. This means the sudoku enthusiast must be on column 1, and the zombie movie fan is on column 2.

Now we can deduce the rest:

* The sport for the person in column 1 is ice-hockey (since tennis is paired with zucchini).
* The pet owner in column 2 has a snake.
* The person driving the tram must be in column 2, and their hobby is gardening.

From statement 3, we know that the person whose hobby is video-games is on the far right.

From statement 5, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is not to the right of the person who's sport is tennis. Therefore, the person whose sport is tennis must be on the far left.

|               |     1      |       2       |

From statement 6, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is not to the left of the owner of the dog. Therefore, the owner of the dog must be on the far left.

 Wait, no! That contradicts our previous conclusion that tennis is on the far left.


Let's try again. From statement 1, we know that the owner of the mouse is not to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. This means that either the owner of the mouse is on the same column as the person drinking hot-chocolate, or the owner of the mouse is to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.


From statement 6, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is not to the left of the owner of the dog. This means that either the owner of the dog is on the same column as the person drinking hot-chocolate, or the owner of the dog is to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.


Combining these two statements, we can conclude that the owner of the mouse and the owner of the dog cannot be in the same column. Therefore, one must be on the far left and the other on the far right.


Since the person whose hobby is video-games is on the far right (statement 3), the owner of the dog must also be on the far right. This means that the owner of the mouse is on the far left.

From statement 2, we know that the person watching spy movies is somewhere to the left of the owner of the dog. Therefore, the person whose movie-genre is spy must be on the far left.

Let's go through the reasoning:

1. The person drinking 7up is somewhere to the right of the person eating watermelon.
This implies that lemonade is on the left and 7up is on the right.

2. The fan of blues and the person drinking 7up have different parity positions.
Since there are only two rows, this means they must be in different columns. Given the previous clue, we can deduce that blues is associated with the person drinking lemonade (column 1).

3. The person who's sport is badminton is somewhere to the left of the chef.
This implies that badminton is on the left and skateboarding is on the right.

4. The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile.
Given the previous clues, we can deduce that lemonade is associated with taxi (column 1).

5. The person eating strawberry is not to the left of the person driving the taxi.

From clue 5, we know that the person eating avocado is on the right of the person who's hobby is traveling.

| Transport     | airplane  |                |

From clue 2, we know that the fan of classical music and the person driving the airplane have the same parity positions.

From clue 3, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is not the person watching zombie movies.


Let's fill in some more:

Lv9-6x2-10	"Based on the given clues, I'll try to solve the puzzle. Here's my attempt:


|               |      1       |      2       |
| Beverage      | water        | soy-milk     |
| Food          | potato       | grapefruit   |
| Hobby         | video-games  | magic-tricks |
| Movie-Genre   | documentary  | martial-arts |
| Music-Genre   | techno       | metal        |
| Sport         | water-polo   | biathlon      |

Here's my reasoning:

From clue 2, the person watching documentaries eats potato. Since potato is on the left in the food row, I'll place ""documentary"" on the left as well.

From clue 1, the person who plays video-games can't be to the left of the person drinking soy-milk. This means that soy-milk must be on the right. Therefore, water is on the left.

Clue 4 states that the fan of techno and the person drinking water have the same parity positions (i.e., both are in either even or odd columns). Since water is on the left, I'll place techno on the left as well.

From clue 5, techno is to the left of grapefruit. Therefore, grapefruit must be on the right.

Clue 3 states that the person who likes water-polo is to the left of the fan of metal. This means that water-polo is on the left and metal is on the right.

Finally, biathlon is the only sport left, so I'll place it on the right.


The final solution table is:
