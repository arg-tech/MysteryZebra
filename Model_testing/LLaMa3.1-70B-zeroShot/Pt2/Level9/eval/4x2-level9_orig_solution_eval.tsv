Lv9-4x2-1	"After analyzing the puzzle, I came up with a solution that satisfies all the conditions:


#############
|               |      1       |      2       |
| Beverage      | almond-milk | tea          |
| Hobby         | magic-tricks | skydiving    |
| Job           | videographer | writer       |
| Music-Genre   | soul         | hip-hop     |
#############


Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

* From condition 1, we know that the person who likes magic-tricks is on the left of the person drinking tea. So, magic-tricks must be in position 1.
* Condition 2 states that the writer and the person who likes skydiving have different parity positions (i.e., one is odd and the other is even). This means that the writer cannot be in position 1 or 3, so they must be in position 2. Therefore, the videographer is in position 1.
* Condition 3 states that the fan of hip-hop is on the right of the fan of soul. Since we already have a person with magic-tricks and almond-milk in position 1, and we know that tea is in position 2 (from condition 1), the music-genres must be arranged as follows: soul in position 1 and hip-hop in position 2.

Putting it all together, we get the solution above."	{'beverage': ['almond-milk', 'tea'], 'hobby': ['magic-tricks', 'skydiving'], 'job': ['videographer', 'writer'], 'music-genre': ['soul', 'hip-hop']}	True	6	False
Lv9-4x2-2	"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The videographer and the person driving the train have different parity positions, meaning one is in an odd position (1) and the other is in an even position (2).
2. The person driving the train is not to the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
3. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is somewhere to the left of the colombian.

From clue 3, we know that the person who likes ice-hockey must be in position 1, since they are to the left of the colombian.

| Sport         | Ice-Hockey   |              |
| Transport     |              |              |

From clue 2, we know that the person driving the train cannot be in position 2, since they would be to the right of the ice-hockey fan. Therefore, the train must be driven by the person in position 1.

|               |      1       |      2       |
| Job           |              |              |

| Sport         | Ice-Hockey   |              |
| Transport     | Train        |              |

Now, from clue 1, we know that the videographer must be in position 2 (even), since the train driver is in position 1 (odd).

|               |      1       |      2       |

| Sport         | Ice-Hockey   |              |
| Transport     | Train        |              |

Since the colombian must be to the right of the ice-hockey fan (clue 3), we can conclude that the polish person is in position 1.

|               |      1       |      2       |

Finally, we can deduce that the person who likes sailing must be in position 2.

From clue 2, we know the Russian is on the right of the person who likes reading.

From clue 3, we know the person who likes reading is to the left of the person eating pear.

From clue 1, we know the person who likes rock-climbing and the scientist have different parity positions. Since the person who likes rock-climbing is in position 2 (even), the scientist must be in position 1 (odd).

Lv9-4x2-4	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 2, we know that the owner of the turtle is in either position 1 or 2 (since they have the same parity as the person who likes reading), and the person who likes reading must be in either position 1 or 2.

From clue 3, we know that the person who likes cricket and the person who likes woodworking are in the same parity positions. This means that if one is in position 1, the other must also be in position 1 (or both in position 2).

Now, let's combine these clues:

* If the owner of the turtle is in position 1, then the person who likes reading must also be in position 1.
* But clue 3 says that the person who likes cricket and woodworking are in the same parity positions. This means that if one is in position 1, the other must also be in position 1.

So, we can conclude that:

* Position 1: Owner of turtle (reading), Woodworking, Cricket
* Position 2: ? ?

From clue 1, we know that the owner of the turtle is on the right of the person eating apricot. This means that the person eating apricot must be in position 1, and the owner of the turtle must be in position 2.

But wait! We just concluded that the owner of the turtle is in position 1!

This means that our initial assumption was wrong. The correct solution is:

* Position 1: Apricot (reading), Skateboarding
* Position 2: Asparagus (woodworking, cricket), Turtle

So, the final solution table is:

Lv9-4x2-5	"Based on the given clues, I will try to solve the puzzle and fill in the table.


From clue 1, we know that the lizard owner is to the left of the bus driver.
From clue 3, we also know that the lizard owner is to the left of the person watching satire movies.

Combining these two clues, we can conclude that:


|               |      1       |     2     |
| Food          |              |           |

| Transport     |              |           |

The lizard owner is in position 1 (since they are to the left of both the bus driver and the satire movie watcher). The bus driver can't be in position 1, so they must be in position 2.


From clue 2, we know that the lemon eater and the motorbike driver have the same parity positions. This means that if the lemon eater is in an odd-numbered position (1), then the motorbike driver must also be in an odd-numbered position (which is not possible since the bus driver is already in position 2). Therefore, the lemon eater must be in an even-numbered position (2).


Now we can start filling in the table:


|               |      1       |     2     |

| Transport     |              | bus       |

The motorbike driver must be in position 1 (since they have the same parity as the lemon eater).

| Food          | cranberry    | lemon     |

| Pet           | lizard       |           |
| Transport     | motorbike    | bus       |

The person watching satire movies can't be in position 1 (since the lizard owner is to their left), so they must be in position 2.

| Pet           | lizard   | cat        |
| Sport         | soccer    | basketball |

Explanation:

* From clue 1, we know the person watching comedy movies is to the right of the person who's sport is soccer. This means the comedy movie fan must be in position 2.
* From clue 2, we know the fan of ambient music and the owner of the cat have the same parity positions. Since there are only two positions, this means they must be in opposite positions (i.e., one in position 1 and the other in position 2). We also know from clue 3 that the indie fan is to the right of the ambient fan. This implies that the ambient fan is in position 1.
* Now, since the cat owner has the same parity as the ambient fan (position 1), we can place the cat in position 2 and the lizard in position 1.
* Finally, with soccer being on the left side (from clue 1) and basketball on the right side, the sport row is complete.

| Food        |          |                 |
| Hobby       |          | Chess           |
| Job         | Musician |                 |
| Transport   | Train    | Bus             |

From clue 1, we know the musician and the person eating peach have different parity positions. Since the musician is in position 1 (an odd number), the person eating peach must be in position 2:


|             |    1     |        2        |
| Food        | Banana   | Peach           |
| Hobby       |          | Chess           |
| Job         | Musician |                 |
| Transport   | Train    | Bus             |

The only hobby left is fishing, so it must belong to the musician:


|             |    1     |        2        |
| Food        | Banana   | Peach           |
| Hobby       | Fishing  | Chess           |
| Job         | Musician |                 |
| Transport   | Train    | Bus             |

The only job left is project-manager, so it must belong to the person in position 2:


|             |    1     |        2        |
| Food        | Banana   | Peach           |
| Hobby       | Fishing  | Chess           |
| Job         | Musician | Project-Manager |
| Transport   | Train    | Bus             |

The final solution table is:
