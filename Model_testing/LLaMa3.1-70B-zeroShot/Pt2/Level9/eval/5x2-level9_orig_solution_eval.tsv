Lv9-5x2-2	"Based on the given clues, I will attempt to solve the puzzle.


From clue 1, we know that the person eating cucumber is on the right of the person eating mango.

From clue 2, we can deduce that the fan of reggae music is either in position 1 or 3 (since they are on the left or right of the person drinking sprite). Let's assume for now that the fan of reggae is in position 1.


From clue 4, we know that the owner of the mouse is somewhere to the right of the fan of jazz. Since there are only two positions, this means that the owner of the mouse must be in position 2.


Now, from clue 3, we know that the colombian and the person drinking sprite have different parity positions (i.e., one is in an even position and the other is in an odd position). If the colombian were in position 1, this would mean that the person drinking sprite is in position 2. However, this contradicts clue 4, which states that the owner of the mouse is in position 2.


Therefore, we can conclude that the colombian is not in position 1. Let's try placing them in position 2 instead.


Here is a possible solution:

| Beverage      | water    | sprite   |

Lv9-5x2-3	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |    1     |   2   |
| Beverage      | Juice    | Soy-milk|
| Job           | Pilot    | Analyst |
| Music-Genre   | D&B      | Pop     |
| Pet           | Rat      | Mouse   |
| Transport     | Taxi     | Bus     |


Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 4, we know that the fan of pop music is to the left of the person drinking juice.

From clue 2, we know that the fan of pop music and the person driving the taxi have different parity positions. This means that the fan of pop music cannot be in position 1 (because the taxi would then be in an odd-numbered position). Therefore, the fan of pop music must be in position 2.

From clue 4 again, we know that the person drinking juice is to the right of the fan of pop music. Since the fan of pop music is in position 2, the person drinking juice must be in position 1.

Now, from clue 5, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse. We also know that the fan of pop music (in position 2) cannot be to the left of the owner of the mouse (because then the analyst would be to the right of the owner of the mouse, which contradicts clue 1). Therefore, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 2.

However, this creates a contradiction with our previous conclusion that the fan of pop music is in position 2. To resolve this, we need to swap the positions of the person drinking juice and the person drinking soy-milk.

After doing so, we can use clue 3 to determine that the analyst is in position 1 (because the person driving the taxi is on their right).

Finally, from clue 1, we know that the owner of the mouse cannot be to the left of the analyst. Therefore, the owner of the mouse must be in position 2.

The remaining positions can be filled in accordingly.

Lv9-5x2-4	"After analyzing the given information, I was able to fill in the table as follows:


#############
|               |     1     |     2     |
| Food          | peach    | corn      |

| Nationality   | colombian| brazilian|
| Sport         | handball | rowing    |
| Transport     | roller   | trike     |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 3, we know that the Colombian is to the left of the person who likes handball. Since there are only two columns, this means the Colombian must be in column 1.

Clue 2 tells us that the Brazilian and the person eating corn have the same parity positions (i.e., both in odd-numbered or even-numbered columns). Since the Colombian is already occupying column 1, the Brazilian must be in column 2. This also means the person eating corn must be in column 2.

Clue 1 tells us that the person driving the roller and the Colombian have the same parity positions. Since the Colombian is in column 1 (an odd-numbered column), the person driving the roller must also be in an odd-numbered column, which is column 1.

Clue 4 states that the person who likes handball and the fan of blues music have the same parity positions. Since the Colombian is already in column 1, and the Brazilian (and thus the person eating corn) are in column 2, this means the person who likes handball must be in column 2 (an even-numbered column). This also means the fan of blues music must be in an odd-numbered column, which is column 1.

Now that we have most of the columns filled, let's look at the remaining options. The only food left is peach, which can go in column 1. The only sport left is rowing, which can go in column 2. The only music genre left is trance, which can go in column 1 (since blues is already taken by column 2). Finally, the person using a trike must be in column 2.

The resulting table should match the above solution."	{'food': ['peach', 'corn'], 'music-genre': ['trance', 'blues'], 'nationality': ['colombian', 'brazilian'], 'sport': ['handball', 'rowing'], 'transport': ['roller', 'trike']}	True	8	False
Lv9-5x2-5	"Here's my attempt at solving the puzzle.


After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |      1      |     2     |
| Hobby         | photography | fishing   |
| Movie-Genre   | drama       | comedy    |

| Pet           | rat          | goldfish  |
| Transport     | tram         | quad-bike |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 3, we know that the person watching comedy movies is in an even position. Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), this means that the comedy movie fan must be in position 2.


Clue 1 tells us that the photography hobbyist and the comedy movie fan have different parity positions. This implies that the photography hobbyist must be in an odd position, i.e., position 1.


From clue 4, we know that the Argentine is somewhere to the left of the person driving the quad-bike. Given that the quad-bike driver can only be in position 2 (since the comedy movie fan is already there), this means that the Argentine must be in position 1.


Clue 2 tells us that the tram driver is on either side of the rat owner. This implies that the tram driver cannot be in position 2, since the quad-bike driver would then be in between the tram driver and the rat owner. Therefore, the tram driver must be in position 1.


The remaining pieces fall into place:


* The person who likes drama movies (and is not the comedy fan) must be in position 1.
* The fishing hobbyist (who is not the photography enthusiast) must be in position 2.
* The goldfish owner (who is not the rat owner) must be in position 2.


So, here's the final solution:

Note: 

1. ""same parity positions"" means that both the cola drinker and the person watching scientific movies are in either both odd or even positions (in this case, both are in position 1).
2. The clues imply that the Australian is to the left of the fan of d&b music, but since there's only one possible configuration for the beverage and movie-genre columns given the other clues, we can determine the rest of the table without needing further information about the relative positions of the australian and the d&b fan."	{'beverage': ['cola', 'sprite'], 'movie-genre': ['scientific', 'family'], 'music-genre': ['d&b', 'salsa'], 'nationality': ['australian', 'canadian'], 'sport': ['skiing', 'lacrosse']}	True	8	False
Lv9-5x2-7	"Let's analyze the clues:


From clue 2, we know that the person who's hobby is filmmaking is also the person who's sport is swimming.


From clue 5, we know that the person driving the bus and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks have the same parity positions. Since there are only two people, this means they must be in opposite columns. Let's assume the bus driver is in column 1 and the magic-tricks enthusiast is in column 2.


From clue 4, we know that the fan of metal is to the right of the fan of salsa. This means the fan of salsa must be in column 1.


Now, let's combine this information:

From clue 4, we know that the software-developer is the person who's sport is basketball. So, we can start by filling in the ""Job"" and ""Sport"" columns for one of the people:

| Sport         | basketball    |                    |

From clue 3, we know that the person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the person eating cucumber. This means that the person in column 2 has a hobby of chess.

From clue 2, we know that the person who's sport is rowing and the person eating cucumber have the same parity positions. Since there are only two rows, this means that the person who's sport is rowing must be in column 1.

| Sport         | rowing       | basketball    |

From clue 1, we know that the person who's sport is basketball is on the left or right of the person watching sports movies. Since the person in column 2 has a hobby of chess, and the person who's sport is basketball is already in column 1, this means that the person in column 2 must be watching zombie movies.

Now, we can fill in the ""Food"" column. Since there are only two types of food (cucumber and pumpkin), and the person who's sport is rowing has the same parity position as the person eating cucumber, this means that the person in column 1 must be eating cucumber.

|               |      1      |         2          |
