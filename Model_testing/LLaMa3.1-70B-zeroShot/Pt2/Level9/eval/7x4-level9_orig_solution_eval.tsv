From clue 10, we know the egyptian is on the far left. From clue 2, we know the person who's hobby is filmmaking and the person eating pumpkin have different parity positions, so they cannot be in positions 1 and 3 or 2 and 4.

Let's start by placing the egyptian in position 1.


|               |     1      |       2       |     3      |      4      |

From clue 6, we know the person eating grapefruit is between the turkish and the person drinking hot-chocolate. We also know that the mexican is in position 2 or 4 (from clue 21). If the mexican was in position 2, then the person drinking lemonade would be in position 3, which would mean the person eating pumpkin would be in position 4 (from clue 4), but this would put the person eating grapefruit on the far right, with no room for the turkish. Therefore, the mexican must be in position 2.

From clue 4, we know the person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person eating pumpkin. This means that the person drinking lemonade must be in position 1 or 2.


|               |     1      |       2       |     3      |      4      |

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

From clue 13, we know that the Indian is on the far left. Clue 18 tells us that the person who's hobby is photography is on the left or right of the Indian, so it must be in position 1.

Clue 17 says that the person eating strawberry is on the far right, which puts strawberry in position 4. Clue 11 tells us that the person watching musical movies is not to the left of the person eating strawberry, so musical movies must be in position 2 or 3. However, clue 20 says that the person watching spy movies is on the left or right of the person watching disaster movies, and since the person watching disaster movies can't be to the right of the person watching spy movies (clue 25), the only possibility is for musical movies to be in position 2.

Clues 19 and 1 together tell us that the entrepreneur is in position 4. Clue 12 says that the fan techno is the person watching spy movies, which puts techno in position 3. The rest of the puzzle falls into place from there.
