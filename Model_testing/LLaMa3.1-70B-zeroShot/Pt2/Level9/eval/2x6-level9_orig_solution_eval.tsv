Lv9-2x6-3	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a solution for the puzzle:


#############

| Pet           | Snake | Mouse  | Hedgehog | Bird       | Chinchilla | Turtle |

#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* Clues 1 and 10 imply that the fan of disco is in an odd-numbered position (3 or 5), and the owner of the bird is also in an odd-numbered position.
* Clue 9 implies that the fan of disco and the owner of the hedgehog have different parity positions, so the owner of the hedgehog must be in an even-numbered position (2 or 4).
* Clues 13 and 16 imply that the owner of the chinchilla is to the right of the owner of the hedgehog, and the fan of hip-hop is to the right of the fan of folk.
* Clue 5 implies that the owner of the mouse is next to the owner of the chinchilla. Since the owner of the mouse is also to the left of the fan of jazz (clue 4), we can place the owner of the mouse in position 2 and the owner of the chinchilla in position 5.
* Clues 3, 7, and 8 imply that the fan of metal cannot be to the left of the owners of the turtle or snake. Since the owner of the turtle is also not to the left of the fan of metal (clue 8), we can place the fan of metal in position 1.
* Clues 11 and 17 imply that the fan of jazz is to the left of the fan of metal, so the fan of jazz must be in position 2. However, this conflicts with our previous placement of the owner of the mouse in position 2. To resolve this, we can swap the positions of the fan of jazz and the owner of the snake.
* Clue 14 implies that the owner of the snake is on the far left or far right. Since the owner of the snake is already in a corner position (1), we don't need to move it.
* The remaining pets and music genres can be placed in the remaining positions, ensuring that all clues are satisfied.

Note that this solution assumes that the puzzle has a unique solution. If there are multiple possible solutions, please let me know and I'll try to find alternative arrangements that satisfy all the clues."	{'music-genre': ['metal', 'jazz', 'folk', 'disco', 'trance', 'hip-hop'], 'pet': ['snake', 'mouse', 'hedgehog', 'bird', 'chinchilla', 'turtle']}	True	2	False

Here's a brief explanation of how the solution was derived:


From clue 4, we know that the person who likes cycling is to the left of the accountant. From clue 11, we also know that this person is to the right of the person who likes golf.


Clue 16 tells us that the person who likes golf is on the far left or far right. Combining this with clue 14 (software-developer is on the far left or far right), we can place the software-developer and the person who likes golf in positions 1 and 6 (either way around). However, since the analyst (clue 8) cannot be on the far left or far right (due to other constraints), position 1 must be the person who likes golf.


Clues 7 and 15 indicate that the manager is in an odd position and has the same parity as the person who likes cycling. The only possible placement for this pair is positions 3 and 5, with the person who likes biathlon (clue 9) occupying position 4.


The remaining positions can be filled using clues 1-13:


The mechanic cannot be to the right of the person who likes tennis (clue 1), so they must occupy position 2 or 5. Clue 10 indicates that the mechanic is to the left of the manager, so position 5 is ruled out.


Clue 6 tells us that the analyst has a different parity than the person who likes cycling, placing them in an even position. However, since the biathlon enthusiast (clue 9) already occupies an even position, the analyst must occupy position 2.


The remaining job and sport can be placed using clues 12-13:


The firefighter cannot like cycling (clue 12), so they must occupy position 6. This leaves the accountant in position 5, sandwiched between the mechanic and the firefighter (clue 13).


This solution satisfies all given constraints, providing a complete table with job-sport pairings.

Lv9-2x6-5	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a solution for the logic puzzle. Here is the completed table:


|         |    1     |    2    |     3     |     4     |    5    |     6     |
| Food    | broccoli | peas   | artichoke | asparagus | corn    | pumpkin   |
| Hobby   | camping  | dancing| puzzles   | drawing   | singing | traveling |

#############

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning:

* From clues 4 and 7, we know that the person with the hobby ""camping"" is on the far left (position 1).
* Clue 6 tells us that the person with the hobby ""dancing"" is between the person with the hobby ""camping"" and the person eating broccoli. Since the person eating broccoli is already in position 1, dancing must be in position 2.
* Clue 13 states that the person eating peas and the person with the hobby ""dancing"" have the same parity positions (i.e., both odd or both even). Therefore, peas must be in an odd-numbered position. The only available odd-numbered position is 3, but clue 9 tells us that asparagus is to the right of artichoke, so peas can't be in position 3. This means peas must be in position 5, and dancing is indeed in position 2.
* Clue 11 places broccoli to the left of camping, which confirms that broccoli is in position 1.
* Clue 10 tells us that corn is to the left of pumpkin, so corn can't be in position 6. The only available positions for corn are 3 or 4. Since asparagus is between artichoke and corn (clue 3), and peas is already in position 5, corn must be in position 4.
* Clue 9 tells us that asparagus is to the right of artichoke. With corn in position 4, asparagus must be in position 5 or 6, but we've already established that peas is in position 5. Therefore, asparagus can't be in position 5, and it must be between artichoke (in position 3) and corn.
* Clue 12 tells us that drawing is to the right of peas, which places drawing in either position 4 or 6. However, clue 14 tells us that drawing is also to the right of artichoke, so drawing can't be in position 4 (since asparagus would be between them). Therefore, drawing must be in position 5 doesn't work, but we've already established peas in position 5), so it must be in position 6, which is taken by traveling. Hence, the only available spot for drawing is position 4.
* Clue 1 tells us that puzzles is to the left or right of corn. Since asparagus is between artichoke and corn, and corn is already in position 4, puzzles must be either in position 3 (artichoke) or position 5 doesn't work since peas is there). This means puzzles is indeed next to corn.
* The only remaining hobby is singing, which can only fit in the remaining available spot: position 5 doesn't work because of peas), so it's placed between dancing and drawing.

The solution was obtained by using the elimination method and logical reasoning. Here is a brief explanation of how I solved it:


First, I identified the most restrictive conditions and tried to place them on the grid.


* The person watching satire movies is not to the left of the person watching zombie movies (1) and the person watching time-travel movies is not to the right of the person watching satire movies (4). This means that Satire must be in position 3 or 4, Zombie in 5 or 6, and Time-travel in 4 or 5.


* The owner of the ferret is somewhere to the left of the person watching zombie movies (6) and the owner of the ferret is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster (13). This means that Ferret must be in position 3 or 4, and Hamster in 4 or 5.


* The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the owner of the hamster (7) and the owner of the ferret is the person watching time-travel movies (14). This means that Time-travel must be in position 5, Ferret in 3 or 4, and Hamster in 4.


* The owner of the frog is somewhere between the person watching animation movies and the person watching satire movies (8) and the owner of the frog is not to the right of the owner of the cat (12). This means that Frog must be in position 5.


* The person watching musical movies is somewhere to the left of the owner of the ferret (9), so Musical must be in position 1 or 2.


* The owner of the bird is between the person watching action movies and the person watching time-travel movies (11) and the owner of the bird is not the person watching time-travel movies (18). This means that Bird must be in position 2.


* The owner of the dog is on the left or right of the person watching zombie movies (16), so Dog must be in position 5 or 6.


By combining these conditions and using elimination, I was able to place all the remaining pets and movie genres.

#############

Explanation:

From clue 2, the person who's sport is water-polo is on the far left or far right. Let's assume they are on the far left for now.

From clue 17, the person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since water-polo is already on the far left, this means baseball must be in position 2, which contradicts our assumption. Therefore, water-polo must be on the far right.

From clue 4, the owner of the bird is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. This means ice-hockey cannot be in positions 5 or 6, since there are no spaces to the right for the bird. Let's place ice-hockey in position 2.

From clue 10, the person who's sport is ice-hockey and the owner of the rat have the same parity positions. Since ice-hockey is in an even position (2), the owner of the rat must also be in an even position. This means the rat cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5.

From clue 13, the person who's sport is rugby is on the right of the owner of the lizard. From clue 14, the owner of the lizard is somewhere between the owner of the fish and the person who's sport is baseball. This means the lizard must be in position 3 or 4.

From clue 8, the person who's sport is swimming is in an odd position. Since the lizard is in either position 3 or 4, swimming cannot be in position 2 (since it would not be to the left of rugby) and cannot be in position 6 (since it would not have any spaces left for the other pets). This means swimming must be in position 1, but we already determined that water-polo is on the far right. Therefore, swimming must be in position 3 or 5.

From clue 11, the person who's sport is swimming is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is rugby. Since swimming cannot be in position 2 and rugby cannot be in position 6 (since it would not have any spaces left for the other pets), this means swimming must be in position 3.

From clue 14, the owner of the lizard is somewhere between the owner of the fish and the person who's sport is baseball. Since the lizard is now in position 4 and swimming is already in position 3, this means the fish must be in position 2 (which we determined earlier that ice-hockey is), which contradicts our assumption. However, if the fish is in position 5, it would not have any spaces left for the other pets.

From clue 7, the person who's sport is rugby is on the right of the person who's sport is swimming. This means rugby must be in position 4 or 5 (since swimming is already in position 3), but we determined earlier that the lizard is in position 4.

Since the lizard is now in position 3, and ice-hockey is also in an even position (2), this means the rat must be in position 6. However, if the rat is in position 6, it would not have any spaces left for water-polo, which we determined earlier to be on the far right.

From clue 10, the person who's sport is ice-hockey and the owner of the rat have the same parity positions. Since ice-hockey is in an even position (2), the owner of the rat must also be in an even position. This means the rat cannot be in position 1 or 5.

From clue 13, the person who's sport is rugby is on the right of the owner of the lizard. If the lizard is now in position 4 and swimming is already in position 3, this means the fish must be in position 2 (which we determined earlier that ice-hockey is), which contradicts our assumption.

From clue 18, the owner of the frog and the person who's sport is weightlifting have different parity positions. This means if the frog is in an odd position, then weightlifting must be in an even position, and vice versa.

Now let's try to place the remaining pets:

* If the frog is in position 1, it would not have any spaces left for swimming.
* If the frog is in position 3, it would contradict our assumption that swimming is already in position 3.
* If the frog is in position 5, then weightlifting must be in an even position. The only remaining even positions are 2 and 4. However, ice-hockey is already in position 2, so weightlifting must be in position 4.

Lv9-2x6-9	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.


From clue 8, we know the owner of the horse is on the far right:


|         |      1      |   2    |    3    |    4    |    5    |    6    |

| Pet     |             |        |         |         |         | horse  |

From clue 9, we know the owner of the turtle is not to the right of the owner of the horse. So, the turtle must be in one of the first five positions.


Clue 5 states that the owner of the goat is somewhere between the person who's hobby is dancing and the person who's hobby is singing. Clue 12 states that the person who's hobby is dancing and the owner of the goat have different parity positions. This means that if the dancer is in an odd position, the goat must be in an even position, and vice versa.


Clue 1 states that the person who's hobby is dancing owns a rat. Clue 4 states that the person who's hobby is dancing is not to the left of the owner of the rat. This means that the dancer must be to the right of the rat owner or in the same position (but we already know from clue 1 that the dancer owns a rat). So, we can conclude that:


|         |      1      |   2    |    3    |    4    |    5    |    6    |

From clue 10, we know the owner of the horse is not to the left of the owner of the goat. This means that the goat must be in one of the first five positions.


Clue 6 states that the person who's hobby is hiking is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.


Clue 11 states that the owner of the rabbit is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.


From clue 16, we know the owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the right of the owner of the turtle. This means that the rabbit must be in one of the last four positions, and the turtle must be in one of the first three positions.


Let's summarize what we have so far:


|         |      1      |   2    |    3    |    4    |    5    |    6    |

| Pet     | Rat/Dancing | Turtle |         | Rabbit  | Goat    | horse  |

From clue 7, we know the owner of the mouse is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is writing.


Clue 15 states that the person who's hobby is writing is not to the left of the owner of the horse. This means that the writer must be in one of the first five positions.


From clue 3, we know the owner of the horse is not to the left of the person who's hobby is dancing.


Clue 2 states that the owner of the goat is not to the right of the person who's hobby is singing. This means that the singer must be in one of the last four positions.


Let's summarize what we have so far:


|         |      1      |   2    |    3    |    4    |    5    |    6    |
| Hobby   | Writing     |        | Wood-   | Hiking  | Singing | Horse  |
| Pet     | Rat/Dancing | Turtle | working | Rabbit  | Goat    | horse  |

From clue 13, we know the person who's hobby is fishing is not to the right of the person who's hobby is singing.


The only position left for the fisher is in position 2. The mouse must be on one side of the writer, so it must be in position 1 (the dancer already has a rat).


Now we have:


|         |      1      |   2    |    3    |    4    |    5    |    6    |

The only hobby left is dancing, which must be in position 4 (the singer already has a goat). But the dancer owns a rat, and there's no room for another pet. So, we need to swap positions 1 and 2:


|         |      1      |   2    |    3    |    4    |    5    |    6    |
| Hobby   | Writing     |        | Wood-   | Hiking  | Singing | Horse  |
| Pet     | Rat/Dancing | Mouse/Turtle | working | Rabbit  | Goat    | horse  |

Now we can place the dancer in position 4, with the rat:


|         |      1      |   2    |    3    |    4    |    5    |    6    |
| Hobby   | Writing     | Fishing| Wood-   | Dancing | Singing | Horse  |
| Pet     | Rat/Dancing| Mouse/Turtle| working | Rat    | Goat    | horse  |

And the turtle must be with the fisher:
