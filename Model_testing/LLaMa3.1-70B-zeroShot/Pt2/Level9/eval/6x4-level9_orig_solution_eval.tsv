Lv9-6x4-2	"Here is the solved puzzle:


|               |    1     |     2      |      3      |      4      |

| Sport         | tennis   | volleyball | rowing      | ice-hockey  |

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

From clue 24, we know that the person watching fantasy movies is the owner of the horse. From clue 2, we know that the owner of the horse is not to the right of the person watching fantasy movies. This means that the person watching fantasy movies and owning the horse must be in position 1.

Clue 10 tells us that the person watching fantasy movies is on the left or right of the fan folk. Since the person watching fantasy movies is already in position 1, the fan folk must be in position 2. Clue 14 confirms this, stating that the fan folk is the person drinking milk.

From clue 15, we know that the person who's sport is ice-hockey is the owner of the guinea-pig. From clue 21, we know that the owner of the guinea-pig is not to the right of the person drinking fanta. This means that the person who's sport is ice-hockey and owns the guinea-pig must be in position 4.

Clue 5 tells us that the owner of the guinea-pig is on the left of the person who drinks fanta. Since the owner of the guinea-pig is already in position 4, the person drinking fanta must be in position 3 or 4. Clue 7 confirms this, stating that the person drinking fanta is the owner of the dog.

From clue 16, we know that the owner of the horse (in position 1) is not the dutch. Clue 9 tells us that the dutch is not to the left of the person drinking cola. This means that the dutch must be in position 4.

However, from clue 13, we know that the nigerian is somewhere to the left of the person drinking fanta (in position 3 or 4). Since the dutch cannot be in position 1 and the nigerian is already on the left side, the dutch must be in position 4.

Clue 26 tells us that the german is not to the left of the person drinking almond-milk. From clue 17, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is somewhere between the person watching drama movies and the mexican. Since the german cannot be on the left side of the person drinking almond-milk, the german must be in position 3.

Clue 25 tells us that the person watching drama movies is on the right of the person who's sport is rowing. From clue 6, we know that the person who's sport is rowing is not to the right of the person drinking milk (in position 2). This means that the person watching drama movies must be in position 3.

From clue 12, we know that the fan country is on the left or right of the fan salsa. Since the fan folk (and thus the fan salsa) is already in position 2, the fan country must be in either position 1 or 3. Clue 11 tells us that the fan country is on the left or right of the fan salsa, so it cannot be in position 1.

Clue 27 tells us that the fan country is not to the left of the fan folk (in position 2). This means that the fan country must be in position 3. Since the person watching drama movies is already in position 3, the fan country must be paired with it.

The only remaining person is the mexican, who must be in position 1. Clue 20 tells us that the mexican is not the person who's sport is rowing. From clue 4, we know that the person who's sport is volleyball is somewhere between the owner of the horse and the german. Since the german is already in position 3, the person who's sport is volleyball must be in either position 2 or 3.

However, from clue 19, we know that the person who's sport is rowing is not to the right of the person drinking fanta (in position 3). This means that the person who's sport is rowing must be in position 2. Since the fan folk is already paired with it, the mexican cannot have a sport.

The only remaining beverage is almond-milk, which must be paired with the mexican. From clue 22, we know that the person watching documentary movies and the owner of the dog (in position 4) have the same parity positions. This means that the person watching documentary movies must be in position 2.

However, from clue 10, we know that the fan folk is paired with the person watching fantasy movies. Since the fan folk is already paired with the person drinking milk, it cannot also be paired with the person watching documentary movies. The only remaining movie-genre is family, which must be paired with the mexican.

Clue 8 tells us that the fan salsa is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies. Since the fan country (and thus the fan salsa) is already in position 3, it cannot also be paired with the person watching documentary movies.

The final solution is:

Note: I used a combination of logical deductions and process of elimination to solve the puzzle. Here's a brief explanation of my thought process:

* From clues 1, 13, and 15, we can deduce that the person who's hobby is puzzles is in position 1, followed by the person who's hobby is fishing, then gardening, and finally skydiving.
* Clue 12 tells us that the person watching horror movies is to the right of the person who's hobby is fishing, which means they must be in position 1.
* Clues 3 and 16 tell us that the owner of the frog is on the left of the person driving the bike, and the owner of the cat is somewhere to the right of the owner of the frog. This implies that the owner of the frog is in position 1 and the owner of the cat is in position 3.
* Clues 7 and 19 tell us that the person driving the bike is between the person who's hobby is fishing and the owner of the frog, which means they must be in position 2.
* And so on...

From condition 14, we know that the person watching family movies is also the person whose hobby is woodworking.


From condition 10, we can deduce that the person watching family movies is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is gardening.


From condition 3, we can infer that the person whose hobby is board-games and the person watching zombie movies have the same parity positions (i.e., both are either at an even position or an odd position).


Using conditions 7 and 26, we know that the fan of R&B and the person whose hobby is woodworking have the same parity positions. Since the person whose hobby is woodworking is also the person watching family movies, we can conclude that the fan of R&B must be on the right side.


From condition 19, we know that the person whose sport is skiing is the fan of Techno.


Using conditions 13 and 8, we can determine that the owner of the rabbit is on the right of the person whose hobby is woodworking, which in turn means that the owner of the rabbit must be at position 4.
