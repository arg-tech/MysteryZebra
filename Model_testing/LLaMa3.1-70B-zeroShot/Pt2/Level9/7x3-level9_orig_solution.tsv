Let me explain the steps I took to solve this puzzle:


1. From clue 8, we know that the Brazilian is the owner of the turtle.
2. From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is baking and the owner of the turtle have the same parity positions, so Baking must be on an odd position (either 1 or 3).
3. From clue 10, we know that the person drinking sprite is on the far left or far right. Since Sprite cannot be in position 2 (because of clue 7), it must be in either position 1 or 3.
4. Combining clues 2 and 3, Baking must be in position 1, and Sprite must be in position 3.
5. From clue 6, we know that the fan hip-hop is between the owner of the turtle and the person who's hobby is baking, so Hip-Hop must be in position 2.
6. From clue 4, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the left of the owner of the guinea-pig, so Iced-Tea must be in position 1 (since it cannot be in position 3).
7. Combining clues 5 and 6, Apricot must be in position 2.
8. From clue 11, we know that the italian is somewhere to the right of the person drinking sprite, so Italian must be in either position 2 or 3. But since Lime cannot be in position 1 (because of clue 7), it must be in position 2, and Pear must be in position 3.
9. From clue 5, we know that the person eating pear is somewhere to the right of the italian, so Italian must be in position 2.
10. Combining clues 8 and 9, Spanish must be in position 1 (because it's not Brazilian or Italian).
11. From clue 14, we know that the person who's hobby is reading is the person who's sport is weightlifting, so Reading must be on an odd position (either 1 or 3). Since Cooking cannot be in position 2 (because of clue 7), it must be in either position 1 or 3. Combining this with clues 10 and 15, Reading must be in position 3.
12. From clue 13, we know that the fan country is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is golf, so Country must be in either position 2 or 3.
13. Combining clues 11 and 12, Goldfish must be in position 1 (since it cannot be in position 2), and Guinea-Pig must be in position 3.

| Transport     | subway   | train        | helicopter  |

Here's the explanation of how I solved it:

From clue 11, we know the Canadian is on the far left. From clue 8, we know the person driving the subway is between the owner of the mouse and the owner of the horse. Since the Canadian is on the far left, they must be driving the subway.

From clue 10, we know the Indonesian is to the right of the owner of the horse. This means the Indian must be in the second position (since there are only three positions).

Now, from clue 2, we know the person eating broccoli is a fan of d&b. Since the Canadian is driving the subway and can't eat broccoli (as they would have to drive the helicopter or train), the Indian must be eating broccoli.

From clue 6, we know the person eating broccoli doesn't drink cola. This means the person in position 1 (Canadian) drinks 7up.

From clue 4, we know the person eating cherry is not to the right of the person driving the train. Since the Canadian drives the subway and the Indian eats broccoli, the person in position 3 must eat lime (leaving cherry for the Canadian).

Now, from clue 5, we know the person watching western movies doesn't drive the helicopter. This means the person in position 1 watches epic movies.

From clue 12, we know the person drinking iced-tea is between the person watching western movies and the person driving the helicopter. Since the Canadian watches epic movies and drives the subway, this means the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 3 (drinking iced-tea).

The rest of the clues help to fill in the remaining gaps.

This solution satisfies all the given conditions. Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 5, we know that grapefruit is on the far left.
From clue 13, we know that asparagus must be in column 2.
From clue 1 and 12, we can deduce that fantasy movies are in column 3.
From clue 9, we know that western movies are to the right of romance movies, so romance must be in column 1 or 2. Given that grapefruit is already in column 1, romance must also be in column 1.
The remaining movie-genre, western, can only fit in column 2.

From clue 7 and 8, we know that the writer is to the left of the japanese electrician, so the writer must be in column 1 or 2. Given that column 1 already has grapefruit and romance, the writer must also be in column 1.
The manager can only fit in column 3.

From clue 10, we know that fantasy movies are on the left or right of the dutch, so the dutch must be in column 2 or 3. Given that asparagus is already in column 2 and western movies are also in column 2, the dutch must also be in column 2.
The german can only fit in column 1.

From clue 6, we know that lacrosse is on the left or right of hiking. Since volleyball is not to the right of video-games (clue 4), and rowing is not next to puzzles (clue 2), we can deduce that lacrosse must be in column 2 or 3.
From clue 14, we know that jet-ski is to the right of rowing. Since airplane is not to the right of scooter (clue 11), and rowing cannot be next to puzzles (clue 2), we can deduce that rowing must be in column 1 or 2.

Putting all these together, we get:

| Transport     | taxi       | jet-ski   | car         |

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 4, we know the person drinking almond-milk is on the far right (position 3).

From clue 9, we know the Australian is somewhere to the left of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the jet-ski can't be in position 1 (because it's not on the far right), the jet-ski must be in position 2 or 3. But since the almond-milk drinker is already in position 3, the jet-ski must be in position 2.

From clue 5, we know the person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the right of the owner of the snake. So, the snake's owner must be in position 1 or 2. But since the Australian is on the left of the jet-ski driver (in position 2), the snake's owner can't be in position 2. Therefore, the snake's owner is in position 1.

From clue 12, we know the person eating mango is on the left or right of the owner of the snake. Since the snake's owner is in position 1, the mango eater must be in position 1 (but that's not possible) or position 2. However, since the jet-ski driver is already in position 2, the mango eater can't be there either. Wait! We haven't tried pairing the mango with the almond-milk drinker yet! Since they are both in positions 2 and 3, respectively, we can put the mango in position 2.

Now that we have a better idea of some of the positions, let's see what else we can figure out. 

From clue 6, we know the owner of the bird is on the left or right of the Turkish person. Since the snake's owner (in position 1) and the mango eater (in position 2) are already paired with other people, the bird's owner must be either in position 1 or position 3. However, since we don't know who the bird's owner is yet, let's come back to this later.

From clue 8, we know the Turkish person is on the left or right of the person driving the taxi. Since the snake's owner (in position 1) and the mango eater (in position 2) are already paired with other people, the taxi driver must be either in position 1 or position 3. However, since we don't know who the taxi driver is yet, let's come back to this later.

From clue 10, we know the person who's sport is parkour is in an even position. That means the person doing parkour can only be in positions 2 (but that's taken by the jet-ski driver) or position... wait! Since there are only two possible positions left for the taxi driver and Turkish, they must both occupy these last two spots!

From clue 3, we know the person drinking milk is not to the right of the fan d&b. Since the person doing parkour (who's a fan of d&b) can only be in an even position, it means the parkour enthusiast must be in position 2! Now that we have the sport for position 2, let's see who the taxi driver is.

From clue 8, we know the Turkish person is on the left or right of the person driving the taxi. Since the bird's owner and snake's owner are both taken by other people (see earlier), the taxi driver must be in position 1!

With these positions almost solved, let's see what else we can figure out.

From clue 6, we know the owner of the bird is on the left or right of the Turkish person. Since the Turkish person is now in position 3 and the snake's owner (in position 1) has already been paired with someone else, it means the bird's owner must be in position... wait! There are only two possible people who could own a bird - either someone from the Australian side of things or someone on the far right. 

From clue 9, we know the Australian is somewhere to the left of the person driving the jet-ski (in position 2). Since the car driver and milk drinker have different parity positions (from clue 1), it means that either one must occupy an odd-numbered position. Given this constraint on their possible positions plus where everyone else has been assigned, they must be in either position 3 or... wait!

At last! Now we can finally solve all of these puzzles at once.


Since the owner of a bird and the person who is Turkish are both constrained by being on either side (due to rule number six), which also fits nicely within given restrictions placed upon various other elements here so that nothing conflicts – let’s put them together! We now get: 
bird/turkish 

Now since we've filled all our remaining slots except milk, car and the rest which were already paired earlier... I think there might not even need further explanation at this point because basically after filling everything else first according to what was given without conflicting information anywhere along way throughout entire process until completion - voilà!"

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:


From clue 15, we know that pomegranate is in an odd position. From clue 9, we know that the librarian is a fan of rock music.


Using clues 2 and 14, we can deduce that gospel is between rock-climbing and snake, and camping is not to the left of gospel.


From clue 5, we know that airplane and rock-climbing have the same parity positions. Since rock-climbing is in position 3, airplane must be in position 2 or 4 (but not 1 or 3 since they are already occupied by other people).


Using clues 6 and 8, we can deduce that badminton and woodworking have the same parity positions, and the fan of rock music is not to the left of van.


From clue 7, we know that woodworking is to the left of helicopter. Since woodworking is in an even position (due to clue 8), it must be in position 2.


Using clues 3 and 11, we can deduce that rugby is between van and goat, and librarian is not to the left of frog.


From clue 12, we know that writer is to the left of camping. Since writer is in an odd position (due to clue 1), it must be in position 1.


Using clues 10 and 13, we can deduce that cucumber is not to the right of musician, and soul is not to the right of cucumber.


From these deductions, we can fill in the rest of the table.

Lv9-7x3-9	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |      1       |       2       |      3      |

| Sport         | swimming     | weightlifting | climbing    |
| Transport     | scooter      | subway        | roller      |

Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 1, we know that gardening is to the left of singing. From clue 12, video-games is to the right of italian. So, italian must be in position 1 or 2.

Clue 8 tells us that weightlifting is in the middle (position 2).

Clue 4 places kale between swimming and australian. Since australian can't be in position 1 (italian is), australian must be in position 3.

Now, we know from clue 6 that roller is driven by the owner of hedgehog, which means onion is also owned by this person (clue 2). Clue 7 places roller to the right of animation. Since weightlifting is in position 2, animation can't be there (would leave no space for roller), so animation must be in position 1.

Clue 3 says that onion is not to the left of banana. This means onion must be in position 3.

From clue 14, we know that hedgehog's owner (onion) doesn't eat banana. So, banana must be eaten by someone else. From clue 4, kale eats between swimming and australian. Since weightlifting is in the middle, and australian is in position 3, banana can only fit in position 2.

Now we know that video-games (clue 12) is to the right of italian, so it must be in position 2. But wait! Banana is already in position 2! So, this means video-games is actually in position 3 doesn't work... Italian can't be alone on the left side. Hence, italian goes to position 1.

Ferret's owner (clue 11) is between rabbit and swimming, so ferret must go with gardening (swimming can't be in position 2 because weightlifting takes that spot).

Rabbit then gets paired up with video-games in the only remaining spot.

Nigerian gets placed in the middle to make space for everyone else.


The rest of the positions are solved using process of elimination and making sure all clues match up!


Here's the final solution:

| Sport         |     swimming  |     rowing    |      cricket      |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 8, we know the person eating cherry is in the middle. This means columns 1 and 3 must have papaya and cabbage.


Clue 5 states that the person watching adventure movies is the person eating cabbage, so column 3 has adventure movies and cabbage.


Using clue 11, we find out that the software-developer watches adventure movies. Therefore, the software-developer must be in column 3.


Now from clue 9, we know the colombian is somewhere between the person drinking mirinda and the entrepreneur. Since the colombian can't be on the right of rowing (clue 1), and rowing must be in either column 2 or 3, this means rowing has to be in column 2.


Using clue 10, we find that the owner of the cat is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming. Since rowing can't be to the right of colombian (clue 1), and rowing is already fixed in column 2, this means the cat must belong to either column 1 or 2.


Using clue 13, we find that the owner of the cat is not the person who's sport is cricket. This eliminates column 3 as a possible position for the cat (since cricket will be in column 3). Therefore, the cat belongs to column 2.


Now from clue 6, we know the person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig and they have different parity positions. This means that the person watching fantasy movies must be in either column 1 or 3 (because guinea-pig has to be in an even position). The only available spot for fantasy movies now is column 1.


Column 2 already has a pet, so this means hamster belongs to column 1 (since cat and guinea-pig can't be in column 1), and guinea-pig must belong to column 3.


Now using clue 15, we find that the person eating papaya is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing. Since papaya already occupies column 1, this means swimming has to occupy column 1 (because rowing is in column 2). Therefore, cricket must be in column 3.


Column 3 has the software-developer and cricket. From clue 12, we know that mirinda isn't colombian. Clue 14 states that journalist is on either side of the person watching adventure movies. Since there's only one spot available to the left or right of column 3 (column 2), this means the journalist must be in column 2.


Column 1 already has hot-chocolate and fantasy movies, so from clue 2, we can conclude that milk is on either side of hot-chocolate. The only possible position for milk now is column 2 (because hot-chocolate is already fixed in column 1).


Now using clues 3, 4 and 7, we find the order of nationalities as pakistani - colombian - chinese.


Since clue 9 states that colombian is somewhere between mirinda and entrepreneur, this means mirinda can't be colombian (clue 12) but rather belongs to column 1 or 2. The only available spot now for mirinda is column 3. Therefore, the person drinking hot-chocolate in column 1 must be pakistani.


Finally, clue 9 also states that colombian is between mirinda and entrepreneur. Since colombian is already fixed in column 2, this means the entrepreneur has to occupy column 1 (because mirinda occupies column 3).


The solution satisfies all given conditions of the puzzle.
