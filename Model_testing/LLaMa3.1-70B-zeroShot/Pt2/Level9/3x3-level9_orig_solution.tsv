Lv9-3x3-1	"I'll guide you through solving this puzzle step by step.

First, let's break down the clues:

1. The Dutch person is either at position 1 or 3.
2. The artichoke eater is between the jazz fan and the cucumber eater.
3. The house music fan and the Brazilian are not in positions next to each other (i.e., they don't share an edge).
4. The artichoke eater is to the right of the Dutch person.
5. The pop music fan is to the right of the jazz music fan.

Now, let's start filling out the table based on these clues:

**Step 1: Apply clue 1 and clue 4**
Given that the Dutch person must be at position 1 (since if they were at position 3, there would be no space for the artichoke eater to be to their right), we can tentatively place them at position 1.

|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |
| Food          |           |           |          |
| Music-Genre   |           |           |          |
| Nationality   | Dutch     |           |          |

**Step 2: Apply clue 2 and clue 5**
Considering the artichoke eater is between the jazz fan and the cucumber eater, and knowing the pop music fan must be to the right of the jazz music fan, we can deduce a possible arrangement for positions 2 and 3:

|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |
| Food          |           | Artichoke | Cucumber |
| Music-Genre   |           | Jazz      | Pop      |
| Nationality   | Dutch     |           |          |

**Step 3: Apply clue 3**
Since the house music fan cannot be next to the Brazilian (due to parity), and knowing our current setup, we must place the house music fan at position 1. This means the Brazilian can only be at position 2.

|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |
| Food          |           | Artichoke | Cucumber |
| Music-Genre   | House     | Jazz      | Pop      |
| Nationality   | Dutch     | Brazilian|          |

**Step 4: Finalize based on the remaining clues and options**
Given that the artichoke eater must be between the jazz fan and the cucumber eater, our setup in step 3 satisfies this condition. The only nationality left is Russian, which can only fit at position 3.

The food not assigned yet (cranberry) must then go to the Dutch person at position 1.

**Final Solution**

Lv9-3x3-2	"After solving the logic puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


|               |      1      |    2    |    3    |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Fantasy | Romance |
| Nationality   | Egyptian    | Mexican | Chinese  |
| Transport     | Roller      | Bus     | Scooter  |

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

1. From clue 2, we know the Egyptian watches documentary movies.
2. From clue 3, we know the Egyptian is on the left or right of the person watching fantasy movies.
3. From clue 5, we know the person driving the roller is in position 1 (since there's no other information about the roller).
4. Combining clues 2 and 3, the Egyptian must be in position 1, watching documentary movies, with the person watching fantasy movies on their right.
5. Clue 6 tells us the Chinese is between the Egyptian and the person driving the scooter. Since the Egyptian is in position 1, the Chinese must be in position 3, with the person driving the scooter also in position 3 (but we'll get to that later).
6. From clue 4, we know the Egyptian (in an odd-numbered position) has the same parity as the person driving the scooter (which means the person driving the scooter is also in an odd-numbered position). This confirms our previous conclusion that the Chinese and the scooter are in position 3.
7. Clue 7 tells us the person watching romance movies and the person driving the roller have different parity positions. Since the roller is in position 1 (an odd number), the romance movie watcher must be in an even-numbered position, which means they're in position 2.
8. Finally, from clue 1, we know the Mexican isn't to the left of the fantasy movie watcher, so the Mexican must be watching fantasy movies.

And that's how we arrive at the final solution!

Lv9-3x3-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.


From clue 2, we know that the mechanic and the goldfish owner have the same parity positions (i.e., either both are in odd-numbered positions or both are in even-numbered positions). Since there are only three people, this means that the mechanic and the goldfish owner must be in positions 1 and 3, in some order.


From clue 1, we know that the mechanic is to the right of the scientist. This means that the scientist cannot be in position 3 (since the mechanic would then have to be to their right, but there's no one else to the right). Therefore, the scientist must be in either position 1 or 2.


From clue 4, we know that the scientist is not to the left of the owner of the rat. This means that if the scientist were in position 1, the rat owner would have to be in position 1 as well (which is impossible). Therefore, the scientist must be in position 2.


Now we can use clue 3, which tells us that the ferret owner is in the middle (i.e., position 2). But we already know that the scientist is in position 2! This means that the scientist and the ferret owner are actually the same person.


From clue 5, we know that the epic movie fan is between the rat owner and the romance movie fan. Since there are only three people, this means that the epic movie fan must be in position 2 (which we already determined belongs to the scientist/ferret owner). Therefore, the scientist/ferret owner watches epic movies.


From clue 6, we know that the epic movie fan is not to the right of the rat owner. This means that the rat owner cannot be in position 1, since the epic movie fan (in position 2) would then be to their right. Therefore, the rat owner must be in position 3.


Now we can use clue 7, which tells us that the scientist is not to the right of the rat owner. But we already know that the scientist is in position 2 and the rat owner is in position 3! This means that the photographer must be in position 1 (since they're the only one left), and the goldfish owner must also be in position 1.


Finally, let's look at the movie genres. We already determined that the epic movie fan is the scientist/ferret owner in position 2. The rat owner in position 3 cannot watch romance movies (since the epic movie fan would then be to their right), so they must watch animation movies. This leaves the photographer/goldfish owner in position 1 watching romance movies.


Here's the completed table:

Lv9-3x3-4	"I'll solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 5, we know that the person driving the subway is between the person eating pear and the person driving the van. This means the person eating pear must be in position 1 or 2.

From clue 1, we know that the person watching disaster movies and the person eating pear have the same parity positions (i.e., both odd or both even). If the person eating pear is in position 1, then the person watching disaster movies must also be in an odd position. However, this would put them to the right of the person driving the ship (clue 6), which is not possible. Therefore, the person eating pear must be in position 2.

Now we know that the person driving the subway is in position 1 or 3 (clue 5). If they are in position 3, then the person watching scientific movies would have to be in an odd position (clue 4), but this would put them to the right of the person driving the van (clue 2), which is not possible. Therefore, the person driving the subway must be in position 1.

From clue 7, we know that the person watching drama movies and the person driving the van have different parity positions. Since the person driving the van is in an odd position (3), the person watching drama movies must be in an even position (2). But the person eating pear is already in position 2! Therefore, the person watching drama movies must be in position 2, and the person eating pear must be watching drama movies.

The only movie genre left for position 1 is scientific. The person driving the subway is in position 1, so they are watching scientific movies.

Now we can fill in the food: kale (clue 3) and spinach are the remaining options. Kale must be to the right of the van driver, so it goes in position 3. Spinach is left over for position 1.

Finally, disaster movies go with pear, which means the person eating pear watches disaster movies.

Here's the solution table:

Lv9-3x3-5	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 3, we know the pakistani is on the left of the person driving the bus.

From clue 2, we know the person driving the roller is on the left of the person driving the bus. Combining this with clue 3, we get: pakistani -> roller -> bus

From clue 6, we know the person driving the bus is the nigerian.

So far, we have:

|               |      1      |       2       |    3     |
| Job           |             |               |          |
| Nationality   | Pakistani   | Roller        | Nigerian  |
| Transport     |             | Roller        | Bus       |

From clue 5, we know the person driving the roller is on the right of the electrician. Therefore, the electrician must be in position 1.

|               |      1      |       2       |    3     |

| Nationality   | Pakistani   | Roller        | Nigerian  |
| Transport     |             | Roller        | Bus       |

From clue 4, we know the social-worker is not to the left of the pakistani. Therefore, the social-worker must be in position 3.

|               |      1      |       2       |    3     |

| Transport     |             | Roller        | Bus       |

From clue 7, we know the pakistani and the pilot have different parity positions. Since the pakistani is in position 1 (odd), the pilot must be in an even position, i.e., position 2.

|               |      1      |       2       |    3     |

| Nationality   | Pakistani   | Roller        | Nigerian  |
| Transport     |             | Roller        | Bus       |

From clue 9, we know the person driving the bus is not the electrician. We already knew this, but it confirms that the electrician drives something other than the bus.

From clue 1, we know the dutch and the social-worker have different parity positions. Since the social-worker is in position 3 (odd), the dutch must be in an even position, i.e., position 2 is taken by the pilot, so the dutch must be in a different table cell... actually, this means that the dutch is not a possibility for column 2 and therefore must be in column 1. So we swap the pakistani with the dutch.

From clue 1, we know that the British person is either in position 1 or position 2 (since they have the same parity positions as the person driving the car).

From clue 5, we know that the Indonesian person is in an even position, which means they can be in either position 2.

Let's start by placing the Indonesian person in position 2.

From clue 2, we know that the person driving the car is to the right of the person who's sport is badminton. Since the Indonesian person is in position 2, the person driving the car must be in position 3.


|               |     1     |     2      |      3       |

| Transport     | Bus        |            | Car          |

From clue 1, we know that the British person is either in position 1 or position 2. But since the Indonesian person is already in position 2, the British person must be in position 1.

From clue 3, we know that the Japanese person is to the right of the person who's sport is soccer. Since the British person is in position 1, the person who's sport is soccer must be in position 1 (British), and the Japanese person must be in position 2 or 3.

But since the Indonesian person is already in position 2, the Japanese person must be in position 3.

From clue 2, we know that the person driving the car is to the right of the person who's sport is badminton. Since the person driving the car is in position 3 (Japanese), and the Japanese person is already there, the person who's sport is badminton must be in position 1 or 2.

But since the British person is already in position 1, the person who's sport is badminton must be in position 1 (British).

Finally, from clue 3, we know that the person who's sport is soccer must be to the left of the Japanese person. Since the Japanese person is in position 3, the person who's sport is soccer must be in position 1 or 2.

But since the British person is already in position 1 with badminton, the person who's sport is soccer must be in position 2 (Indonesian).

Lv9-3x3-8	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############

| Food          | Peach      | Pepper    | Lettuce   |
| Job           | Social-Worker| Electrician | Project-Manager|
| Music-Genre   | Gospel     | House     | Indie     |
#############


Let's break down the reasoning:

From clue 7, we know the person eating pepper is in the middle, so Pepper goes in column 2.

From clue 5, the fan of gospel and the person eating lettuce have the same parity positions. This means they are either both in odd-numbered columns or both in even-numbered columns. Since the person eating peach can't be to the right of the indie fan (clue 1), Peach goes in column 1.

From clue 3, the project-manager is not a fan of house music. From clue 6, the fan of house music is between the fan of indie and the electrician. Since the electrician can't be in column 1 (due to clue 2), the Electrician goes in column 2 or 3. The Project-Manager must then go in column 3.

Now we have:

|               |      1      |       2       |        3        |

| Job           |             | Electrician | Project-Manager|

From clue 4, the fan of house music is not to the left of the person eating lettuce. This means Lettuce goes in column 3.

Finally, from clue 8, the fan of house music is somewhere to the right of the fan of gospel music. This means Gospel goes in column 1.

The final solution table:

Lv9-3x3-9	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a possible solution for the logic puzzle:


#############
|            |     1     |     2      |    3     |
| Beverage   | Fanta    | Cola       | Soy-milk |
| Food       | Pineapple| Kiwi        | Lemon     |
| Pet        | Pony     | Guinea-pig | Goldfish |
#############

Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 5, we know that cola is on the right of pineapple. Since there are only three positions, this means pineapple must be in position 1.

Clue 4 tells us that cola and guinea-pig have the same parity positions. This implies that either both are in odd-numbered positions (1 or 3) or both are in even-numbered positions (2). Given the constraint from clue 5, we can conclude that cola is in position 2.

Now, looking at clue 2, we know that soy-milk is on the right of kiwi. Since cola is already in position 2, and soy-milk cannot be to its left, soy-milk must be in position 3. This means kiwi must be in position 2, but wait! We've already placed cola there. So, we swap cola with pineapple's food partner (kiwi isn't it), and get lemon as the food for position 3.

The only pet left is goldfish, which goes to position 3.

The remaining pet-pair is pony and guinea-pig. Given clue 4, guinea-pig must be in an even-numbered position (2), so we place it there. Pony then goes to position 1.

Lastly, the beverage left is fanta, which we place in position 1.

This solution satisfies all the given clues."

From clue 3, we know the order of transport is: boat, ship, scooter (left to right).

From clue 1, we can conclude that the person driving the scooter cannot be on position 1, because there would be no one on their left. So, the scooter must be at either position 2 or 3.

Now, let's analyze the movie-genre and pet information.


Considering clue 2, if the animation movies fan is at an odd-numbered position (1 or 3), the bird owner must be at an even-numbered position (2). But then, according to clue 4, the superhero movies fan would also need to be at an even-numbered position (2), which means they couldn't be to the right of the goldfish owner (clue 5).


Therefore, the animation movies fan must be at an even-numbered position. This leaves only one possibility for the bird owner's parity: odd.


Now, combining this information with clue 1, we can conclude that the scooter driver is on position 2 and the bird owner is on position 1 or 3 (odd). However, since the superhero movies fan needs to be to the right of the goldfish owner (clue 5), the only possible arrangement for these two is:


...bird owner (position 1) - goldfish owner (position 2) - superhero movies fan (position 3)


This forces the animation movies fan to position 2. Combining this with our earlier conclusions, we can now fill in the rest of the table:


|               |     1     |   2    |     3     |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy    | Animation| Superhero|
| Pet           | Bird      | Goldfish| Dog      |
| Transport     | Boat      | Ship    | Scooter  |

So, here is the completed table with '#############' around it:
