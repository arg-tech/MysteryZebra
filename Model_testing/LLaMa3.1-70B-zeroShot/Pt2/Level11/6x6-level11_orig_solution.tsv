| Transport     | airplane    | taxi       | motorbike  | van          | bus          | trike      |

 Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* First, I identified the most restrictive clues and started by filling in the information from those.
* Clue 20 helped establish that the person driving the airplane is either the fan trance or has rugby as their sport. This, combined with clue 1, allowed me to place the musical movie genre on column 6.
* Clues 23 and 25 established the connection between tennis and ambient music, as well as water-polo and trike transport.
* I then used clues 4, 10, and 30 to determine the position of mirinda and motorbike.
* The rest of the puzzle fell into place by using a combination of the remaining clues.
