Please note that this solution satisfies all the given conditions and constraints.


#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:

* From clue 1, we know that the fan of Trance is either eating Apricot or driving the Bus.
* Clue 23 helps us to place the owner of the Goldfish on the left of the person driving the Subway. Since the person eating Apricot can't be to the left of the owner of the Goldfish (clue 11), we conclude that the person eating Apricot must drive the Subway or own the Goldfish.
* Clues 3 and 33 help us to place the person eating Apricot on either side of the owner of the Frog. Since the owner of the Goldfish is already placed, we can conclude that the person eating Apricot owns the Goldfish (clue 36).
* We use similar logic to figure out the rest of the placements.
