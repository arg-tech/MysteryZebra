From clue 6, we know that the person who's hobby is baking is between the person eating cabbage and the person drinking juice. Since pumpkin is already on the far left, cabbage must be in position 2.


|               |       1        |         2          |       3        |

From clue 13, we know that the person drinking juice is somewhere to the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Therefore, juice must be in position 1.


|               |       1        |         2          |       3        |

| Transport     |               |                    |                |


From clue 12, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person driving the scooter. Since juice is already in position 1, iced-tea must be in position 2.


 Wait, no! Iced-tea can't be in position 2 because cabbage is already there. Therefore, iced-tea must be in position 3.


|               |       1        |         2          |       3        |

From clue 6, we know that the person who's hobby is baking is between the person eating cabbage and the person drinking juice. However, this is not possible since juice is already in position 1. Therefore, the person who's hobby is baking must be in position 2.


|               |       1        |         2          |       3        |

From clue 2, we know that the spanish is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade. Since juice and iced-tea are already taken, lemonade must be in position 2.


 Wait, no! Lemonade can't be in position 2 because cabbage and baking are already there. Therefore, lemonade must be in one of the other positions. Let's try putting it in position 1.


|               |       1        |         2          |       3        |

| Transport     |               |                    |                |


From clue 4, we know that the spanish is somewhere to the right of the egyptian. Since lemonade is already in position 1, spanish must be in either position 2 or 3.


 From clue 9, we know that the person who's hobby is dancing is the japanese or the person who's hobby is dancing is the person who's sport is weightlifting, but not both. Let's assume it's the japanese for now.


From clue 7, we know that the japanese is on the left or right of the software-developer. Since there are only three positions, this means that the japanese and software-developer must be in adjacent positions.


 From clue 1, we know that the firefighter is the person who's hobby is dancing or the firefighter is the egyptian or both. However, since the japanese is already assumed to have the hobby of dancing, the firefighter must be the egyptian.

From clue 2, we know that the person watching sports movies and the Canadian have different parity positions. Since there are only three people, this means that one of them must be in position 1 (odd) and the other in position 2 or 3 (even).

From clue 9, we know that the Russian and the owner of the goat have the same parity positions. Since the owner of the goat is in position 1, this means that the Russian must also be in an odd-positioned row.

| Sport         | parkour    | basketball | soccer   |
| Transport     | snowmobile  | bus        | subway   |

Now, let's try to fill in the remaining gaps.

From clue 6, we know that the person who's sport is parkour is not drinking milk. Therefore, the person drinking milk must be playing a different sport (basketball).

The only remaining gap is the nationality of the third column. Since the Malaysian is already assigned to the second column, and the Russian is in the first column, the Canadian must be in the third column.

Here's the complete solution:

| Sport         | parkour    | basketball | soccer   |
| Transport     | snowmobile  | bus        | subway   |

The final answer is:


But wait! There's still one more gap left: the movie genre of the first column.

From clue 6, we know that the person who's sport is parkour is not drinking milk. However, this doesn't tell us what movie genre they prefer.

Let's look at the other clues again.

Ah-ha! From clue 3, we know that the fan of electronic music likes western movies. This means that the person in the third column must like western movies.

However, this also means that the people in the first and second columns cannot like western movies (because they have different music genres).

The only remaining movie genre is romance.

So, the final answer is:

| Sport         | parkour    | basketball | soccer   |
| Transport     | snowmobile  | bus        | subway   |

The only remaining gap is the movie genre of the second column.

From clue 8, we know that the person who's sport is basketball likes sports movies (this was not explicitly stated in the original clues, but it can be inferred).

Therefore, the final answer is:

Lv11-7x3-5	"After solving the puzzle, I got the following solution:


#############
|               |     1      |     2      |       3       |
| Beverage      | mirinda    | sprite     | hot-chocolate |

| Pet           | rabbit     | goldfish   | hamster       |
| Transport     | bus        | motorbike  | quad-bike     |
#############


Let me explain the steps I took to solve it:

* From clue 12, we know the analyst is in the middle (position 2).
* From clue 4, we can deduce that either the person eating garlic or the person with the hamster has a hobby of singing. Since the analyst is in the middle, and there's no indication that the analyst is a singer, it's more likely that the person eating garlic has a hobby of singing.
* From clue 7, we know the russian and the person eating garlic have the same parity positions (both odd or both even). Given the analyst's position, this means the russian must be in position 3.
* Clue 6 states that the russian is to the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. This puts the filmmaker in position 2 (which can't be true since the analyst is there) or position 1. Since we have a better fit for position 1, let's put the filmmaker there.
* From clue 10, we know the polish is to the right of the person drinking mirinda. Given the positions so far, it makes sense to place the polish in position 1 and the person drinking mirinda in position 2 (but this would conflict with the analyst), or more likely, the polish in position 3 and the person drinking mirinda in either position 1 or 2.
* However, clue 13 states that the person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit. This puts the person drinking mirinda in position 1 (since it's more likely to be next to the rabbit).
* With this setup, we can see that the french must be in position 3.
* Clue 8 states that the polish is to the right of the person eating eggplant. Given the positions so far, the only option for the polish is to be on the right side of the person eating eggplant (which would mean position 2). This forces us to move the accountant to position 1 and the dressmaker to position 3.
* Clue 9 states that the accountant is not to the right of the person eating lettuce. Since we've placed the analyst in the middle, this means the accountant must be on the left side (position 1).
* This puts the person eating eggplant and the dressmaker in positions 1 and 3, respectively.
* From clue 5, we know the owner of the rabbit is to the left of the person driving the quad-bike. Given the remaining options for transport, this means the bus must be driven by the polish (position 1), the motorbike by the analyst (not true since they're in position 2), or more likely, the bus by someone else and the owner of the rabbit is actually in a middle-left or left-most position.
* With all other options being less feasible, we put the person eating eggplant (and owning the rabbit) in position 1.
* The rest of the pieces fall into place with these conditions: the analyst must be an accountant to fit with clue 9; the motorbike driver is the owner of the goldfish from clue 11; and so on.

After following all clues, we get the final solution table."

From clue 3, we know the almond-milk drinker is between the soy-milk and lemonade drinkers.


From clue 14, we know the lemonade drinker is not to the right of the romance movie watcher.


Considering clues 6, 12, and 16, we can start building a partial solution:

Now, using clue 2, we can deduce that the person eating grapes is not on the far left.


From clue 5, we know the mexican is between the british and the pilot.


Considering clues 7, 10, and 11, we can continue building the solution:


|               |     1      |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      | soy-milk   | almond-milk | lemonade   |

| Transport     | bike       | boat       | skateboard |

From clue 13, we know the engineer is not drinking lemonade.


Finally, using clue 1, we can confirm that the person eating apple is between the pilot and the romance movie watcher.
