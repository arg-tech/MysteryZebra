Lv11-7x4-2	"Here is the final solution:


|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |      4      |

| Movie-Genre   | spy         | thriller    | romance    | animation|
| Nationality   | egyptian   | australian  | british    | thai      |
| Pet           | lizard     | guinea-pig | cat       | goldfish  |
| Transport     | quad-bike  | tram        | trike     | motorbike |

 

Here's the explanation:

From statement 5, we know that the person driving the quad-bike and the owner of the lizard have the same parity positions. Statement 15 also tells us that the owner of the lizard is on the far left or far right. Since there can't be two odd-numbered positions (far left) for these people, they must both occupy even-numbered positions.

Statement 4 tells us that the person driving the quad-bike is the bartender, so we place them in position 1. The owner of the lizard also has to be on an even number, and since position 2 is taken by the chef (statement 24), the lizard must belong to the person in position 1.

Now, let's look at statement 28: ""the thai is not the person drinking fanta"". From this, we can conclude that the thai drinks either soy-milk or milk. 

Statement 22 tells us that the person watching romance movies is the person drinking milk or the person watching romance movies is the thai or both1. Since we know from statement 14 that the person watching thriller movies drinks soy-milk, it's more likely that the thai drinks soy-milk and watches a different genre.

However, if the thai drank soy-milk, statement 24 (""the thai is the chef or the thai is the person drinking soy-milk or both1"") would imply that the thai must also be the chef. But then the chef (who's in position 2) couldn't drink milk as stated in 22.

Therefore, we deduce that the thai watches romance movies and drinks milk. We place them at position 4.


Statement 14 tells us that the person drinking soy-milk is watching thriller movies. This puts the person who drinks soy-milk in either position 2 or 3 (from statement 10). 

Since the australian can't be to the left of the person driving the trike (17), and we have a candidate for the trike driver on position 3, let's place the australian at position 3. This puts them watching thriller movies and drinking soy-milk.

The fanta drinker is either at position 1 or 2 since they can't be at position 4 (the thai) and there are no other places left for them.


Now let's look at statement 27: ""the person driving the tram is on the right of the person driving the trike"". This tells us that we have an order: person driving the trike, then the person driving the tram. We already know from statement 26 that the person driving the tram is either the pilot or owns a goldfish (or both). The only job not taken yet is the lawyer, so this puts them in position 2.


From statement 16 (""the person watching animation movies is not the lawyer""), we can put the person who watches animations at position 3. This also makes sense with the order stated in statement 27.

However, there's a conflict: if the person driving the trike and the tram are next to each other (as per statement 27), then either position 2 or 3 has to be empty for the person watching animation movies.


Let's assume we put the person watching animation at position 3 as stated earlier. This forces us to have an empty slot between the tram driver and the trike driver.

But if we place the animation fan on position 1 (thereby making them next to either the trike or the tram), it creates a gap, which is disallowed by statement 29 (""the person watching animation movies is somewhere between the australian and the chef"").


The only way for this order to be maintained without any gaps would be if the australian was on position 2 (watching thriller movies) and the chef on position 4. However, we already placed the thai at position 4 because they had to drink milk.

Hence we need to revisit some of these deductions.


From statement 29 (""the person watching animation movies is somewhere between the australian and the chef""), we know that there are only three possible places where this can be true: positions 1-3. And since statements 10, 16 tell us that the soy-milk drinker watches thriller or romance (and hence isn't an animator) - statement 14 says they watch thrillers), it must be either on position 2 or 3.


We already decided from statement 24 and 22 that the thai watched romance movies. Therefore, we can safely place them at position 4 since they drink milk.

The chef (now on position 2) will have to drink a different beverage than soy-milk because of this.


Now we see that if we put the person who watches animation movies on position 1 and fanta on 3 as stated earlier, it disallows a possible conflict with statement 14."

####################

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* From clue 4, we know that the person watching disaster movies is on the far left.
* Clue 2 tells us that the person watching romance movies is in an odd position. Since there are only four positions, this means that the person watching romance movies must be either in position 1 or 3. However, since clue 4 states that the person watching disaster movies is on the far left, we can conclude that the person watching romance movies is actually in position 3.
* Clue 6 tells us that the person who's sport is cycling is the person watching epic movies.
* From clue 13, we know that the owner of the frog and the person watching epic movies have the same parity positions. Since the person watching epic movies is in an even position (position 2 or 4), this means that the owner of the frog must also be in an even position.
* Clue 14 tells us that the owner of the frog is the person eating plum or the person watching romance movies is the owner of the frog, or both. Since we already know that the person watching romance movies is in position 3, and the person eating plum can't be in position 3 (since clue 21 states that the person eating plum is between the owner of the guinea-pig and the person eating apple), this means that the owner of the frog must be in position 4.
* From clue 16, we know that the owner of the frog is somewhere to the left of the british. Since the owner of the frog is in position 4, this means that the british must be in either position 3 or 4. However, since clue 7 states that the british is in an odd position, we can conclude that the british is actually in position 3.
* Clue 20 tells us that the person driving the skateboard is on the left or right of the russian. Since the russian is already placed in position 2 (based on clue 24), this means that the person driving the skateboard must be in either position 1 or 3. However, since clue 17 states that the person watching family movies and the person driving the skateboard have different parity positions, we can conclude that the person driving the skateboard is actually in position 3.
* Clue 21 tells us that the person eating plum is between the owner of the guinea-pig and the person eating apple. Since we already know that the owner of the frog (who eats plum) is in position 4, this means that the owner of the guinea-pig must be in either position 1 or 2, and the person eating apple must be in either position 3 or 4.
* Clue 22 tells us that the person eating grapes is on the left of the person driving the taxi. Since we already know that the person driving the skateboard is in position 3, this means that the person driving the taxi must be in position 2 or 4. However, since clue 11 states that the person driving the taxi is not the person watching romance movies, we can conclude that the person driving the taxi is actually in position 2.
* Clue 23 tells us that the pakistani is either the person who's sport is weightlifting or the person driving the skateboard. Since we already know that the person driving the skateboard is in position 3, and the person who's sport is weightlifting can't be in position 3 (since clue 6 states that the person who's sport is cycling is the person watching epic movies), this means that the pakistani must be the person who's sport is weightlifting.
* Clue 25 tells us that the fan blues is not to the left of the person eating peas. Since we already know that the person eating pea is in position 2, this means that the fan blues must be in either position 3 or 4.

By combining all these clues and making some logical deductions, I was able to arrive at the final solution table above."

| Transport     | train       | airplane   | van        | snowmobile |

 Here's the explanation of the solution:

The key to solving this puzzle was to use a combination of logical deductions and process of elimination. I started by identifying the most restrictive clues, such as clue 19 (the fan rock is in an even position) and clue 30 (the person eating plum is between the australian and the owner of the hedgehog).

Using these clues, I was able to determine that the person eating plum must be in position 3. Then, using clue 1, I determined that the dutch must be to the right of the person eating plum.

Next, I used clue 10 to determine that the person driving the airplane is either drinking lemonade or is the german. Since the german cannot own a chinchilla (clue 9), the german must be driving the airplane and drinking lemonade.

Using clue 12, I determined that the person driving the train must be between the person drinking milk and the fan country. Then, using clue 23, I determined that the owner of the snake must be to the right of the person driving the snowmobile.

The rest of the solution fell into place by using a combination of clues and logical deductions.

* Clue 24 allowed me to place the person drinking hot-chocolate in either column 2 or column 1. Since the german is already in column 1, I temporarily placed the person drinking hot-chocolate in column 2.
* With clue 10, I placed the italian and the person eating watermelon in columns with the same parity (either both odd or both even). Given that the person eating watermelon is already in column 3, I placed the italian in either column 1 or column 3. However, since the german is already in column 1, I temporarily placed the italian in column 3.
* Clue 18 allowed me to place the journalist and the fan soul in columns with the same parity (either both odd or both even).
* Using clue 25, I placed the person drinking hot-chocolate on either side of the bus driver. Given that the german is already in column 1, I temporarily placed the person drinking hot-chocolate in column 2.
* Clue 20 allowed me to place the manager somewhere to the left of the tram driver (column 4). With clue 27, I placed the manager on the left side of the lemon eater. Given that the lemon eater is already in column 4, I temporarily placed the manager in column 3.
* Using clues 5 and 29, I swapped the italian with the person eating watermelon to satisfy both conditions.
* With clue 11, I placed the person eating pepper on either side of the water drinker. Given that the person drinking hot-chocolate is already in column 2, I temporarily placed the person eating pepper in column 1.
* Clue 12 allowed me to place the mechanic as a fan of metal or driving the train (column 3). However, since the italian is already in column 3, I placed the mechanic in column 2.
* Using clue 17, I swapped the russian with the skateboard driver to satisfy both conditions.
* Clue 9 allowed me to place the person eating pepper and the hiker on either side of each other. Given that the person drinking hot-chocolate is already in column 2, I placed the hiker in column 3.
