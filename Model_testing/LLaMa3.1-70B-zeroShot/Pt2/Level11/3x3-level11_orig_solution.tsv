Lv11-3x3-1	"Let's break down the clues step by step:

From clue 3, we know the Japanese person is the lawyer.

From clue 2, we know the Colombian is between the Japanese and the owner of the snake. This means the order must be: Japanese, Colombian, Snake owner (or Snake owner, Japanese, Colombian).

From clue 1, we know the Mexican is to the left of the engineer. This doesn't give us much information yet.

From clue 4, we know that either the Japanese person is the engineer or the owner of the rat is the engineer (or both). But since the Japanese person is already the lawyer (from clue 3), it must be the case that the owner of the rat is the engineer.

Now let's put together what we have so far:

|               |    1    |     2     |    3     |
| Job           |         | Lawyer   |          |
| Nationality   | Mexican | Colombian| Japanese |
| Pet           |         |          |          |

We still don't know the order of the pets or the job of person 1 and 3. But we can make some educated guesses.

Since the owner of the snake is either person 2 or 3, and person 3 is already occupied by being Japanese, it's likely that person 2 (Colombian) owns the snake.

As for person 1 (Mexican), they must be to the left of the engineer (person 3). Since person 3 is not yet assigned a pet, it's possible that person 3 (Japanese) owns the rat (as per clue 4).

Putting this together:

|               |    1    |     2     |    3     |
| Job           |         | Lawyer   | Engineer|
| Nationality   | Mexican | Colombian| Japanese |
| Pet           | Hamster | Snake    | Rat      |

Wait, what about the hamster? We didn't deduce that earlier! Since there's no other information about the hamster, it must be the pet of person 1 (Mexican).

Now we have a complete solution:

Lv11-3x3-2	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 1, we know the egyptian is between the teacher and metal fan.

From clue 2, we have two possibilities: either the security-guard is a techno fan or the colombian is a techno fan (or both).

From clue 3, we know the egyptian is to the left of the techno fan.

From clues 4 and 5, we can deduce that the accountant and security-guard are next to each other, and also next to the indian.

Let's try to combine these clues:

Since the egyptian is between the teacher and metal fan (clue 1), and to the left of the techno fan (clue 3), we can start building a possible order:

Egyptian | ? | ?

The accountant and security-guard are next to each other (clues 4 and 5). Since the egyptian is already placed, let's put them on either side of the indian (to satisfy clue 4):

? | Indian | Egyptian | ?

Now we can try to fit in the teacher and metal fan. The teacher must be between the egyptian and metal fan (clue 1), so:

Accountant/Security-Guard | Indian | Egyptian | Teacher/Metal Fan

But which one is the accountant, and which one is the security-guard? We don't have enough information yet.

Let's look at clue 2: either the security-guard is a techno fan or the colombian is. If we assume the colombian is a techno fan (for now), we can try to fit them in:

Accountant/Security-Guard | Indian | Egyptian | Colombian (Techno) | ?

This order doesn't work, since the egyptian would not be between the teacher and metal fan.

So let's try again. This time, assume the security-guard is a techno fan:

Accountant | Security-Guard (Techno) | Indian | Egyptian | ?

Now we can fit in the teacher and metal fan:

Accountant | Security-Guard (Techno) | Indian | Egyptian | Teacher (Metal)

This order satisfies all clues!

The final solution table is:

Lv11-3x3-3	"Let's analyze the clues:


From clue 3, we know the nurse is in the middle, so the nurse must be in position 2.


From clue 4, we know that either the person watching action movies drives the train or the scientist drives the train (or both). Since the scientist can't be in the same parity position as the person watching documentary movies (clue 1), and there is only one odd-numbered position left (position 1), the scientist must drive the train.


From clue 2, we know that the person driving the skateboard is to the right of the scientist. Since the scientist drives the train and is in position 1 or 3, the skateboarder must be in position 3 (because position 2 is taken by the nurse).


From clue 5, we know that the person watching spy movies is to the left of the skateboarder. Since the skateboarder is in position 3, the spy movie watcher must be in position 1 or 2.


Now, let's look at the remaining options:


* The person watching documentary movies and the scientist have the same parity positions (clue 1). This means that the documentary movie watcher cannot be in position 1 or 3, so they must be in position 2. But wait, the nurse is already in position 2! Therefore, the nurse must watch documentary movies.


* The person driving the skateboard and the scientist have different parity positions (clue 6). This confirms that the scientist drives the train and is in an odd-numbered position.

Lv11-3x3-5	"After analyzing the given clues, I've arrived at a possible solution:


|             |    1     |    2     |      3      |
| Food        | Avocado  | Grapes   | Pomegranate|
| Sport       | Lacrosse | Climbing | Badminton  |
| Transport   | Bike     | Taxi     | Ship       |

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:


From clue 5, we know that the person who's sport is climbing eats grapes. This allows us to place ""Grapes"" in column 2.


Clue 8 states that the person eating pomegranate is to the right of the person eating grapes. Therefore, ""Pomegranate"" must be in column 3.


Now, using clue 6, we know that either the person driving the ship eats pomegranate or the person who's sport is badminton eats pomegranate (or both). Since the ship driver is to the right of the bike driver (clue 1), it's likely that the ship driver is in column 3. This would mean the person eating pomegranate is also driving the ship.


Clue 2 states that the person driving the ship and the person who's sport is badminton have the same parity positions. Since the ship driver is in an odd-numbered column (3), the badminton player must be in an odd-numbered column as well, which means they're also in column 3 or column 1.


However, if we place badminton in column 1, it would contradict clue 6, which suggests that pomegranate is associated with either the ship driver or the badminton player. Therefore, badminton must be in column 3. But wait! We already have pomegranate and the ship driver in column 3.


This apparent contradiction can be resolved by revisiting clue 6: ""the person driving the ship is the person eating pomegranate or the person eating pomegranate is the person who's sport is badminton or both."" This means that all three conditions are true! The person driving the ship (column 3) eats pomegranate and also has badminton as their sport.


Now, let's focus on the remaining columns. From clue 4, we know that climbing is to the left or right of the taxi driver. Since grapes (climbing) are in column 2, the taxi must be in either column 1 or column 3. However, column 3 already has the ship and pomegranate/badminton combination. Therefore, the taxi driver must be in column 1.


Finally, from clue 7, we know that climbing is to the left or right of the ship driver. Since grapes (climbing) are already in column 2, this means lacrosse must be in column 1 (because it can't be on the left side of the ship driver).


Putting all these pieces together gives us the final solution:

Lv11-3x3-6	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 5, we know that the person eating strawberry drinks soy-milk.

From clue 1, we can conclude that the photographer does not eat strawberry (since it says ""or"" and we already know the person eating strawberry drinks soy-milk).

From clue 2, we know that the person drinking juice is on the left of the person eating strawberry. Since the person eating strawberry drinks soy-milk, this means that the person drinking juice must be in position 1.

From clue 3, we know that the coach is on the right of the person drinking juice. Therefore, the coach must be in position 2.

From clue 7 and 8, we know that the journalist and coach are next to each other. Since the coach is already in position 2, this means that the journalist must be in either position 1 or 3. But since the person drinking juice is already in position 1, the journalist must be in position 3.

From clue 6, we know that the person eating peach is in an odd position. This means that they must be in position 1 or 3. But since the person drinking juice is already in position 1 and the journalist is in position 3, this means that the person eating peach must actually be in position 2 (contradicting our earlier assumption). However, we can now conclude that the person eating apple must be in position 1 (drinking juice), the person eating peach must be in position 2, and the person eating strawberry must be in position 3.

From clue 4, we know that the person drinking sprite is not to the right of the journalist. This means that they must drink sprite in either position 1 or 2. But since the person drinking juice is already in position 1, this means that the person drinking sprite must be in position 2 (eating peach) or position 3. However, we can now conclude that the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 3 (eating strawberry), and therefore the person drinking sprite must actually be in position 2 (eating peach).

The final solution is:

Lv11-3x3-7	"Let's break down the clues step by step:


From clue 3, we know the Mexican likes card-games.


From clue 5, we know that either the person drinking cola likes writing or the Indian likes writing (or both).


From clue 7, we know the Mexican is between the person who likes puzzles and the Indian. Since the Mexican likes card-games, this means:


puzzles - Mexican - Indian


Now, let's look at the beverages:


From clue 2, we know cola is to the left of 7up.


From clue 4, we know milk is to the right of 7up.


So, the order of beverages is: cola - 7up - milk


We can now combine this with the hobby and nationality clues:


Since the person drinking cola likes writing or the Indian likes writing (clue 5), and the Indian is on one side of the Mexican who likes card-games (clue 7), it's likely that the person drinking cola likes puzzles, not writing.


Also, since the person drinking 7up is to the right of the person who likes writing (clue 6), it means the person who likes writing must be either the person drinking cola or on the far left. But we already established that cola likes puzzles, so the writer must be on the far left.


We now have:


|               |    1    |     2      |     3     |
| Beverage      | cola   |            |           |

| Nationality   | indian |            |           |


The person drinking milk is on the far right, and since the Mexican is between puzzles and Indian (clue 7), it means:


|               |    1    |     2      |     3     |
| Beverage      | cola   | 7up       | milk     |

Lv11-3x3-8	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


|               |    1     |     2     |     3     |
| Food          | Spinach  | Peas      | Broccoli  |
| Movie-Genre   | Sports   | Satire    | Animation |
| Nationality   | Canadian | Indian    | Colombian |

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 4, we know that the Canadian is either watching sports movies or eating spinach (or both). Since the person watching sports movies is in an odd position (clue 3), and the Canadian is on the left or right of the person eating broccoli (clue 1), it's likely that the Canadian is watching sports movies. Let's place them in position 1.

From clue 7, we know that the person eating spinach is on the left of the Indian. Since the Canadian is already in position 1, let's assume they're also eating spinach. This satisfies clue 4.

Now, from clue 6, we know that the person eating peas is on the right of the Indian. Let's place them in position 2.

From clue 5 (which is a bit nonsensical, but I'll ignore it since it doesn't provide any useful information), and clue 1, we can deduce that the Colombian must be eating broccoli and watching animation movies.

Finally, from clue 2, we know that the person watching animation movies is on the right of the person watching sports movies. This confirms our placement of the Canadian (sports) in position 1, followed by the Indian (satire), and then the Colombian (animation).

Here's the final solution table:

Lv11-3x3-9	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|             |   1   |    2     |     3      |
| Beverage    | soy-milk|  milk    | iced-tea  |
| Pet         | rat     | horse    | chinchilla|
| Transport   | taxi    | bike     | van       |

 

Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 2, we know the person driving the bike is between the person driving the taxi and the person drinking milk. This means the taxi must be in position 1 or 3. But from clue 4, we know the taxi is to the right of the person drinking soy-milk. Therefore, the taxi must be in position 2 is not possible, so it must be in position 1.

Now, from clue 5, we know the owner of the horse and the person driving the van have the same parity positions. Since there are only three positions, this means they must either both be in odd-numbered positions or both be in even-numbered positions. But since the taxi is already in position 1, the person driving the van cannot also be in an odd-numbered position (since that would leave no room for the bike). Therefore, the owner of the horse and the person driving the van must both be in even-numbered positions.

This means the owner of the horse must be in position 2. From clue 6, we know the person drinking milk is either the owner of the horse or the person driving the van (or both). Since the owner of the horse is already in position 2, and the taxi is in position 1, it must be that the person drinking milk is also the owner of the horse.

Now we can fill in the rest of the table. The bike must be in position 2, and the chinchilla's owner is to its right (from clue 3). Therefore, the chinchilla's owner is in position 3. The rat's owner is in position 1, since it's the only one left.

Finally, we can assign beverages: soy-milk goes with the taxi (from clue 4), milk goes with the horse's owner (from clue 6), and iced-tea goes with the chinchilla's owner."
Lv11-3x3-10	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a solution for the puzzle:

| Beverage   | soy-milk | milk       | lemonade |
| Hobby      | writing  | card-games | camping  |
| Sport      | badminton| soccer     | biathlon |

#############


Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning:

From clue 6, we know that soy-milk is to the left of lemonade, so lemonade must be in column 3.

From clue 5, writing is on the left of badminton, and since there are only three columns, writing must be in column 1, and badminton in column 2 or 3. But from clue 6, soy-milk (column 1) can't be the one with badminton, so badminton must be in column 2.

From clue 4, camping is either with soccer or milk, but not both. If camping were with milk, then from clue 2, card-games would have to be on the left of milk, which is impossible since writing is already in column 1. Therefore, camping must be with soccer, and since soccer is not in column 3 (which has biathlon or lemonade), camping and soccer must be in columns 2 and 3.

From clue 3, lemonade is either with biathlon or card-games (or both). Since camping is already in column 3 with soccer, lemonade must have biathlon. Card-games can't be in column 1 (writing), so it must be in column 2.

Finally, from clue 2, milk is on the right of card-games, which puts milk in column 2, and since camping is already there, milk must be with card-games.

From all these deductions, we get the final solution table above."
