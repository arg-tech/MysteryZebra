 Food: broccoli, lemon, apricot, pumpkin, avocado, garlic, nectarine
 Music-Genre: gospel, jazz, d&b, electronic, rock, ambient, country
 Nationality: malaysian, italian, russian, canadian, argentine, mexican, brazilian
 Sport: sailing, handball, badminton, volleyball, soccer, swimming, cricket
 Transport: subway, skateboard, van, car, motorbike, helicopter, snowmobile


Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:


1. From clue 43, we know that the person driving the subway is on the far left.
2. From clue 44, we know that the person who's sport is sailing is on the far left or far right. Since the person driving the subway is already on the far left, the person who's sport is sailing must be on the far left as well.
3. From clue 5, we know that the malaysian is the person eating lemon, and from clue 54, we know that the person driving the van is on the right of the malaysian. So, the malaysian (lemon) must be in position 1 or 2.
4. From clue 24, we know that the person eating lemon is the person driving the subway or the person who's sport is cricket is the person eating lemon, but not both. Since the person eating lemon is already determined to be in position 1 or 2, and the person driving the subway is on the far left, it must be that the person who's sport is cricket is the person eating lemon.
5. From clue 11, we know that the fan gospel and the canadian have the same parity positions. Since the malaysian (lemon) is already in an odd position (1 or 2), the fan gospel must also be in an even position (2 or 4). But from clue 37, we know that the fan gospel is in an even position, so it must be in position 2.
6. From clue 35, we know that the argentine is somewhere to the left of the person eating nectarine, and from clue 53, we know that the person eating avocado is on the left or right of the argentine. Since the person eating lemon (malaysian) is already in position 1 or 2, and the fan gospel is in position 2, the argentine must be in position 3.
7. From clue 51, we know that the person eating avocado is on the left of the person eating nectarine. Since the argentine is already in position 3, the person eating avocado must be in position 4 or 5.
8. From clue 40, we know that the fan country is somewhere to the right of the person eating garlic. Since the person eating avocado (position 4 or 5) and the person eating nectarine are already determined, the person eating garlic must be in position 6.
9. From clue 46, we know that the person driving the skateboard is the italian or the person driving the skateboard is the person eating garlic or both. Since the person eating garlic is already in position 6, the person driving the skateboard must also be in position 6.
10. From clue 52, we know that the fan d&b is the person who's sport is badminton or the person who's sport is badminton is the argentine, but not both. Since the argentine is already in position 3, and the fan gospel is in position 2, the fan d&b must be in position 5.
11. From clue 39, we know that the person who's sport is volleyball is on the left or right of the person who's sport is badminton. Since the fan d&b (badminton) is already in position 5, the person who's sport is volleyball must be in position 4.
12. From clue 42, we know that the person who's sport is handball is somewhere to the right of the fan rock. Since the person eating avocado (position 4 or 5) and the person eating nectarine are already determined, the fan rock must be in position 6 or 7.
13. From clue 48, we know that the person who's sport is soccer is the person driving the helicopter or the person who's sport is soccer is the person eating apricot or both. Since the person eating garlic (skateboard) is already in position 6, and the fan rock must be in position 6 or 7, it must be that the person who's sport is soccer is the person driving the helicopter.
14. From clue 49, we know that the fan jazz is not to the right of the russian. Since the malaysian (lemon) is already on the far left, and the fan gospel is in position 2, the fan jazz must be in position 1 or 3. But from clue 6, we know that the person eating lemon (malaysian) is already in position 1 or 2, so it must be that the fan jazz is in position 1.
15. From clue 45, we know that the person eating pumpkin is in an odd position, and since the person eating broccoli is already determined to be on the far left, it must be that the person eating pumpkin is in position 3 or 5. But from clue 10, we know that the argentine (avocado) is already in position 3, so it must be that the person eating pumpkin is in position 5.
16. From clue 41, we know that the person who's sport is handball is somewhere to the right of the fan rock. Since the fan rock must be in position 6 or 7, and the person eating garlic (skateboard) is already in position 6, it must be that the fan rock is in position 7.
17. From clue 38, we know that the person eating apricot is not to the left of the person eating garlic. Since the person eating lemon (malaysian) and the person eating broccoli are already determined, and the fan gospel is in position 2, it must be that the person eating apricot is in position 4.
18. From clue 50, we know that the argentine is somewhere to the left of the brazilian. Since the argentine (avocado) is already in position 3 or 5, and the fan country is on the far right, it must be that the brazilian is in position 6 or 7. But from clue 12, we know that the person eating garlic (skateboard) is already in position 6, so it must be that the brazilian is in position 7.
19. From clue 47, we know that the brazilian is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is soccer. Since the person driving the helicopter (soccer) is already determined to be on the far right, and the fan rock is in position 7, it must be that the person driving the snowmobile is the brazilian.
20. From clue 36, we know that the fan electronic is not to the left of the person eating pumpkin. Since the fan country is on the far right, and the person eating broccoli is already determined to be on the far left, it must be that the fan electronic is in position 4 or 6.
21. From clue 31, we know that the person driving the motorcycle (not mentioned) is not to the left of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since the person driving the skateboard (handball) and the person eating garlic are already determined, and the fan d&b (badminton) is in position 5, it must be that the person driving the motorcycle is in position 4.
