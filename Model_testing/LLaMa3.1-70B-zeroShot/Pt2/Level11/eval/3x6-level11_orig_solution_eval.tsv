| Sport         | Badminton  | Weightlifting| Cycling | Volleyball| Parkour | Biathlon  |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

* From clues 6 and 17, we know the Italian is in an odd position and owns a cat. This places the Italian in either position 1, 3, or 5.
* Clue 7 tells us that the person who's sport is cycling is between the Mexican and Brazilian. Since the Mexican can't be to the right of the Indian (clue 8), this means the Mexican must be in position 2.
* From clue 12, we know the owner of the snake is between the Chinese and the Mexican. This places the owner of the snake in position 2 or 3. But since the Mexican can't own a snake (clue 13), the snake's owner must be in position 3. The Chinese then takes position 1.
* Clue 15 tells us that the owner of the snake is to the left of the Italian, so the Italian must be in position 5.
* From clue 2, we know the Polish person is on the right of the dog's owner, who is also not the Indian (since the Indian is to the right of the Mexican). This places the Polish person in either position 4 or 6. However, since the Italian owns a cat and is in an odd position, the Polish person must be in position 6.
* Clue 11 tells us that the Chinese is not to the right of the parkour enthusiast, who is also to the right of the cat owner (clue 22). This means the parkour enthusiast must be in either position 4 or 6. But since the Polish person is already in position 6, the parkour enthusiast takes position 4.
* From clue 14, we know the horse's owner is not to the left of the Polish person, so they take position 3 (already occupied by the snake) or position 5 (occupied by the Italian). The only remaining option for the horse's owner is to be in a position that allows them to own another pet. This happens when they are also the badminton enthusiast or own another pet and have someone else as the badminton enthusiast (clue 21).
* Clues 3, 7, 16, and 20 help us determine the sports' order: Badminton-Chinese-1, Weightlifting-Mexican-2, Cycling-Brazilian-6. Volleyball goes to position 5 because of clue 9.
* Finally, we can fill in the remaining spots with biathlon (position 4 or 6) and rabbit (only available pet left).

This arrangement satisfies all conditions specified by the puzzle's clues."	{'nationality': ['chinese', 'mexican', 'indian', 'italian', 'polish', 'brazilian'], 'pet': ['dog', 'snake', 'cat', 'horse', 'frog', 'rabbit'], 'sport': ['badminton', 'weightlifting', 'cycling', 'volleyball', 'parkour', 'biathlon']}	True	6	False
Lv11-3x6-3	"After analyzing the given logic puzzle, I've come up with a solution that satisfies all 25 conditions:

| 2 | Reading | Doctor | Indian | 
| 3 | Filmmaking | Social-worker | Australian | 
| 4 | Writing | Dressmaker | Argentine | 
| 5 | Skydiving | Scientist | Mexican | 
| 6 | Magic-tricks | Musician | American |

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:


The Dutch person is on the far left (Condition 19), and they have video-games as their hobby.


The Doctor has reading as their hobby (Conditions 4, 7) and is in an even position. Since the Indian is not to the left of the person who's hobby is reading (Condition 1), the Indian must be the Doctor.


The Australian is in an odd position (Condition 12), and since they are not to the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking (Condition 23), they must have filmmaking as their hobby. The Social-worker is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking (Condition 17).


The Dressmaker has writing as their hobby, but they cannot be in an odd position because Condition 16 states that the person who's hobby is writing and the dressmaker have different parity positions.


The Mexican is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is writing (Condition 25), and since the person who's hobby is skydiving is somewhere to the left of the scientist (Condition 20), the Mexican must be on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving.


Finally, the American has magic-tricks as their hobby (Conditions 10, 24), and they cannot be in an even position because Condition 10 states that the argentine and the american have different parity positions. Therefore, the American must be on the rightmost side.

| Sport      | Climbing    | Sailing  | Parkour | Skiing   | Lemonade| Tea           |

Explanation:
Using the given clues, we can deduce the solution as follows:

From clue 2, hot-chocolate is not to the right of climbing.
From clue 7, hot-chocolate is on the left or right of parkour. Combining these two, we get that hot-chocolate is in position 3 and parkour is in either position 2 or 4.

From clue 6, tea is to the right of guinea-pig. Since tea can't be in position 1 (guinea-pig would have no one to its left), we know tea is not in position 1.

From clue 10, lacrosse is the owner of hamster or mirinda. But from clue 14, hamster is in an even position, and from clue 5, 7up and lacrosse have different parity positions. So, lacrosse must be to the right of hamster.

From clue 12, pony is in an even position. From clue 11, pony is hot-chocolate or sailing. Combining these two, we get that pony is mirinda (clue 10) and sailing is its sport.

Using clue 1, lacrosse is to the left of mouse, which puts lacrosse in position 5.
From clue 4, turtle is between hamster and tea. Since hamster is in an even position, turtle must be in position 6, and tea in position 2 or some other higher position.

Using clue 3, hedgehog is to the left of turtle, which puts hedgehog in position 1 or 3.
From clue 17, hedgehog is on the right of 7up. Since 7up can't be in position 6 (no one to its right), we get that hedgehog is in position 3.

Using clue 21, hedgehog is on the left or right of guinea-pig. So, guinea-pig is in position 1.
From clue 16, mirinda is not to the right of parkour. Since mirinda can't be in position 2 (no one to its left), we get that mirinda is in position 4.

Using clue 9, rowing is to the right of guinea-pig. So, rowing is in position 6.
From clue 24, tea and skiing have the same parity positions. Since tea can't be in an even position (guinea-pig would have no one to its left), we get that tea is in an odd position.

Combining all these deductions, we arrive at the solution.

#############

Note: The solution is unique and satisfies all the given conditions.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From condition 10, we know that the nurse and the person who's sport is cycling have the same parity positions. This means they are either both on odd-numbered positions or both on even-numbered positions.
* From condition 15, we know that the fan country and the dancer have different parity positions. Since the dancer is the fan techno (condition 17), this means the fan country cannot be in an odd-numbered position.
* Using conditions 3 and 7, we can deduce that the person who's sport is cycling is on the right side of the table (at least at position 4 or higher). Combining this with condition 10, we conclude that the nurse is also on the right side (position 4).
* From condition 2, we know that the project-manager is either the fan gospel or the person who's sport is parkour. Since the fan gospel cannot be in an odd-numbered position (condition 9), the project-manager must be at an even-numbered position.
* Using conditions 1 and 5, we can deduce that the person who's sport is parkour is on the left side of the table (at least at position 2 or lower).
* From condition 16, we know that the fan ambient is between the fan gospel and the person who's sport is cycling. This means the fan gospel must be to the left of the fan ambient.
* Using conditions 11 and 13, we can deduce that the fan rock is between the person who's sport is cycling and the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
* From condition 14, we know that the software-developer and the fan indie have the same parity positions. Since the software-developer cannot be in an odd-numbered position (condition 6), the fan indie must also be at an even-numbered position.

#############


Here's a breakdown of how I arrived at the solution:


From clue 9, photography is on the far left.


Clue 5 and clue 12 imply that fanta is in an odd position (clue 20 confirms this), and it's to the left of board-games. Since baking is on the far right (clue 23), fanta can't be in position 5, so it must be in position 4.


From clue 3, iced-tea is to the right of grapes.


Clue 6 implies that orange is not to the right of board-games. Since photography is on the far left, orange must be in position 1.


From clue 8, artichoke and cola have different parity positions.


From clue 10, mirinda and potato have different parity positions.


Clue 16 states that sudoku eats potato.


Clue 18 implies that sudoku is next to mirinda. Since fanta is already in an odd position (4), sudoku must be in either position 3 or 5.


From clue 2, artichoke doesn't eat sudoku.


Clue 7 says broccoli is to the left of sudoku.


From clue 14, traveling is to the right of iced-tea.


Clue 15 implies that traveling is next to baking. Since baking is on the far right (clue 23), traveling must be in position 5.


Now we have:


1. orange
2. ?
3. broccoli or mirinda
4. fanta
5. traveling, sudoku (in either order)
6. hot-chocolate


From clue 24, hot-chocolate eats grapes or is baking's hobby.


Since fanta is already in an odd position (4), and cola can't be next to mirinda (clue 18), cola must be in position 2.


Clues 11 and 22 imply that collecting is not iced-tea, but it can't be mirinda either (due to clue 18). Therefore, collecting must be in position 2, and cola eats pomegranate.


We also know from clues 4 and 24 that baking drinks hot-chocolate, so broccoli must eat artichoke.


The only remaining hobby is board-games, which must be in position 3.


Finally, we have the complete solution:

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

From clue 25, we know that the person with the hobby ""drawing"" is on the far left (position 1). From clue 3, we can deduce that the person with the hobby ""baking"" must be to the left of the person with the hobby ""chess"". This places the person with the hobby ""baking"" in position 2.

Clue 12 tells us that the person whose sport is ice-hockey is in an odd position, and from clue 5, we know they are to the left of the person drinking soy-milk. This means the person with the sport ice-hockey must be in position 4.

From clue 14, we can determine that the person with the hobby ""camping"" is between the person drinking tea and the person whose sport is tennis. Clue 10 tells us that the person with the hobby ""camping"" is not the same as the person whose sport is tennis, so this places the person with the hobby ""camping"" in position 6.

The rest of the positions can be filled in using a combination of the remaining clues and logical deductions.
