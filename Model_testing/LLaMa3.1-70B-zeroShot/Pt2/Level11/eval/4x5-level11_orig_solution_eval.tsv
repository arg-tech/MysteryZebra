Lv11-4x5-3	"After analyzing the puzzle, I arrived at the following solution:


|               |      1       |    2     |     3      |    4    |    5     |

| Pet           | Ferret       | Rat      | Horse      | Cat     | Bird     |

#############


Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning process:

* Clue 9 suggests that Video-games is on the far left or far right. Since there's no other hobby that can be on the far left, it must be Video-games.
* From clue 8, Chess is to the right of Video-games.
* Clue 6 places Indonesian to the left of Puzzles, and clue 1 suggests that Indonesian is either Chess or Rat owner. However, since Chess is already placed, Indonesian must own the Rat (clue 17 also supports this).
* Clue 3 indicates that American is on the left or right of the Horse owner, which is German (from clue 11). Since American can't be on the far left (Video-games), it must be between German and the Rat owner (Indonesian).
* From clue 22, American is indeed between German and Indonesian.
* Clue 19 suggests that either Hiking or Horse is owned by Martial-Arts. However, since Hiking has a fixed position relative to Nigerian (clue 4), it can't be the owner of the Horse. Therefore, Martial-Arts owns the Horse.
* From clue 10, Hiking can't be to the left of Satire (British). Since Hiking is already placed, British must be on its right.
* Clue 18 suggests that Cat isn't to the left of Rat. Given the current positions, this means Cat must be owned by the person in position 4 (Indonesian or Puzzles owner).
* From clue 14, Epic is either Bird's owner or Puzzles' hobby. However, since Puzzles is already placed, Epic must be the movie genre of Bird's owner.
* Clue 12 suggests that Bird is to the right of Ferret. Given the current positions, this means Ferret is owned by American (position 1), and Bird is owned by British (position 5).
* Finally, clue 20 places Indonesian in an odd position, which confirms its placement.

Lv11-4x5-7	"After analyzing the given clues, I was able to fill in the table as follows:


|               |     1      |    2     |       3       |     4     |      5       |

| Nationality   | pakistani  | american | british        | colombian | australian    |
| Pet           | guinea-pig | ferret   | goldfish       | fish      | goat         |
| Sport         | surfing    | golf     | snowboarding   | rowing    | weightlifting |

 
Here's the step-by-step explanation:

From clue 11, we know that either position 1 or 5 is a guinea-pig. If it was at position 5, then from clues 18 and 20, the pakistani would have to be to the left of the british, but the colombian (from clue 2) would also need to be to the left of the pakistani. This leads to a contradiction with clue 8 which states that the goat is owned by the australian, so position 1 must be guinea-pig.

From clues 9 and 14 we know that either the ferret or the person who's sport is surfing are on the far left. Since surfing cannot have guinea pig pet, then it has to be the ferret. Then from clue 13, classical music cannot go with position 1 since its already occupied by guineapig

From clues 4 and 18 we can fill in positions 3.

Now that we know the pakistani is not on the right of the goat owner (clue 15) and the colombian must be to the left of fish (from clue 21), and from above, position 1 cannot hold the fish. This leads us to put american at position 2 since australian has already been placed.

Now that we know pakistani is not on the right of goat owner and australian has already been placed at 5, the colombian must be in position 4 (clue 21). From clue 16 then salsa must go with either position 3 or 1, but since we established from above (via clues 7 and 14) funk goes to position 2. So salsa must go with position 3.

We now need to get either golf or rowing to be the american's sport. From clue 5 then rowing cannot be american, so it has to be golf for the american. 

We can also use clues 10 and 22 to verify our solution as correct


The final answer is:

Lv11-4x5-9	"I'll help you solve the puzzle.


After analyzing all 27 clues, I came up with a solution that satisfies all conditions. Here it is:


#############
|               |    1     |        2        |     3      |    4    |    5    |

| Transport     | Van      | Ship           | Motorbike | Boat    | Jet-ski   |
#############


Let me explain how I arrived at this solution:


From clues 3, 10, and 23, we know the person driving the van is a fan of rock music and is on the far left (position 1). Clue 4 tells us that the person watching disaster movies is also on the far left. Therefore, the nurse is in position 1, watching disaster movies, and is a fan of rock music.


Clues 16 and 27 tell us that the person driving the ship is a fan of ambient music and is next to the nurse (position 2). The project-manager must be in this position, as they are not watching disaster movies (clue 3).


From clue 18, we know the teacher is either driving the ship or watching disaster movies. Since the nurse is already watching disaster movies, the teacher must drive the ship or watch family movies. Clue 25 tells us that the teacher cannot be to the left of the person watching disaster movies, so they must watch family movies (position 3).


Clues 2 and 22 tell us that the teacher is to the left of the person driving the motorbike, which means the manager is in position 4.


From clue 1, we know the manager is between the fan of disco music and the person driving a boat. Clue 6 tells us that the manager has a different parity position than the fan of disco music, so they must be in an even position (4).


Clues 11 and 15 tell us that the fan of rock music (already identified as the nurse) is to the left of the person watching crime movies. Clue 5 tells us that the journalist is to the right of the person watching crime movies.


From clue 24, we know the journalist is either driving a boat or watching romance movies. Since they cannot be in position 1 (already occupied by the nurse), they must drive a boat (position 5) and watch spy movies.


Finally, clue 21 tells us that the fan of salsa music is either driving a motorbike or watching romance movies. The person watching romance movies must be in position 4 (the manager), so the fan of salsa music must drive a motorbike.
