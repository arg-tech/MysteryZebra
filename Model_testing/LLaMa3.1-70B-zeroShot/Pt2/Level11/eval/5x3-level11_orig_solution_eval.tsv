Lv11-5x3-2	"Here is the step-by-step solution to the logic puzzle:


From clue 4, we know the designer is in an even position, so it must be in either column 2 or none (since there are only three columns).


From clue 12, we know the doctor is on the far left, so the doctor must be in column 1.


From clue 5, we know the person who's sport is baseball is on the left or right of the fan funk. Since the fan funk is in an even position (clue 9), it must be in column 2. Therefore, the person who's sport is baseball must be either in column 1 or column 3.


From clue 8, we know the person who's sport is badminton and the person driving the subway have the same parity positions. Since there are only three columns, this means they must be in adjacent columns with the same parity (i.e., both even or both odd).


From clue 1, we know the person who's sport is badminton is the fan ambient or the person who's sport is badminton is the doctor, but not both. Since the doctor is already in column 1, and the person who's sport is baseball can't be in column 2 (because of clue 5), we conclude that the person who's sport is badminton must be in column 3.


From clue 7, we know the person driving the motorbike is not to the left of the person who's sport is badminton. This means the person driving the motorbike can't be in column 2 (since it would be to the left of column 3), so it must be either in column 1 or none.


From clue 11, we know the person driving the bike is the designer or the designer is the person drinking coffee, but not both. We also know that the designer is in an even position (clue 4), which means it can't be driving the motorbike (since it's already ruled out from column 2). Therefore, the designer must be either driving the bike or drinking coffee.


From clue 6, we know the designer is the person drinking 7up or the person drinking 7up is the fan dubstep, but not both. We also know that the person drinking 7up is either driving the subway or the designer (clue 3). Combining these clues with our previous conclusions, we can determine that the designer must be drinking coffee and driving the bike.


From clue 10, we know the person who's sport is golf and the person drinking coffee have the same parity positions. Since the person drinking coffee is in an even position (column 2), the person who's sport is golf must also be in an even position.


Now that we've filled in many of the blanks, let's summarize what we know:


Column 1:

* Job: Doctor
* Sport: Baseball


Column 2:

* Job: Designer
* Beverage: Coffee
* Transport: Bike


Column 3:

* Job: ??
* Beverage: Fanta (because of clue 2)
* Music-Genre: Ambient (because of clue 1 and the fact that badminton is in column 3)
* Sport: Badminton
* Transport: Subway

Since the person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking coffee, we can conclude that the person drinking 7up must be driving the subway. The only remaining job is accountant, so it must go with the person drinking 7up.


From clue 5, we know the fan funk is in an even position, which means it must be either in column 2 or none. However, since column 2 already has a music-genre (none), we conclude that the fan funk must actually be in column 1 (which had no music-genre assigned yet).

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* From clues 1 and 10, we know that the owner of the fish is on the left, and the owner of the rat is on the right.
* Clue 2 tells us that the person who likes rugby is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk.
* Clue 3 places the van driver to the left of the person eating nectarine, and clue 5 places them to the right of the rugby fan. This means the van driver must be in position 2.
* Clue 4 tells us that the sailing fan is either driving the van or drinking tea. Since the van driver is already placed, this means the sailing fan must drink tea.
* From clues 6 and 8, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is not on the left of the person eating cranberry, and they have different parity positions. This places them in position 3.
* Clue 9 tells us that the person driving the jet-ski is to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
* Finally, clue 11 places the person eating cranberry to the right of the jet-ski driver.

Lv11-5x3-6	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a possible solution:


|               |      1      |     2     |     3     |
| Food          | Broccoli    | Orange    | Spinach   |

| Nationality   | American    | Egyptian  | Spanish   |
| Transport     | Motorbike   | Taxi      | Tram      |

Here's a brief explanation of the deductions:

* From clue 2, we know the fan of dubstep is between the American and the fan of classical.
* Clue 5 states that the fan of dubstep is between the American and the Egyptian. Combining these two clues, we can deduce that the order is: American, Dubstep, Classical, Egyptian (but not necessarily in that exact order).
* From clue 7, we know the Spanish is either the fan of dubstep or has the tram as their transport method (or both). Given the previous deductions, it's likely that the Spanish is the fan of dubstep.
* Clue 9 states that the Spanish is on the left of the person eating spinach. This suggests that the order for positions 2 and 3 might be: Dubstep (Spanish), Classical/Egyptian, Spinach.
* From clue 8, we know the person who's hobby is baking is not to the right of the fan of classical. This means Baking must be in position 1 or 2. Given that Video-games is also in an odd position (clue 11), it's likely that Video-games is in position 1 and Baking is in position 3.
* Clue 10 states that the person who's hobby is Sudoku and the fan of classical have the same parity positions. This means they must be in positions with the same remainder when divided by 2 (i.e., both odd or both even). Given the previous deductions, it's likely that Sudoku is in position 2 and Classical is in position 3.
* From clue 1, we know the person driving the taxi is in an odd position. This suggests that the order for positions 1, 2, and 3 might be: Video-games (Motorbike), Sudoku (Taxi), Dubstep/Classical/Egyptian (Tram).
* Clue 4 states that the person eating orange is somewhere between the person driving the tram and the person eating broccoli. This means Orange must be in position 2, with Tram in position 3 and Broccoli in position 1.
* Finally, clue 6 states that the person driving the motorbike is not to the right of the Spanish. Given the previous deductions, this suggests that Motorbike is indeed in position 1.

Please note that there might be other possible solutions, but this one seems to satisfy all the given clues.

Lv11-5x3-7	"After solving the puzzle, I got the following solution:

From clues 4 and 3, we know that the person who likes sudoku also likes cycling, and is to the right of the person eating grapefruit.


From clue 2, we know that the person eating apricot is to the right of the person who likes sudoku.


Clue 5 tells us that the Turkish person is between the person eating grapefruit and the person who likes swimming.


Since the Brazilian person must be in an odd position (clue 6), and the chef must be in an even position (clue 7), we can deduce that the Brazilian person is in position 1 or 3, and the chef is in position 2.


From clue 8, we know that either the person eating apricot likes skateboarding, or the Brazilian person likes skateboarding. Since the Brazilian person cannot be in both positions 1 and 3, we can conclude that the person eating apricot likes skateboarding, and is therefore in position 3.

* Clue 2: The person watching time-travel movies is between the fan of reggae and the person drinking 7up. This implies that reggae is not in column 3 (since it's to the right of the person drinking 7up).
* Clue 4: The person drinking iced-tea is the fan of reggae or the fan of reggae is the person eating strawberry, but since reggae can't be in column 3, this means that iced-tea and reggae are in columns 2 and/or 1.
* Clue 5: The person eating plum is to the right of the person eating strawberry, so strawberry must be in column 1 or 2. Since grapefruit is already in column 1 (to satisfy clue 6), strawberry must be in column 2.
* Clue 7: Woodworking cannot be to the left of puzzles, which implies that woodworking is in column 3 and puzzles is in column 2.
* Clue 8: Magic-tricks is to the left of lemonade. Since grapefruit is already in column 1 (to satisfy clue 6), magic-tricks must also be in column 1.
* Clue 9: Spy movies are either watched by the fan of rock or the person eating plum, but not both. Since spy movies cannot be in columns 1 and 2, it must be in column 3.

Let me walk you through my thought process:

From clue 7, we know the British is on the far right. From clue 10, we know the teacher is not to the right of the British, so the teacher must be in position 2.

From clue 5, we know the Japanese is the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the teacher is in position 2, the Japanese must be in position 2 as well, and their hobby is drawing.

From clue 6, we know the person watching crime movies is somewhere to the left of the Japanese. This means the person watching crime movies must be in position 1.

From clue 3, we know the person watching crime movies is the person driving the car or the photographer is the person watching crime movies, but not both. Since the person watching crime movies is in position 1, and the teacher is already in position 2, the photographer must be in position 1.

Now we can start filling in the other information:

From clue 9, we know the teacher and the person driving the van have the same parity positions (i.e., both are even or both are odd). Since the teacher is in position 2 (even), the person driving the van must be in position 1 (odd).

From clue 4, we know the person driving the car and the Colombian have different parity positions. This means the person driving the car must be in an even position (i.e., position 2 or 3). Since the teacher is already in position 2, the person driving the car must be in position 3.

From clue 9, we know the person driving the bike is on the right of the person driving the car. This means the person driving the bike must be in position 3 (on the right) or position 1 does not exist to the right of position 2.

But since we already know that the photographer (who drives a van) is in position 1, and clue 12 says that the person driving the bike is not to the left of the person watching crime movies (which is also in position 1), this means the person driving the bike must be in position 3.

Now we can fill in the remaining information:
