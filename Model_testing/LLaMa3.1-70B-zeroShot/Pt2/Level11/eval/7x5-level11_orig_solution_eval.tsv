The solution was found by using the given clues and applying logical deductions. I'll explain some of the key steps:

* Clue 16 states that the person driving the motorbike is in the middle, so we can place ""motorbike"" in position 3.
* Clue 19 states that the colombian is the person driving the bike or the person watching animation movies is the colombian or both. This means that the colombian must be either in position 2 or 4. But clue 5 states that the colombian is somewhere to the right of the person watching animation movies, so the colombian must be in position 4.
* Clue 21 states that the person watching western movies is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks or the person driving the bike is the person watching western movies or both. This means that the person watching western movies must be either in position 2 or 3. But clue 36 states that the person watching western movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching mystery movies, so the person watching western movies must be in position 2.
* Clue 38 states that the owner of the snake is on the left of the person who's hobby is card-games. This means that the owner of the snake must be in position 1.
* Clue 35 states that the german is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing. This means that the german must be either in position 3 or 4. But clue 13 states that the person eating pepper is the person who's hobby is writing or the person eating pepper is the german, but not both. So the german must be in position 4.
* Clue 22 states that the person drinking almond-milk and the turkish have the same parity positions. This means that the person drinking almond-milk and the turkish must be either both odd or both even. Since the person drinking almond-milk is already in an odd position (3), the turkish must also be in an odd position, which is 5.
* Clue 2 states that the person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person drinking tea. This means that the person drinking tea must be either in position 2 or 4. But clue 39 states that the person drinking almond-milk is the person eating lime or the owner of the dog is the person drinking almond-milk or both. So the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 3, and the person drinking tea must be in position 5.
* Clue 11 states that the person watching satire movies is the turkish or the owner of the rat is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks or both. This means that the person watching satire movies must be either in position 4 or 5. But clue 41 states that the person watching western movies and the person drinking mirinda have the same parity positions, so the person watching satire movies must be in an odd position, which is 5.

* Clue 23 helped place lettuce in column 1, while clue 24 linked sports movies to snowboarding or photographer.
