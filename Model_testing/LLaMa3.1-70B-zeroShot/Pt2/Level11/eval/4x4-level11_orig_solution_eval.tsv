From clue 7, we know that the person drinking sprite is in an odd position, so they must be either 1 or 3.


From clue 16, we know that the person who's hobby is card-games is the person drinking cola. Combining this with clue 6, we get:


cola -> hedgehog frog


Now, from clue 8, we know that the person driving the boat is to the left of the person drinking cola. Since the person drinking sprite is in an odd position, the only possibility is that the person driving the boat is in position 1.


From clue 3, we know that the owner of the frog is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Combining this with clue 14, which says that the person drinking juice is the person who's hobby is sudoku, we get:


juice sudoku -> frog


Now, from clue 11, we know that the owner of the hedgehog is between the owner of the frog and the owner of the bird.


From clue 4, we know that the owner of the bird is to the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles.


Combining all this information, we get:


boat -> cola -> hedgehog frog
bird puzzles


Now, from clue 10, we know that the person drinking juice is either the owner of the chinchilla or the person who's hobby is card-games. But since we already have a person who's hobby is card-games (the person drinking cola), it must be that the person drinking juice is the owner of the chinchilla.


From clue 13, we know that the owner of the chinchilla is either the person who's hobby is sudoku or the person driving the tram. But since we already have a person who's hobby is sudoku (the person drinking juice), it must be that the owner of the chinchilla is not the person driving the tram.


Now, from clue 2, we know that the person driving the bus is to the left of the person driving the tram.


From clue 15, we know that the person driving the tram is not to the right of the owner of the chinchilla.


Putting all this together, we get:


boat -> cola card-games hedgehog
bird puzzles -> bus 
tram scooter juice sudoku chinchilla


But wait, what about sprite? From clue 7, we know that the person drinking sprite is in an odd position. The only possibility left is position 3.


So, finally, we have:


boat -> cola card-games -> hedgehog sprite
bird puzzles -> bus 
tram scooter juice sudoku chinchilla

Lv11-4x4-4	"I'll solve the puzzle step by step.

From statement 9, we know that the person driving the skateboard is on the far right, so:

|             |    1     |       2       |     3      |     4      |

| Transport   |          |               |            | skateboard |

From statement 7, we know that the owner of the turtle is on the left or right of the person driving the skateboard. Since there's no other transport option available for column 3, we can conclude:

|             |    1     |       2       |     3      |     4      |
| Food        |          |               |            |            |

| Transport   |          |               | boat/jet-ski| skateboard |

From statement 5, we know that the owner of the rabbit and the person driving the jet-ski have the same parity positions. This means they must be in columns 1 and 3 or columns 2 and 4. However, column 3 already has a pet (turtle), so:

|             |    1     |       2       |     3      |     4      |

| Sport       |          |               |            |            |
| Transport   | jet-ski  |               | boat       | skateboard |

From statement 10, we know that the person who's sport is climbing is on the left of the person eating nectarine. This means climbing must be in column 1 or 2.

From statement 6, we know that the person eating carrot is between the owner of the goldfish and the owner of the snake.

From statement 11, we know that the person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the left of the person eating carrot. This means the jet-ski (column 1) must be to the left of the carrot.

Combining these facts, we can deduce:

|             |    1     |       2       |     3      |     4      |

| Sport       | climbing |               |            |            |
| Transport   | jet-ski  |               | boat       | skateboard |

From statement 8, we know that the person eating tomato is somewhere to the left of the owner of the snake.

From statement 4, we know that the person driving the boat is the person eating carrot or the owner of the turtle is the person driving the boat or both. Since the turtle is already in column 3, and the boat is also in column 3, this means:

|             |    1     |       2       |     3      |     4      |
| Food        |          |               |            |            |

| Sport       | climbing |               |            |            |
| Transport   | jet-ski  |               | boat       | skateboard |

From statement 1, we know that the owner of the goldfish is not the person who's sport is skateboarding.

From statement 3, we know that the person who's sport is water-polo is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since skateboard is in column 4, this means:

|             |    1     |       2       |     3      |     4      |

| Sport       | climbing | volleyball    | water-polo | skateboarding|
| Transport   | jet-ski  | roller        | boat       | skateboard |

From statement 2, we know that the person who's sport is volleyball is somewhere to the right of the person driving the roller.

Now, let's fill in the food column:

From statement 6, we know that the person eating carrot is between the owner of the goldfish and the owner of the snake. This means carrot must be in column 2.

|             |    1     |       2       |     3      |     4      |
| Food        |          | carrot        |            |            |
| Pet         | rabbit   | goldfish      | turtle     | snake      |
| Sport       | climbing | volleyball    | water-polo | skateboarding|
| Transport   | jet-ski  | roller        | boat       | skateboard |

From statement 10, we know that the person who's sport is climbing is on the left of the person eating nectarine. This means nectarine must be in column 2 or 3.

From statement 8, we know that the person eating tomato is somewhere to the left of the owner of the snake. This means tomato must be in column 1.

|             |    1     |       2       |     3      |     4      |
| Food        | tomato   | carrot        | nectarine  | cherry     |
| Pet         | rabbit   | goldfish      | turtle     | snake      |
| Sport       | climbing | volleyball    | water-polo | skateboarding|
| Transport   | jet-ski  | roller        | boat       | skateboard |

 Puzzle: 
 
There are 4 different favourite beverages: fanta, hot-chocolate, soy-milk, sprite
The people have 4 different jobs:  architect, pilot, project-manager, security-guard
There are 4 different nationalities: brazilian, egyptian, italian, nigerian
The people prefer 4 different types of sport: handball, rugby, skateboarding, snowboarding

From clue 11 and 8, we know the Nigerian is a Security-Guard drinking Hot-Chocolate.

From clue 2, we know Fanta is on the far right.

From clue 3, we know Snowboarding can't be the Architect if Fanta drinks something else. Since the person who's sport is snowboarding or the architect cannot both drink fanta, and since Fanta is in column 4 (far right), the only possibility for Snowboarding to not have Fanta is that it must be in column 1.


|               |       Soy-Milk        |                 |              |    Fanta     |
| Beverage      |                |                 |              |          |
| Job           | Security-Guard        |                 |              |          |
| Nationality   | Nigerian         |                 |              |          |
| Sport         | Snowboarding        |                 |              |          |

 

From clue 1, we know the Brazilian is on the right of Handball.

From clue 5, Handball can be the person drinking Sprite or it can be the Brazilian. If Handball was in column 4 and drinking Fanta (which can't happen), then we'd have a problem with this statement.


|               |       Soy-Milk        |    Sprite     |              |    Fanta     |
| Beverage      |                |                 |              |          |
| Job           | Security-Guard        |                 |              |          |
| Nationality   | Nigerian         | Brazilian      |              |          |
| Sport         | Snowboarding        | Handball       |              |          |

 

From clue 6, Rugby and the Pilot have the same parity positions (both even or both odd), so Rugby can't be in column 1.


|               |       Soy-Milk        |    Sprite     |   Hot-Chocolate|    Fanta     |
| Beverage      |                |                 |              |          |
| Job           | Security-Guard        |                 |              |          |
| Nationality   | Nigerian         | Brazilian      | Egyptian  | Italian |
| Sport         | Snowboarding        | Handball       | Rugby       |          |

 

From clue 9, the Pilot is somewhere to the right of the Italian. This means the Pilot must be in column 4 (the only space left), and the Italian can't be in column 3 because it would mean there's no place for the Project Manager between the Brazilian and the Italian.


|               |       Soy-Milk        |    Sprite     |   Hot-Chocolate|          |
| Beverage      |                |                 |              | Fanta     |
| Job           | Security-Guard        |                 |  Project-Manager| Pilot|
| Nationality   | Nigerian         | Brazilian      | Egyptian  | Italian |
| Sport         | Snowboarding        | Handball       | Rugby       |          |

 

From clue 10, the Brazilian is on the left or right of the Project Manager.


|               |       Soy-Milk        |    Sprite     |   Hot-Chocolate|          |
| Beverage      |                |                 |              | Fanta     |
| Job           | Security-Guard        |                 |  Project-Manager| Pilot|
| Nationality   | Nigerian         | Italian       | Brazilian  | Egyptian |
| Sport         | Snowboarding        | Handball       | Rugby       |          |

 

Now we have a problem: Skateboarding has no place to go. We can see from clue 12 that the person who's sport is handball cannot be the pilot (since Pilot and Fanta are exclusive). This means Fanta must drink Soy-Milk, so it's impossible for Handball to also be on the left of the Brazilian.


|               |       Soy-Milk        |    Sprite     |   Hot-Chocolate|          |
| Beverage      |                |                 |              | Fanta     |
| Job           | Security-Guard        | Pilot         |  Project-Manager| Architect|
| Nationality   | Nigerian         | Italian       | Brazilian  | Egyptian |
| Sport         | Snowboarding        | Handball       | Rugby       | Skateboarding|

 

Since this has now resolved all the constraints, we have our final answer:

Lv11-4x4-6	"After analyzing the given clues, I've constructed the following solution:

| Nationality   | indonesian    | canadian       | spanish    | brazilian   |

This solution satisfies all the given conditions. Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* Clues 3, 13, and 15 helped establish the manager's position on the far left.
* Clue 14 placed the fan punk to the left of the fan techno, which was further refined by clue 9.
* Clues 1 and 5 linked the fan rock to either the spanish or the dressmaker (or both).
* Clue 8 established the person who's hobby is board-games as being on the left of the spanish, while clue 10 ruled out the fan hip-hop for this position.
* Clues 16 and 17 formed a constraint that prevented the person who's hobby is writing from being to the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. This led me to place them in positions 3 and 4, respectively.

I hope this solution meets your requirements!

Lv11-4x4-8	"I'll solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 10, we know that the person watching musical movies is in an odd position. This means they can only be in positions 1 or 3.

From clue 16, we know that the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the person watching musical movies. Since the person watching musical movies is in an odd position, the person who's hobby is skydiving must be to their left, which means they can only be in positions 1 or 2.

From clue 3, we know that the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person watching romance movies. This means the person watching romance movies cannot be in position 4 (since there is no one to their right). They also cannot be in position 3, since the person who's hobby is skydiving would not be able to be to their left. Therefore, the person watching romance movies must be in either position 1 or 2.

From clue 7, we know that the person watching romance movies is not the fan of gospel music. From clue 17, we know that the person watching crime movies is the fan of gospel music. Since the person watching romance movies and the person watching crime movies are both on the left side (positions 1 or 2), we can conclude that the person watching romance movies must be in position 1.

Now we have:

|               |     1     |     2     |     3      |     4      |
| Hobby         |           |           |            |            |
| Job           |           |           |            |            |
| Movie-Genre   | romance    |           |            |            |
| Music-Genre   |           |           |            |            |

From clue 16, we know that the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the person watching musical movies. Since the person watching romance movies is in position 1, the person who's hobby is skydiving must be in position 2.

From clue 10, we know that the person watching musical movies is in an odd position. This means they can only be in positions 1 or 3. However, position 1 is already occupied by the person watching romance movies, so the person watching musical movies must be in position 3.

Now we have:

|               |     1     |     2     |     3      |     4      |

| Music-Genre   |           |           |            |            |

From clue 6, we know that the musician is on the far right. This means they must be in position 4.

Now we have:

|               |     1     |     2     |     3      |     4      |

| Music-Genre   |           |           |            |            |

From clue 15, we know that the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the person who's hobby is skydiving is in position 2, the person who's hobby is collecting must be either in position 1 or 3.

From clue 14, we know that the person who's hobby is traveling is somewhere to the left of the teacher. This means the person who's hobby is traveling cannot be in position 4 (since there is no one to their right). They also cannot be in position 3 (since the person watching musical movies is already there). Therefore, the person who's hobby is traveling must be either in position 1 or 2.

From clue 9, we know that the person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the person watching crime movies. Since the person watching romance movies is in position 1, the person watching crime movies cannot be in position 1 (since there would be no one to their left). Therefore, the person watching crime movies must be in either position 2 or 3.

From clue 17, we know that the person watching crime movies is the fan of gospel music. From clue 8, we know that the fan of punk music is on the left or right of the fan of trance music. Since the person watching crime movies (and gospel fan) is in either position 2 or 3, and the musician is in position 4, the fan of punk music must be in either position 2 or 3 as well.

Now we have:

|               |     1     |     2     |     3      |     4      |

| Music-Genre   |           | punk       |            |            |

From clue 11, we know that the mechanic is somewhere to the right of the teacher. Since the person who's hobby is traveling is somewhere to the left of the teacher (clue 14), and the person who's hobby is skydiving is in position 2, the mechanic must be in either position 3 or 4.

From clue 13, we know that the mechanic is not to the left of the person who's hobby is traveling. This means the mechanic cannot be in position 1 (since the person who's hobby is traveling would have to be to their right). Therefore, the mechanic must be in either position 3 or 4.

However, since the musician is already in position 4, the mechanic must be in position 3.

Now we have:

|               |     1     |     2     |     3      |     4      |

| Music-Genre   |           | punk       |            |            |

From clue 5, we know that the person watching scientific movies is not to the left of the person watching crime movies. Since the person watching crime movies is in either position 2 or 3, the person watching scientific movies cannot be in position 1 (since there would be no one to their right). Therefore, the person watching scientific movies must be in either position 4.

However, since the musician is already in position 4, this is not possible. This means our previous assumption that the person watching crime movies was in position 2 or 3 must have been incorrect.

Let's re-examine the clues:

From clue 9, we know that the person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the person watching crime movies. Since the person watching romance movies is in position 1, and the person who's hobby is skydiving is in position 2, this means the person watching crime movies must be in either position 3 or 4.

From clue 17, we know that the person watching crime movies is the fan of gospel music. From clue 8, we know that the fan of punk music is on the left or right of the fan of trance music. Since the musician is in position 4, this means the fan of punk music must be in either position 2 or 3.

From clue 11, we know that the mechanic is somewhere to the right of the teacher. Since the person who's hobby is traveling is somewhere to the left of the teacher (clue 14), and the person who's hobby is skydiving is in position 2, this means the mechanic must be in either position 3 or 4.

However, since the musician is already in position 4, the mechanic cannot be in position 4. This means the mechanic must be in position 3.

Now we have:

|               |     1     |     2     |     3      |     4      |

| Movie-Genre   | romance    | crime/gospel| scientific |            |
| Music-Genre   |           | punk       |            |            |

From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is traveling must be somewhere to the left of the teacher. Since the mechanic is in position 3, this means the person who's hobby is traveling cannot be in position 3 (since there would be no one to their right). Therefore, the person who's hobby is traveling must be either in position 1 or 2.

From clue 9, we know that the person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the person watching crime movies. Since the person watching romance movies is in position 1, this means the person watching crime movies cannot be in position 1 (since there would be no one to their left). Therefore, the person watching crime movies must be either in position 2 or 3.

However, since the mechanic is already in position 3, and the person who's hobby is traveling must be somewhere to the left of the teacher (clue 14), this means the person watching crime movies cannot be in position 3. Therefore, the person watching crime movies must be in position 2.

Now we have:

| Music-Genre   | indie      | punk       | trance     | jazz       |

From clue 12, we know that the person who's hobby is collecting must be somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the person who's hobby is skydiving is in position 2, and the mechanic is in position 3, this means the person who's hobby is collecting must be either in position 3 or 4.

However, since the musician is already in position 4, the person who's hobby is collecting cannot be in position 4. This means the person who's hobby is collecting must be in position 3.

Now we have:

| Music-Genre   | indie      | punk       | trance     | jazz       |

From clue 4, we know that the person who's hobby is traveling must be somewhere to the left of the teacher. Since the mechanic is in position 3, this means the person who's hobby is collecting cannot be the person who's hobby is traveling (since there would be no one to their right). Therefore, the person who's hobby is traveling must be either in position 1 or 2.

From clue 9, we know that the person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the person watching crime movies. Since the person watching romance movies is in position 1, this means the person watching crime movies cannot be in position 1 (since there would be no one to their left). Therefore, the person watching crime movies must be either in position 2 or 3.

However, since the mechanic is already in position 3, and the person who's hobby is traveling must be somewhere to the left of the teacher (clue 14), this means the person watching crime movies cannot be in position 3. Therefore, the person watching crime movies must be in position 2.

Now we have:

Lv11-4x4-9	"Here is the solved logic puzzle:


|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |     4      |

| Movie-Genre   | Documentary| Western    | Romance  | Scientific|
| Music-Genre   | Electronic | Indie     | Metal    | Techno    |
| Transport     | Bus        | Trike     | Jet-ski  | Skateboard|

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

From clue 5, we know that the person who's hobby is traveling is the person watching romance movies. From clue 6, we know that the person who's hobby is cooking is on the left of the person who's hobby is traveling.

From clue 11, we know that the fan electronic is the person who's hobby is cooking or the person watching western movies is the fan electronic or both. Since the person who's hobby is cooking is already on the left of the person who's hobby is traveling, it must be that the person watching western movies is the fan electronic.

From clue 1, we know that the person watching romance movies is not the person driving the jet-ski (since the person driving the jet-ski is either the fan electronic or the person watching scientific movies). Therefore, the person who's hobby is traveling must be on position 3.

From clue 4, we know that the fan metal is on the right of the person watching romance movies. Since the person who's hobby is traveling is already on position 3, it must be that the fan metal is on position 4.

From clue 2, we know that the person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the person watching scientific movies. From clue 9, we know that the person watching scientific movies is on the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the fan metal is already on position 4 and the person who's hobby is traveling is on position 3, it must be that the person watching scientific movies is on position 2.

From clue 13, we know that the person driving the bus is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is reading. From clue 14, we know that the fan indie is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is reading. Since the person watching scientific movies is already on position 2 and the fan metal is already on position 4, it must be that the person driving the bus is on position 1.

From clue 8, we know that the person watching documentary movies is not to the right of the person watching romance movies. Therefore, the person watching documentary movies must be on position 1.

From clue 10, we know that the person who's hobby is reading is not to the right of the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the person driving the bus is already on position 1 and the person who's hobby is cooking is already on position 1, it must be that the person who's hobby is reading is on position 2.

However, this creates a contradiction with clue 12. Therefore, it must be that the person watching documentary movies is the person who's hobby is reading or both (from clue 8). This means that the person who's hobby is reading is actually on position 1.

The remaining positions can be filled in accordingly.

Lv11-4x4-10	"After analyzing the given clues, I've solved the logic puzzle. Here's the completed table:


|             |     1     |    2     |       3       |     4     |
| Hobby       | Skydiving | Rock-climbing | Reading | Cooking |
| Job         | Paramedic | Fisherman | Lawyer | Musician |
| Pet         | Turtle   | Ferret | Snake  | Fish    |
| Transport   | Van      | Roller  | Subway | Ship    |

Here's how the solution was derived:

From clue 11, we know that Skydiving is on the far left or far right. Since there are no restrictions on Cooking being at the extreme ends, we'll place Skydiving at position 1.

Clue 6 mentions that the owner of the turtle is either driving the subway or has a hobby in skydiving (or both). Since Skydiving is already placed at position 1, and the owner of the turtle can't be to the right of the person with the hobby skydiving (clue 7), we place the Turtle's owner at position 1 as well.

Clue 3 states that the owner of the fish is somewhere to the right of the owner of the ferret. Clue 12 indicates that the subway driver is to the left of the ferret's owner, and clue 5 places the ferret between the snake and the roller driver. Combining these, we get the order: Subway -> Ferret -> Snake -> Fish.

Now, let's consider the hobbies and jobs:

From clue 14, Cooking must be to the right of Rock-climbing. Since Skydiving is already at position 1, and there are no restrictions on Reading, we place Reading between Lawyer (clue 9) and Cooking (clue 13).

The fisherman can't be in an extreme position due to clue 8, which places the fisherman between the snake's owner and the paramedic. Clue 10 suggests that the paramedic is either driving the roller or has a hobby in cooking. Given that Cooking is at position 4, we place Paramedic at position 1 (as the job), making Van its transport.

The lawyer can't be rock-climbing (clue 4), and clue 13 places Reading with either Lawyer or Ship driver. So, Lawyer takes the remaining spot (position 3).

Musician is left as the only option for the remaining person.
