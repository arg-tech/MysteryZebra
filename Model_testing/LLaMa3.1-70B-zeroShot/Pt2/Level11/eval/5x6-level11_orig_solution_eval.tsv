Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:

I started by using clues 7, 9, and 31 to determine that cauliflower is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5). Clue 3 then told me that cauliflower cannot be house music, so it must be gospel or soul. But clue 23 said that gospel and cauliflower have the same parity positions, which means they are both in odd positions.

Next, I used clues 2 and 32 to determine that swimming is indie music, and dog is the pet associated with swimming. Clue 16 then told me that mouse is on the left of swimming, so mouse must be in position 5.

Clue 14 said that soul is woodworking, which is an odd position (clue 6). But clue 19 said that salsa and woodworking have different parity positions, so salsa must be in an even position. Clue 20 then told me that gospel is to the left of salsa.

I continued using clues to fill in the remaining information:

* Clue 28 said that pumpkin is either woodworking or climbing. Since woodworking is already taken by soul, pumpkin must be climbing.
* Clue 30 said that radish is on the right of house music.
* Clue 34 said that spinach is not mouse (since mouse is already taken), so it must be the other option, which is soul.
* Clue 10 said that rowing is to the left of dancing. Since rowing cannot be in position 1 (clue 25), it must be in position 2.
* Clue 13 said that parkour is either salsa or reading. Since salsa is already taken by house music, parkour must be reading.

And so on...

After using all the clues, I arrived at the final solution table above."	{'food': ['chinchilla, eggplant', 'pumpkin, radish', 'pear, cauliflower', 'spinach', 'lizard, mouse', 'rat, dog'], 'hobby': ['fishing', 'woodworking', 'video-games', 'hiking', 'dancing', 'reading'], 'music-genre': ['gospel', 'soul', 'house', 'metal', 'salsa', 'indie'], 'pet': ['chinchilla', 'pony', 'rat', 'mouse', 'dog', 'lizard'], 'sport': ['rowing', 'climbing', 'baseball', 'cricket', 'swimming', 'parkour']}	True	6	False

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 1, we know that the Malaysian is either the owner of the guinea-pig or drives the snowmobile. Clue 4 tells us that the Malaysian is between the owner of the guinea-pig and the Nigerian. This means that the guinea-pig's owner must be on one side of the Malaysian.

Clue 5 places the person drinking 7up at the far left, which from clue 11 could also mean they are a musician or driving a helicopter (or both). However, since the fisherman is also placed at the far left by clue 7, we can infer that these two individuals might be one and the same.
