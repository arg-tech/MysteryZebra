* I used the given parity information (e.g. ""the dutch and the person driving the car have the same parity positions"") to narrow down the possibilities.
* I then used the constraints on job, movie-genre, music-genre, nationality, and transport to further restrict the possibilities.
* Finally, I used a combination of logical deductions and trial-and-error to arrive at a solution that satisfied all the given constraints.
