* Next, I used clue 20 to place ""Writing"" as the hobby for the person watching crime movies, which is on the left or right of ""Drawing"".
* Clue 13 helped me place ""Almond-milk"" as the beverage for the person watching crime movies, and also placed ""Cabbage"" on either side of ""Almond-milk"".
* Using clues 2 and 14, I was able to determine that ""Italian"" is not the owner of the frog, and ""Frog"" is not to the right of ""Almond-milk"".
* Clue 9 helped me place ""Chess"" as the hobby for the person owning a horse or drinking almond-milk.
* The rest of the clues were used to fill in the remaining blanks, using process of elimination and logic.

Note that this solution satisfies all 36 clues provided."

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve it:

* Started by using clues that provided specific information about certain rows or columns, such as clue 15 (the owner of the mouse is in the middle) and clue 26 (the person drinking mirinda is in an odd position).
* Used clues that established relationships between different rows or columns, such as clue 1 (the person who's sport is ice-hockey is the person watching comedy movies or the fan blues), clue 2 (the person watching comedy movies is somewhere to the left of the fan classical), and clue 10 (the person driving the skateboard is somewhere to the right of the owner of the snake).
* Gradually filled in more information using clues that provided additional constraints, such as clue 4 (the person drinking water is not to the right of the fan punk) and clue 7 (the person watching comedy movies is not to the right of the fan punk).
* Continued to refine the solution by using clues that provided even more specific information, such as clue 20 (the owner of the snake is not to the right of the person drinking lemonade), clue 21 (the person drinking lemonade is not to the left of the owner of the snake), and clue 25 (the person watching mystery movies is somewhere to the right of the person drinking lemonade).
* Eventually, all rows and columns were filled in, resulting in a unique solution.

* Clue 10 then linked the bus driver to the ship driver.
* Clues 11, 17, and 26 constrained the videographer's position and pet ownership.
* Clue 18 restricted the position of the ambient fan relative to the quad-bike driver.
* Clues 20 and 35 helped establish the relative positions of the iced-tea drinker and bus driver.
* Clue 22 fixed the position of the quad-bike driver as left of the ship driver.
* Clues 23-25, 30, and 32 constrained the chinchilla owner's position and pet relationships.

1. Started by using the parity constraints (conditions 1, 3, 8, 9, 12, and 22) to determine the possible positions for certain individuals.
2. Used conditions 5-7 to identify the person driving the bike as the one watching martial-arts movies and having a hobby of singing.
3. Employed conditions 10-14 to establish relationships between the bike rider, the australian, and other individuals.
4. Utilized conditions 15-18 to determine the position of the person eating lime and their relation to the bike rider.
5. Applied conditions 19-23 to identify the person who's hobby is sudoku and their relationship with other individuals.
6. Used conditions 24-27 to establish relationships between the japanese, italian, and chinese nationalities.
7. Employed conditions 28-30 to determine the position of the person eating artichoke and their relation to the western movies watcher.
8. Utilized conditions 31-34 to establish additional relationships between individuals.
9. Finally, used condition 35 to place the person driving the roller in relation to the quad-bike driver.
