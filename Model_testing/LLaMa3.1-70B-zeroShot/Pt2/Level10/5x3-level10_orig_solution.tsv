| Transport     | motorbike   | tram        | airplane       |
#############

Here's how I solved it:

From clue 7, the Chinese person drives an airplane.
From clue 9, the person who likes video-games is either Chinese or a fisherman. Since the Chinese person drives an airplane (clue 7), they must like video-games.

From clue 5, the architect and the person driving the airplane have the same parity positions. Since the airplane driver is in position 3, the architect must be in position 2 (an even position).

From clue 2, the architect is to the left of the tram driver.
From clue 6, the police-officer is on the left or right of the tram driver. Since the architect is already in position 2, the police-officer must be in position 1.

From clue 8, the fisherman is to the right of the person who likes card-games. The only remaining position for the fisherman is position 3, which means the person who likes card-games is in position 1. However, this contradicts our previous conclusion that the police-officer is in position 1. Therefore, the person who likes card-games must be in a lower-numbered position than initially thought.

From clue 12, the soy-milk drinker is in an even position (2). From clue 11, the person who drinks soy-milk either likes filmmaking or drives an airplane, but not both. Since the airplane driver already has a hobby (video-games), the soy-milk drinker must like filmmaking.

From clue 10, the tea drinker is not to the left of the soy-milk drinker.
From clue 13, the tea drinker is not to the left of the motorbike rider.

The only remaining beverage for position 1 is cola. The only remaining nationality for position 1 is Spanish."

Lv10-5x3-4	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


|               |     1      |       2       |     3      |
| Beverage      | juice      |    mirinda   | hot-chocolate|
| Job           | writer     | videographer | librarian   |
| Movie-Genre   | adventure  | romance       | western      |
| Nationality   | australian | german        | dutch        |
| Transport     | bike        | snowmobile    | ship         |

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 10, we know the German is the videographer.

From clue 2, we know the German (videographer) is on the right of the person drinking juice. So, the person drinking juice must be in position 1.

From clue 8, we know the person watching adventure movies is to the left of the videographer. Since the person drinking juice is already in position 1, the person watching adventure movies must also be in position 1.

Clue 4 tells us that the person driving the snowmobile is not to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate. This means the person driving the snowmobile cannot be in position 2 (since it would be to the left of the person in position 3). Therefore, the person driving the snowmobile must be in position 2.

From clue 1, we know that either the person watching romance movies or the German (videographer) drinks mirinda. Since the German is already assigned as the videographer, it's more likely that the person drinking mirinda watches romance movies.

Now, let's look at the movie-genres. We have adventure (already assigned to position 1), romance (assigned to position 2), and western. Clue 3 tells us that the person watching western movies is on the right of the videographer. Therefore, the person watching western movies must be in position 3.

Clue 5 tells us that the person watching western movies is not to the right of the Dutch. Since the person watching western movies is in position 3, this means the Dutch cannot be in position 2 (otherwise, it would be to the left of the person watching western movies). Therefore, the Dutch must be in position 1.

However, we already know that the Australian drinks juice and watches adventure movies in position 1. So, the Dutch must be in position 3, but this is not possible since the person watching western movies is already assigned to position 3. This means our initial assumption about the Dutch being in position 1 was incorrect.

Let's go back to clue 5. Since the person watching western movies is not to the right of the Dutch, it's more likely that the Dutch watches romance movies (in position 2). Therefore, the German (videographer) must be watching another genre, which cannot be adventure (already assigned to position 1).

From clue 7, we know that either the person drinking hot-chocolate is driving the ship or the German (not possible since the German is already assigned as the videographer). So, it's more likely that the person drinking hot-chocolate drives the ship.

Putting all these clues together, we arrive at the final solution.

| Transport   | car         | boat       | helicopter   |

################


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 10, we know the person eating broccoli is on the far right.
* Clue 3 tells us that either the fisherman drives a car or the person driving a car eats papaya. Since the person eating broccoli is already determined to be on the far right, it's more likely that the fisherman drives a car (to avoid a contradiction with clue 6).
* From clue 4, we know the fisherman is to the left of the person whose hobby is magic-tricks.
* Clue 2 tells us that collecting is to the left of magic-tricks. Combining this with clue 9, we can conclude that collecting is also to the right of iced-tea.
* Since the librarian cannot be to the left of the person drinking iced-tea (clue 1), and collecting is to the right of iced-tea, it's likely that iced-tea is in position 2. This also satisfies clue 8, as chess is not to the left of the architect.
* Clue 5 tells us that helicopter is to the right of juice. Since the person drinking broccoli is already on the far right, juice must be in position 3.
* From clue 6, we know nectarine is to the right of papaya. Since collecting and nectarine have the same parity positions (clue 7), collecting must be in position 1 or 3. However, since collecting is to the right of iced-tea (clue 9), it must be in position 1.
* Finally, we can fill in the remaining blanks: the person eating nectarine is in position 2, and the architect is in position 3.

Note that this solution satisfies all the given clues."
Lv10-5x3-6	"After solving the logic puzzle, I arrived at the following solution:

| Sport         | badminton | tennis        | swimming |
| Transport     | bike      | jet-ski       | helicopter|

Let me explain the reasoning behind this solution:

From clue 1, we know that the fan of techno is on the far right. From clue 8, we also know that the fan of techno is on the left or right of the fan of funk. Therefore, the fan of funk must be in position 2.

From clue 5, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person who's sport is swimming. From clue 4, we also know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is to the right of the person driving the bike. Therefore, the person driving the bike must be in position 1.

From clue 3, we know that the person who's sport is swimming is either the fan of techno or the owner of the goldfish, but not both. Since the fan of techno is already placed on the far right, the owner of the goldfish must be associated with swimming, and they can't be in position 1 (because the person driving the bike is there). Therefore, the owner of the goldfish and the person who's sport is swimming must be in position 2 or 3. But from clue 5, we also know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person who's sport is swimming, so the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 2.

From clue 6, we know that the person who's sport is swimming is on the left or right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since the person who's sport is swimming is already placed in either position 2 or 3, and the person drinking hot-chocolate is also in one of those positions, the person who's sport is tennis must be in position 1 or 3.

From clue 7, we know that the fan of punk is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is already placed in position 2, and the fan of funk is also in position 2, the fan of punk must be in position 1.

From clue 9, we know that the owner of the frog is not to the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since the person drinking mirinda can't be in position 3 (because the fan of techno is there), and the person drinking hot-chocolate is already placed in position 2, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 1.

From clue 10, we know that the person drinking mirinda is to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate. This confirms our previous placement of the person drinking mirinda in position 1 and the person drinking hot-chocolate in position 2.

Finally, from clue 2, we know that the person driving the helicopter is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming. Since the person who's sport is swimming is already placed in either position 2 or 3, and the person driving the bike is in position 1, the person driving the helicopter must be in position 3.

The only remaining pet is the goat, which can go with the fan of punk in position 1. The only remaining sport is badminton, which can go with the person drinking mirinda in position 1.

Here is the final solution:

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 1, we know the Polish person is to the right of the motorbike. This means the motorbike must be in column 2 or 3.

From clue 4, we know the Polish person is between the musical movie fan and the scooter driver. Since the Polish person is already on the right side (due to clue 1), this suggests that the musical movie fan is likely in column 1 or 2.

Clue 5 tells us the writer is to the right of the crime movie fan, which means the crime movie fan cannot be in column 3. This also implies that the writer must be either in column 2 or 3.

From clue 7, we know the security guard is not driving the skateboard, so they can't be in column 1 (since the skateboard is there).

Using these deductions and working through the possibilities, I arrived at the above solution.

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* From clue 10, Lemonade must be on the far left or right. Since clue 9 states that the person drinking lemonade is either the owner of the rat or driving the scooter (but not both), and there's no other option for the far left/right position, I placed Lemonade in position 1.
* Clue 8 says the Canadian eats banana, so Banana goes to position 1 as well. This also satisfies clue 4, which states that the person eating banana is not to the left of the person drinking cola.
* Clue 12 states that the person eating banana and the owner of the horse have the same parity positions. Since Banana is in an odd position (1), Horse must be in an odd position as well (3).
* Clue 13 says the person driving the train and the person drinking cola have the same parity positions. Since Train is in an even position (2 or none), Cola must be in an even position as well, which means it goes to position 3.
* The remaining positions can be filled by process of elimination:
	+ Almond-milk can't go with Mexican (clue 5), so it goes with Dutch. Since the person driving the tram is in an even position (clue 6), Tram must go to position 2, which means Almond-milk and Dutch go to position 2 as well.
	+ The owner of the mouse can't be driving the tram (clue 2), so Mouse goes to position 3. This also satisfies clue 11, which states that the Dutch is on the left or right of the person eating lettuce.

The resulting table satisfies all the given clues."

From clue 8, we know the person watching family movies is in an even position (2).

Clue 7 tells us that the person eating cabbage is on the left of the dressmaker, so cabbage must be in position 1.

From clue 10, we know the dressmaker is either eating onion or owning a fish. Since the owner of the fish can't be to the left of the Malaysian (clue 1), and the Malaysian can't be to the right of the American (clue 3), the dressmaker must own the goat.

Clue 5 tells us that the owner of the goat is between the lizard and the fish. Since the goat is in position 2, the lizard must be in position 1, and the fish in position 3.

From clue 11, we know the person eating spinach is not to the left of the analyst. This means spinach must be in position 3.

Clue 4 tells us that the dressmaker is indeed the dressmaker.

The only nationality left for position 2 is Malaysian.

Finally, American can't be to the right of the dressmaker (clue 3), so it must be in position 3. The remaining nationality, German, goes to position 1.
