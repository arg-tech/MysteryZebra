#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:

1. From clue 33, we know lime is on the far left.
2. Clue 17 tells us that mango is next to lime, so it must be in position 2.
3. Avocado can't be in position 1 (clue 25), and it's not the person who's sport is handball (clue 11). From clue 27, avocado can be either the owner of the cat or the person who's sport is rowing, but since cat is not to the left of ambient (clue 31), avocado must be in position 3.
4. Carrot is between skiing and cat (clue 30) and also on the left of dubstep (clue 35). Since biathlon can't be carrot's sport (clue 16), it must be in position 4.
5. Watermelon is not to the right of frog (clue 38), so it must be in position 5.
6. Pomegranate is associated with dubstep (clue 10) and can't be on the right of lizard (clue 15). It's also not associated with ambient, funk, or soul (clues 13, 18, 22), so it must be in position 6.
7. Now we can fill in the music-genres:
	* Ambient is with basketball (clue 21) and on one side of skiing (clue 32).
	* Funk is to the left of soul (clue 22) and not associated with handball, rowing, or skateboarding.
	* Soul is next to dubstep (clue 13), which means metal must be in position 5.
	* R&b is next to ambient (clue 18) and can't be on the left of guinea-pig (clue 3).
8. Finally, we fill in the pets:
	* Bird is on one side of avocado (clues 11, 24), which means it's with lime.
	* Guinea-pig is to the right of lime (clue 5) and not associated with handball or rowing.
	* Cat is to the right of carrot (clue 4) and can't be on the left of ambient (clue 31).
	* Goldfish is to the right of avocado (clue 26), which means it's with watermelon or pomegranate. However, clue 6 says goldfish is not to the left of watermelon, so it must be with carrot.
	* Lizard is associated with metal and can't be on the left of rowing (clue 12).
	* Frog is to the left of skateboarding (clue 8) and can't be on the right of guinea-pig (clue 28), so it must be in position 6.

The final solution satisfies all conditions."

This solution satisfies all the given conditions. Note that some of the steps involved using the parity constraints to narrow down the possible positions, and then using the other clues to fill in the remaining gaps.


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 36, we know the mexican is on the far left.
* Clue 28 tells us that the owner of the hamster is on the left or right of the entrepreneur. Given the parity constraints (e.g., clues 4, 9, and 33), it's likely that the entrepreneur is in an even position, which would put the owner of the hamster in either position 1 or 3.
* Clue 21 tells us that the doctor is the owner of the dog. Since the doctor can't be the mexican (clue 8), and given the constraints on the doctor's position relative to the entrepreneur (clue 9) and the french (clue 10), it's likely that the doctor is in position 6.
* Clues 22, 23, and 34 collectively tell us that the firefighter owns a fish and drives a bike. Given clue 5, which states that the firefighter is to the left of the person driving the bike, we can conclude that the firefighter is in position 3, and the person driving the bike is likely in an even position.
* The rest of the solution falls into place by applying the remaining clues and constraints.

#############


Here's how I solved it:

From clue 25, the Australian is watching comedy movies.

From clue 26, the Australian is to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the Australian is watching comedy movies, this means that the person watching martial-arts movies cannot be in position 1 or 2 (since there's no room for the Australian). Therefore, the person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 5 or 6.

From clue 10, either the Australian is the fan of gospel music or the Australian is watching western movies. But since we already know that the Australian is watching comedy movies, this means that the Australian cannot watch western movies. Therefore, the Australian must be the fan of gospel music.

From clue 22, the fan of gospel music and the Australian have the same parity positions (i.e., both are in even or odd positions). Since the Australian is in an odd position (position 2), this means that the fan of gospel music must also be in an odd position. Therefore, the fan of gospel music cannot be in position 1 (since it's already occupied by d&b) or position 3 (since there's no room for the Australian). This leaves only one possibility: the fan of gospel music is in position 5.

From clue 2, the person driving the snowmobile is not to the right of the person driving the bus. This means that the person driving the bus cannot be in position 1 or 2 (since there's no room for the snowmobile). Therefore, the person driving the bus must be in an odd position greater than 3.

From clue 24, the person driving the bus is in an odd position. Combining this with the previous conclusion, we know that the person driving the bus must be in either position 5 or position not-6 (since it's already occupied by time-travel).

But from clue 26, we also know that the Australian is to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the Australian is in position 2, this means that the person watching martial-arts movies must be in a higher odd position than 5 (since there's no room for the bus). This leaves only one possibility: the person watching martial-arts movies is in position not-6.

From clue 35, the fan of reggae and the person watching western movies have the same parity positions. Since the person watching western movies cannot be the Chinese (clue 29), this means that either the Japanese or Pakistani must watch western movies. But from clue 4, the Pakistani is on the far left or right, so it's more likely that the Japanese watches western movies.

From clue 20, the person watching comedy movies is on the left or right of the fan of pop music. Since we already know that the Australian is watching comedy movies and is in an odd position, this means that the fan of pop music must be in either position 3 (to the right of the Australian) or position not-4 (since there's no room for the bus).

From clue 27, the fan of pop music is to the right of the person driving the helicopter. Combining this with the previous conclusion, we know that the person driving the helicopter must be in either position 2 (to the left of the Australian) or position not-4.

But from clue 23, either the person driving the helicopter watches comedy movies or the Spanish is the person driving the helicopter. Since we already know that the Australian is watching comedy movies, this means that the Spanish cannot watch comedy movies and therefore must drive the helicopter.

The rest of the puzzle can be solved by making similar deductions using the remaining clues.
