Note: The solution was obtained by carefully analyzing the given clues and using a combination of logical deductions and eliminations.

Here are some key insights that helped me solve the puzzle:

* Clue 5 implies that the person eating raspberry and the person driving the car have the same parity positions. This means they must be in either both odd or both even positions.
* Clue 15 states that the person watching sports movies is in an even position. Since there are only three even positions (2, 4, and 6), this helps to constrain the possible placements of other elements.
* Clue 27 says that the person driving the van is somewhere between the fan salsa and the fan reggae. This implies that the van driver must be in an odd position (since salsa and reggae are on opposite sides of the table).
* Clue 28 states that the person driving the quad-bike is to the right of the person driving the jet-ski. This helps to establish a partial ordering for the transportation modes.

Using these insights, along with careful analysis of the remaining clues, I was able to construct the solution table above.

| Sport         | cricket       | soccer      | volleyball | climbing  | lacrosse   | parkour  |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

1. From clue 26, we know that the person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is climbing.
2. Clue 14 tells us that the person who's sport is soccer is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is dancing.
3. Using clues 10 and 26, we can deduce that the person who's sport is soccer must be in position 4 (since it can't be to the left of the fan classical).
4. Clue 36 tells us that the fan salsa and the person drinking 7up have the same parity positions, which means they are both odd or both even.
5. From clue 40, we know that the person drinking 7up is somewhere to the left of the person eating potato, so it must be in position 3 (since it can't be to the right of the fan salsa).
6. With the fan salsa and person drinking 7up in positions 2 and 3 respectively, clue 41 tells us that the person who's hobby is dancing must be in an even position.
7. From clues 5 and 24, we know that the person eating eggplant (who also drinks hot-chocolate) has a different parity position than the fan gospel. Therefore, they can't be in the same row as the fan salsa or fan classical.
8. Clue 16 tells us that the person eating eggplant is not to the right of the fan disco, so it must be in an odd position (either 1, 3, or 5).
9. The rest of the clues help fill in the remaining positions.

Note: I used a combination of manual reasoning and algorithmic techniques to solve this puzzle.
