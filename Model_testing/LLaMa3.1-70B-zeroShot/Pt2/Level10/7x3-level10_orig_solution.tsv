Lv10-7x3-2	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a possible solution:


|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |
| Beverage      | Iced-Tea      | Fanta        | Sprite     |
| Food          | Pumpkin       | Peas         | Avocado    |
| Hobby         | Rock-Climbing | Baking       | Hiking     |
| Job           | Architect     | Journalist   | Videographer|
| Music-Genre   | R&B           | Dubstep      | Punk        |
| Nationality   | Colombian     | German       | Canadian   |
| Transport     | Scooter       | Helicopter   | Quad-Bike  |

Let me explain the reasoning behind this solution:


From clue 10, we know that the fan of R&B is an architect. From clue 9, we also know that the fan of R&B and the Canadian have the same parity positions. This means that either both are in odd-numbered positions or both are in even-numbered positions.


Since the Canadian cannot be to the right of the person eating avocado (clue 17), and the person eating avocado is not the Canadian (clue 3), it's likely that the Canadian is in position 2. If so, then the fan of R&B must also be in an even-numbered position, which means they are in position 2.


From clue 14, we know that the person driving the scooter is an architect. Since there can only be one architect (clue 9), this means that the person driving the scooter and the fan of R&B are the same person.


Now, let's look at the beverage column. From clue 5, we know that the person drinking Sprite is somewhere to the right of the fan of Punk. Since there are only three columns, this means that the fan of Punk must be in either position 1 or 2.


From clue 6, we know that the fan of Punk is between the journalist and the person eating pumpkin. This means that the fan of Punk cannot be in position 3 (since there's no one to their right), so they must be in position 2.


However, this creates a conflict with our previous conclusion that the Canadian (and thus the fan of R&B) are in position 2. Therefore, we need to re-examine our assumptions.


Let's try placing the Canadian in position 3 instead. This means that the fan of R&B is also in an odd-numbered position. From clue 10, we know that the fan of R&B is an architect, and from clue 14, we know that the person driving the scooter is also an architect. Therefore, it's likely that the person driving the scooter is in position 1.


From clue 7, we know that the person driving the scooter is to the left of the person who's hobby is hiking. This means that the person whose hobby is hiking must be in either position 2 or 3.


Now, let's look at the food column. From clue 13, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is on the left or right of the person eating avocado. Since there are only three columns, this means that the person eating avocado cannot be in position 1 (since there's no one to their left).


From clue 2, we know that the person eating avocado and the person driving the quad-bike have different parity positions. This means that if the person eating avocado is in an odd-numbered position, then the person driving the quad-bike must be in an even-numbered position.


Since there are only three columns, this means that the person eating avocado cannot be in position 3 (since there's no one to their right). Therefore, the person eating avocado must be in position 2.


From clue 8, we know that the person driving the scooter is not to the right of the person eating avocado. This confirms our previous conclusion that the person driving the scooter is in position 1.


Now, let's look at the music-genre column. From clue 4, we know that the fan of Dubstep drives a helicopter. From clue 6, we know that the fan of Punk is between the journalist and the person eating pumpkin.


Since the person eating avocado is already in position 2, this means that the person eating pumpkin must be in either position 1 or 3.


However, from clue 5, we know that the person drinking Sprite is somewhere to the right of the fan of Punk. This means that the fan of Punk cannot be in position 3 (since there's no one to their right), so they must be in position 2.


But wait! We already concluded that the person eating avocado is in position 2!


This creates a conflict, which means we need to re-examine our assumptions again. Let's try placing the fan of Punk in position 1 instead.


From clue 6, we know that the fan of Punk is between the journalist and the person eating pumpkin. This means that the journalist must be in either position 2 or 3, and the person eating pumpkin must be in either position 1 or 2.


However, from clue 5, we know that the person drinking Sprite is somewhere to the right of the fan of Punk. This means that the person drinking Sprite cannot be in position 1 (since there's no one to their left).


Therefore, it's likely that the person drinking Sprite is in position 3.


Now, let's look at the job column. From clue 10, we know that the fan of R&B is an architect. Since the person driving the scooter is also an architect (clue 14), and they are not the same person (since one drives a scooter and the other doesn't), this means that there must be two architects.


However, this creates a conflict with our previous conclusion that there can only be one architect (clue 9). Therefore, we need to re-examine our assumptions again.


Let's try placing the fan of R&B in position 1 instead. From clue 10, we know that the fan of R&B is an architect, and from clue 14, we know that the person driving the scooter is also an architect.


However, this creates a conflict with our previous conclusion that the person driving the scooter drives a scooter (since they are now in position 1). Therefore, we need to re-examine our assumptions again.

After applying all the clues, I came up with the following solution:

| Food          | blueberry   | kale      | tomato    |

| Pet           | fish        | goldfish  | hamster   |
| Transport     | airplane    | trike     | taxi      |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:


From clue 9, we know that the person eating blueberry is to the left of the nigerian. Since there are only three nationalities, this means that the canadian must be in column 1.


Clue 11 tells us that the person eating kale is either driving the trike or is the canadian, but not both. Given that the canadian is already in column 1 and eating blueberry, this means that the person eating kale must be in column 2 and driving something else (which turns out to be the airplane).


From clue 4, we know that the japanese is not to the left of the nigerian, which means that the japanese must be in column 3.


Clue 5 tells us that the engineer is between the owner of the fish and the nigerian. Since the nigerian is already in column 3, this means that the engineer must be in column 2, and the owner of the fish must be in column 1.


From clue 14, we know that the person driving the taxi is on the far right (column 3).


Clue 8 tells us that the owner of the goldfish is to the left of the person watching superhero movies. Since there are only three pets, this means that the goldfish must be in column 2.


And so on... By applying all the clues, we can deduce the final solution table above.

#############


Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

1. From clue 10, we know that the person driving the taxi is in an odd position. Since there are only three positions, this means that the taxi driver must be in either position 1 or 3.

2. Clue 5 tells us that the British is not to the left of the person driving the taxi. This implies that the British cannot be in position 1 (since the taxi driver would be in an odd position).

3. From clue 15, we know that the British is on the right of the project-manager.

4. Clue 14 tells us that the person watching horror movies is on the left of the person watching action movies.

5. Using clues 2 and 3, we can deduce that the dressmaker (who's hobby is traveling) must be eating zucchini.

6. From clue 11, we know that the dressmaker and the person eating zucchini have the same parity positions. This implies that the dressmaker cannot be in position 1 or 3 (since zucchini would also need to be in an odd position).

7. Clue 9 tells us that the person eating lime is either watching horror movies or owns a hedgehog, but not both.

8. By combining clues 4 and 14, we can conclude that the person eating lime must be watching horror movies (since the action movie watcher cannot be to the right of the horror movie watcher).

9. Clue 1 tells us that the person eating lime is on the left of the dressmaker. This implies that the lime eater is in position 1.

10. Clue 12 tells us that the bartender is not watching horror movies. By combining this with clue 18, we can conclude that the bartender must be owning a chinchilla (since it cannot be traveling).

11. Using clues 6 and 17, we can deduce that the owner of the cat is in position 3.

12. Clue 16 tells us that the Mexican and the owner of the chinchilla have different parity positions. Since the bartender owns a chinchilla (in an odd position), this implies that the Mexican must be in an even position, i.e., position 2.

13. From clue 8, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is not the Mexican.

14. Clue 7 tells us that the person eating strawberry is not to the right of the owner of the chinchilla. This implies that the strawberry eater cannot be in position 3 (since it would need to be on the left of the chinchilla).

15. By combining clues 6 and 11, we can conclude that the project-manager must be in an even position, i.e., position 2.

16. Clue 13 tells us that the person driving the trike is not to the right of the person driving the taxi. This implies that the trike driver cannot be in position 3 (since it would need to be on the left of the taxi).

17. From clue 6, we know that the person driving the trike is somewhere between the person watching time-travel movies and the owner of the chinchilla.

18. By combining clues 16 and 17, we can conclude that the person driving the trike must be in position 2.

19. Clue 5 tells us that the British is on the right of the project-manager. This implies that the British cannot be in position 1 (since it would need to be on the left of the project-manager).

20. By combining clues 3 and 15, we can conclude that the British must be in position 2.

After applying all these deductions, I arrived at the solution table above.

. 

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

* From clue 16, we know that juice is on either the far left or far right. Since water can't be on the far right (clue 9), juice must be in position 1 or 3.
* From clue 5, if dutch is not with apricot, then dutch is with tennis, which means indian and nigerian are together, but this contradicts clue 4. So, dutch must be with apricot (position 2).
* From clue 8, the person who's hobby is gardening is dutch, so it must be in position 2.
* From clue 14, writing can't be to the left of tennis, and since juice is on either side, writing must be in position 1.
* From clue 6, collecting is to the left of 7up (which we know from clue 1 is with cabbage). So, collecting is in position 2.
* From clue 10, water is to the left of writing, so it's in position 1.
* The rest of the positions can be filled in using the remaining clues.

| Transport     | Bus        | Scooter    | Motorbike   |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 1, we know that the person eating cucumber is to the right of the fan house. From clue 5, we know that the fan house drinks 7up.


From clue 2, we know that the Thai is to the right of the nurse. From clue 13, we know that the Thai is also to the right of the owner of the horse.


From clue 3, we have two possible scenarios: either the nurse owns the horse or the Argentine owns the horse. However, from clue 16, we know that the owner of the horse and the fan house have the same parity positions, which means they must be in either columns 1 and 2 or columns 2 and 3. Since the nurse is already determined to be in column 1 (from clue 2), the Argentine must own the horse.


From clue 4, we know that the firefighter and the person driving the scooter have different parity positions. From clue 12, we know that the person driving the scooter is not to the right of the photographer.


Combining these clues, we can start building a partial solution:


|               |      1      |    2     |      3       |
| Beverage      |             | 7up       |              |

| Transport     |             | Scooter    | Motorbike   |

We can continue filling in the blanks using the remaining clues:


From clue 6, we know that the fan disco and the person driving the bus have different parity positions.


From clue 7, we know that the owner of the snake is between the person driving the motorbike and the person driving the bus.


From clue 8, we know that the owner of the snake is to the left of the person driving the motorbike.


Combining these clues, we can determine that the owner of the snake drives the bus (since they are in different parity positions) and the fan disco drives the motorbike.


We also know from clue 15 that the owner of the snake is to the left of the Thai. Since the Argentine owns the horse, which is to the left of the Thai (from clue 13), the owner of the snake must be the Mexican.


From clue 10, we know that the fan disco is to the left of the owner of the ferret. Therefore, the fan disco drives the motorbike and the owner of the ferret drives the scooter.


Finally, from clue 11, we know that the person drinking juice is between the Argentine and the person eating apricot.


With all these clues combined, we arrive at the final solution:

|               |      1      |      2      |      3      |
| Beverage      |             | Tea         | Lemonade    |

| Nationality   | Australian  | Canadian    | Dutch      |
| Transport     | Helicopter  | Quad-Bike  | Airplane    |

 

Now, from clue 15, we know the person eating cauliflower is not the canadian.


Let's combine these clues:


|               |      1      |      2      |      3      |
| Beverage      |             | Tea         | Lemonade    |

| Nationality   | Australian  | Canadian    | Dutch      |
| Transport     | Helicopter  | Quad-Bike  | Airplane    |

 

Now, from clue 16 and 17, we know the person who's hobby is woodworking is not to the left of the person driving the helicopter or the mechanic.


Let's combine these clues:


|               |      1      |      2      |      3      |
| Beverage      | Iced-Tea    | Tea         | Lemonade    |

After analyzing all the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############

|               |       1       |     2     |      3      |

#############


Here's how I derived the solution:


From clue 1, the Spanish person is on the left of the Pakistani.


From clue 9, the fan of folk music is on the left of the fan of salsa music.


Combining these two clues, we can deduce that the Spanish person likes folk music and is in position 1.


From clue 13, the owner of the hamster is in an even position (2 or none, since there are only three positions). This means the owner of the hamster must be in position 2, as position 1 is already occupied by the Spanish person.


Clue 4 states that the owner of the hamster and the person who's hobby is singing have the same parity positions. Since the owner of the hamster is in an even position (2), the person who likes singing must also be in an even position, which means they are in position 3 (none left).


From clue 10, the person who's hobby is video-games is the owner of the frog.


Clue 7 states that the person driving the roller is not to the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the roller cannot be in position 1 (as it would be to the left of the cooker), and the taxi must be between the car and the video-gamer (clue 8), we can deduce that the roller is in position 2, which means the person who's hobby is cooking is in position 3.


However, this creates a contradiction with clue 11, as the cooker would then be to the right of the lacrosse player. Therefore, our initial assumption about the roller must be incorrect.


Revisiting clue 7, we realize that it only restricts the relative positions of the roller and the cooker but doesn't specify their exact positions. Let's try placing the roller in position 3 instead:


Now, from clue 8, the taxi must be between the car and the video-gamer (who owns the frog). This means the car is in position 1, the taxi is in position 2, and the roller is in position 3.


However, this contradicts our earlier conclusion that the owner of the hamster is in position 2. Therefore, we need to reevaluate our assumptions.


Let's go back to clue 4: the owner of the hamster and the person who likes singing have the same parity positions (both even or both odd). This means they cannot be in consecutive positions. Since there are only three positions, one of them must be in position 1 and the other in position 3.


We already know that the Spanish person is in position 1. Now we can conclude that the owner of the hamster is not in position 1 but rather in position 2 (even), which means the person who likes singing is in position 3 (odd).


From clue 5, the person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the owner of the pony.


Now we have:


|               |       1       |     2     |      3      |
| Beverage      |               |           |             |
| Hobby         | cooking       | video-games| singing      |
| Music-Genre   | folk          | rock        | salsa        |
| Nationality   | spanish       | pakistani   | australian    |
| Pet           |               | hamster     | pony         |
| Sport         |               | lacrosse    | swimming     |
| Transport     | car           | roller      | taxi         |


From clue 10, the person who's hobby is video-games owns the frog.


However, this creates a conflict with our earlier conclusion that the owner of the hamster is in position 2. Therefore, we need to reevaluate our assumptions about the pets:


Let's go back to clue 13: the owner of the hamster is in an even position (2 or none). We already concluded that the person who likes singing is in position 3. Now, we can deduce that the owner of the hamster must be in position 2.


From clue 10, the video-gamer owns the frog, which means the person who's hobby is cooking owns the pony (since there are only three pets).


Now we have:


|               |       1       |     2     |      3      |
| Beverage      |               |           |             |
| Hobby         | cooking       | video-games| singing      |
| Music-Genre   | folk          | rock        | salsa        |
| Nationality   | spanish       | pakistani   | australian    |
| Pet           | pony          | hamster     | frog         |
| Sport         |               | lacrosse    | swimming     |
| Transport     | car           | roller      | taxi         |


From clue 2, the fan of rock music is on the left or right of the person who's sport is lacrosse.


Combining this with clue 14, we can deduce that the fan of rock music must be in position 2 (on the right of lacrosse) since they are already to the right of the folk fan.


From clue 3, the salsa fan is either the weightlifter or the juice drinker. However, if the salsa fan were the weightlifter, it would create a contradiction with clue 6 (the salsa fan cannot be to the left of the Pakistani). Therefore, the salsa fan must be the juice drinker.


Now we have:


|               |       1       |     2     |      3      |
| Beverage      |               |           |             |
| Hobby         | cooking       | video-games| singing      |
| Music-Genre   | folk          | rock        | salsa        |
| Nationality   | spanish       | pakistani   | australian    |
| Pet           | pony          | hamster     | frog         |
| Sport         |               | lacrosse    | swimming     |
| Transport     | car           | roller      | taxi         |

From clue 12, the weightlifter is to the left of the person driving the taxi.


Since the salsa fan (juice drinker) cannot be in position 1 (as they would then be to the left of the Pakistani), we can conclude that the juice drinker must be in position 3.


Now we have:


|               |       1       |     2     |      3      |
| Beverage      |               |           | juice        |
| Hobby         | cooking       | video-games| singing      |
| Music-Genre   | folk          | rock        | salsa        |
| Nationality   | spanish       | pakistani   | australian    |
| Pet           | pony          | hamster     | frog         |
| Sport         |               | lacrosse    | swimming     |
| Transport     | car           | roller      | taxi         |

The final piece of the puzzle is to determine the beverages:


From clue 5, the person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the pony owner.


Since the juice drinker is already in position 3, we can conclude that the pony owner drinks coffee (which doesn't matter) or tea. However, since the salsa fan (juice drinker) cannot be to the left of the Pakistani, we know that the Pakistani must be in position 2.


Now we have:


|               |       1       |     2     |      3      |
| Beverage      |               |           | juice        |
| Hobby         | cooking       | video-games| singing      |
| Music-Genre   | folk          | rock        | salsa        |
| Nationality   | spanish       | pakistani   | australian    |
| Pet           | pony          | hamster     | frog         |
| Sport         |               | lacrosse    | swimming     |
| Transport     | car           | roller      | taxi         |

From clue 5, the person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the pony owner.


Now we can conclude that the pony owner drinks coffee (which doesn't matter) or tea. However, since the salsa fan (juice drinker) cannot be to the left of the Pakistani, we know that the Pakistani must be in position 2.


Since the person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the pony owner, it means that the pony owner drinks something else, and the only option left is coffee.


Now we have:


|               |       1       |     2     |      3      |
| Beverage      |               |           | juice        |
| Hobby         | cooking       | video-games| singing      |
| Music-Genre   | folk          | rock        | salsa        |
| Nationality   | spanish       | pakistani   | australian    |
| Pet           | pony          | hamster     | frog         |
| Sport         |               | lacrosse    | swimming     |
| Transport     | car           | roller      | taxi         |

The final step is to fill in the remaining blanks:


From clue 12, the weightlifter is to the left of the person driving the taxi.


Since we already know that the salsa fan (juice drinker) must be in position 3 and cannot be the weightlifter, we can conclude that the weightlifter must be in position 1.


Now we have:


|               |       1       |     2     |      3      |
| Beverage      |               |           | juice        |
| Hobby         | cooking       | video-games| singing      |
| Music-Genre   | folk          | rock        | salsa        |
| Nationality   | spanish       | pakistani   | australian    |
| Pet           | pony          | hamster     | frog         |
| Sport         | weightlifting | lacrosse    | swimming     |
| Transport     | car           | roller      | taxi         |

The only remaining blank is the beverage for position 1:


Since we already know that the juice drinker is in position 3 and cannot be the coffee drinker, we can conclude that the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 2.


Now we have:


|               |       1       |     2     |      3      |
| Beverage      |               | iced-tea   | juice        |
| Hobby         | cooking       | video-games| singing      |
| Music-Genre   | folk          | rock        | salsa        |
| Nationality   | spanish       | pakistani   | australian    |
| Pet           | pony          | hamster     | frog         |
| Sport         | weightlifting | lacrosse    | swimming     |
| Transport     | car           | roller      | taxi         |

The final piece of the puzzle is to determine the beverage for position 1:


Since we already know that the person drinking iced-tea is in position 2 and the juice drinker is in position 3, we can conclude that the only remaining option for position 1 is coffee.


Therefore, the solution is:


|               |       1       |     2     |      3      |
| Beverage      | coffee        | iced-tea   | juice        |
| Hobby         | cooking       | video-games| singing      |
| Music-Genre   | folk          | rock        | salsa        |
| Nationality   | spanish       | pakistani   | australian    |
| Pet           | pony          | hamster     | frog         |
| Sport         | weightlifting | lacrosse    | swimming     |
| Transport     | car           | roller      | taxi         |
