#############

Note: The solution is based on the given clues and may not be unique. However, this solution satisfies all the conditions specified in the puzzle.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 55, we know that the fan gospel is in an odd position.
2. Clue 33 states that the fan country is on the left or right of the fan gospel.
3. Clue 38 says that the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left or right of the fan country.
4. From clue 41, we know that the person driving the trike is on the right of the fan blues.
5. Clue 42 states that the fan blues is the person drinking mirinda.
6. Using these clues, we can start filling in the table.

Once you have a few positions filled in, you can use the other clues to make educated guesses and narrow down the possibilities.

For example:

* Clue 44 helps us determine the relationship between the person driving the car and the person drinking soy-milk.
* Clue 49 provides a constraint on the position of the person driving the car relative to the person who's sport is rowing.
* Clue 48 gives us information about the position of the person drinking hot-chocolate.

By iteratively applying these clues, we can fill in the entire table and arrive at the solution."
