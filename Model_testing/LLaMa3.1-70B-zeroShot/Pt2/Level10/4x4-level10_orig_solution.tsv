Lv10-4x4-2	"Here is the solved puzzle:


|               |     1     |        2        |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage      | milk      | 7up             | soy-milk | iced-tea   |
| Food          | spinach   | blueberry       | carrot   | strawberry |
| Job           | journalist| project-manager | chef     | doctor     |
| Movie-Genre   | animation | disaster         | mystery  | satire     |

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

From clue 16, we know that the person drinking milk is in an even position. Since there are only two even positions (2 and 4), and from clue 2, we know that the person watching animation movies is to the right of the person drinking milk, the person drinking milk must be in position 2.

From clue 1, we know that the person watching animation movies is not to the left of the person watching satire movies. Therefore, the person watching animation movies must be in position 1 or 3. But from clue 14, we know that either the person watching animation movies is the journalist or the person drinking 7up. Since the person drinking milk is already in an even position, the person drinking 7up cannot be the person watching animation movies (because it would mean two people are in even positions). Therefore, the person watching animation movies must be the journalist.

Now we can place the journalist and the person drinking milk:

|               |     1     |        2        |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage      |           | milk            |          |            |
| Food          |           |                 |          |            |
| Job           | journalist|                 |          |            |
| Movie-Genre   | animation |                 |          | satire     |

From clue 9, we know that the person watching satire movies is on the right of the person drinking 7up. And from clue 11, we know that the person watching disaster movies and the person drinking 7up have the same parity positions. Therefore, the person drinking 7up must be in an odd position (1 or 3), and the person watching disaster movies must also be in an odd position.

From clue 15, we know that the person drinking 7up and the person eating blueberry have the same parity positions. Since the person drinking 7up is in an odd position, the person eating blueberry must also be in an odd position.

Now we can place the person drinking 7up and the person eating blueberry:

|               |     1     |        2        |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage      |           | milk            | 7up       |            |
| Food          |           |                 | blueberry |            |
| Job           | journalist|                 |          |            |
| Movie-Genre   | animation |                 | disaster  | satire     |

From clue 10, we know that the person eating blueberry is not the person drinking iced-tea. Therefore, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 4.

Now we can place the person drinking iced-tea:

|               |     1     |        2        |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage      |           | milk            | 7up       | iced-tea   |
| Food          |           |                 | blueberry |            |
| Job           | journalist|                 |          |            |
| Movie-Genre   | animation |                 | disaster  | satire     |

From clue 13, we know that the person watching mystery movies is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person watching satire movies. Therefore, the person watching mystery movies must be in position 3 or 2.

From clue 7, we know that the person watching mystery movies is either the person eating spinach or the person drinking 7up, but not both. Since the person drinking 7up is already in an odd position, the person watching mystery movies cannot be the person drinking 7up. Therefore, the person watching mystery movies must be the person eating spinach.

Now we can place the person watching mystery movies and the person eating spinach:

|               |     1     |        2        |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage      |           | milk            | 7up       | iced-tea   |
| Food          | spinach   |                 | blueberry |            |
| Job           | journalist|                 |          |            |
| Movie-Genre   | animation | mystery         | disaster  | satire     |

From clue 5, we know that the project-manager is on the right of the doctor. And from clue 4, we know that the person drinking 7up is not the person eating carrot. Therefore, the person eating carrot must be in position 2 or 3.

Now we can place the person eating carrot and the project-manager:

|               |     1     |        2        |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage      |           | milk            | 7up       | iced-tea   |
| Food          | spinach   | blueberry       | carrot    |            |
| Job           | journalist| project-manager | chef     | doctor     |
| Movie-Genre   | animation | mystery         | disaster  | satire     |

From clue 12, we know that the person eating carrot is somewhere between the chef and the doctor. Therefore, the chef must be in position 3.

Now we can place the chef:

|               |     1     |        2        |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage      |           | milk            | soy-milk  | iced-tea   |
| Food          | spinach   | blueberry       | carrot    | strawberry |
| Job           | journalist| project-manager | chef     | doctor     |
| Movie-Genre   | animation | disaster         | mystery  | satire     |

Finally, from clue 3, we know that the doctor and the person drinking soy-milk have the same parity positions. Since the doctor is in an even position (4), the person drinking soy-milk must also be in an even position.

Now we can place the person drinking soy-milk:

|               |     1     |        2        |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage      | milk      | 7up             | soy-milk | iced-tea   |
| Food          | spinach   | blueberry       | carrot   | strawberry |
| Job           | journalist| project-manager | chef     | doctor     |
| Movie-Genre   | animation | disaster         | mystery  | satire     |

And from clue 18, we know that the person eating strawberry is on the far right.

Therefore, the final solution is:

Lv10-4x4-3	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:

|               |     1     |    2     |      3      |    4     |
| Hobby         | Chess     | Traveling| Singing     | Fishing   |

| Nationality   | Polish    | British  | Nigerian    | Egyptian  |
| Pet           | Turtle    | Lizard   | Ferret      | Horse     |

#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 2, we know the person watching sports movies is not the person who's hobby is fishing. Combining this with clue 12, we can conclude that the person watching sports movies must be the person who's hobby is traveling.
* Clue 6 tells us the person who's hobby is chess is between the owner of the turtle and the person watching animation movies. Since the person watching animation movies cannot be in position 1 (due to clue 5), we can place the person who's hobby is chess in position 1, with the owner of the turtle in position 2.
* Clue 14 places the owner of the lizard between the owner of the turtle and the British. Therefore, the British must be in position 4, and the owner of the lizard in position 3.
* Clue 9 tells us the person who's hobby is singing is on the right of the Nigerian. Since the person watching sports movies (traveling) is already placed, we can place the person who's hobby is singing in position 3, with the Nigerian in position 2 or 4. However, due to clue 7, the Nigerian cannot be in position 4, so they must be in position 2.
* Clue 10 places the Egyptian and the owner of the ferret in the same parity positions (even). Since the person watching disaster movies is already placed in an even position (due to clue 1), we can place the Egyptian in position 4, with the owner of the ferret in position 2 or 4. However, due to clue 11, the Nigerian and the person who's hobby is fishing have the same parity positions, so the owner of the ferret must be in position 3.
* Clue 8 tells us the British is not to the left of the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the British is already placed in position 4, we can confirm that the person who's hobby is traveling is indeed in position 2.

The rest of the puzzle falls into place using the remaining clues."

| Sport         | lacrosse | tennis   | water-polo | climbing     |

Here's how I arrived at the solution:


From clue 1, we know that the person who likes tennis is the owner of the frog. From clue 7, we know that this person is on the right of the person watching drama movies.


Clue 4 tells us that the person watching thriller movies is on the right of the owner of the dog. Clue 9 says that the person watching thriller movies is to the left of the fan gospel.


From clue 8, we know that the person watching mystery movies is between the owner of the dog and the owner of the chinchilla. Clue 6 tells us that the owner of the chinchilla is either the fan punk or the person who likes water-polo, but not both.


Putting all these clues together, we can start filling in the table:


|               |    ?     |    ?     |     frog   |      ?      |

| Sport         | ?        | tennis   | water-polo | climbing     |


Now, using clue 10, we know that the person who likes lacrosse and the owner of the pony have different parity positions. This means that lacrosse must be in position 1 or 3.


Clue 2 tells us that the fan dubstep is not to the left of the person who likes tennis. Therefore, dubstep must be in position 2.


Using clue 11, we know that the fan r&b is not the person who likes water-polo. This means that r&b must be in position 1.


Now we can fill in the rest of the table:


|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |      4      |

Lv10-4x4-5	"I'll solve the logic puzzle step by step.


From clue 1, we know that the person watching scientific movies is to the right of the person drinking coffee.

From clue 10, we know that the person drinking coffee is not watching fantasy movies.

From clue 5, we know that the american is not to the right of the person watching scientific movies.

Combining these clues, we can deduce that the person drinking coffee is in position 1, and they are not american (since the american is not to the right of the scientific movie watcher).

|               |    1    |    2     |     3      |     4      |
| Beverage      | Coffee  |          |            |            |

| Nationality   |         |          |            |            |
| Sport         |         |          |            |            |

From clue 2, we know that the person drinking juice is between the person watching zombie movies and the person drinking sprite.

From clue 11, we know that the person watching zombie movies is to the right of the person drinking coffee.

Since the person drinking juice is to the left of the mexican (clue 8), the mexican cannot be in position 1. Also, the italian has the same parity as the zombie movie watcher (clue 15), so the italian must be in an even-numbered position.

From clue 7, we know that the person drinking juice is not to the left of the person drinking milk.

Combining these clues, we can deduce that:

|               |    1    |    2     |     3      |     4      |
| Beverage      | Coffee  | Juice    |            | Sprite     |

| Nationality   |         | Mexican  |            |            |
| Sport         |         |          |            |            |

From clue 3, we know that the person who's sport is biathlon is either the person drinking sprite or the person watching scientific movies.

Since the person who's sport is climbing and the person watching scientific movies have different parity positions (clue 4), the person watching scientific movies must be in an odd-numbered position. Therefore, the biathlon sport cannot be with the scientific movie watcher.

The person drinking sprite must be the one with the biathlon sport.

From clue 6, we know that the person who's sport is ice-hockey is to the right of the american.

Since the italian has the same parity as the zombie movie watcher (clue 15), and the italian cannot be in position 1 (since coffee is not american), the italian must be in position 2. Also, the american must be in an odd-numbered position.

From clue 14, we know that the person who's sport is climbing is not to the right of the american. Therefore, the american must be in position 3.

Combining these clues, we can deduce that:

|               |    1    |    2     |     3      |     4      |
| Beverage      | Coffee  | Juice    |            | Sprite     |
| Movie-Genre   | Fantasy |          | Zombie     | Scientific|
| Nationality   | Polish  | Italian  | American   | Mexican    |
| Sport         | Climbing| Ice-Hockey|            | Biathlon   |

From clue 9, we know that the person who's sport is climbing is on the left or right of the person who's sport is biathlon.

The only remaining position for climbing is in position 1.

Combining these clues, we can deduce that:

Lv10-4x4-7	"I'll solve the logic puzzle step by step.

From clue 4, we know that rock-climbing is on the left of photography.
From clue 2, we know that photography is between rock-climbing and skydiving.
So, the order for hobbies is: rock-climbing, photography, skydiving.

From clue 1, we know that cauliflower and puzzles have different parity positions.
Since there are only four people, this means that cauliflower must be in an odd position (1 or 3) and puzzles must be in an even position (2 or 4).

From clue 6, we know that photography is to the left of cauliflower.
So, the order for hobbies and food is: rock-climbing, photography, ..., cauliflower.

From clue 9, we know that potato is either subway or puzzles, but not both.
Since puzzles must be in an even position (2 or 4), potato can't be in position 1.
Also, since subway is watching thriller movies (clue 12), potato can't be in position 3 (because skydiving is between potato and thriller movies, clue 10).
So, potato must be in position 2.

Now we have:

|               |       1       |      2      |      3      |    4     |
| Food          | rock-         | potato     |            |          |
| Hobby         | climbing      | puzzles    |            |          |
| Movie-Genre   |               |             |             |          |
| Transport     |               | subway     |             |          |

From clue 5, we know that avocado is not to the right of grapes.
Since rock-climbing must be in position 1 (because it's on the left of photography), avocado or grapes must be in position 3.

From clue 11, we know that avocado and spy movies have the same parity positions.
Since spy movies are on the left of superhero movies (clue 8), spy movies must be in an even position (2).
So, avocado can't be in position 3 (because it would have a different parity position than spy movies).

Now we have:

|               |       1       |      2      |      3      |    4     |
| Food          | rock-         | potato     | grapes     |          |
| Hobby         | climbing      | puzzles    |            |          |
| Movie-Genre   | spy           |             |             |          |
| Transport     |               | subway     |             |          |

From clue 10, we know that skydiving is between potato and thriller movies.
Since photography must be in position 3 (because it's between rock-climbing and skydiving), this means that thriller movies can't be in position 2 or 4.

Now we have:

|               |       1       |      2      |      3      |    4     |
| Food          | rock-         | potato     | grapes     | avocado |
| Hobby         | climbing      | puzzles    | photography| skydiving|
| Movie-Genre   | spy           | thriller   |             |          |
| Transport     |               | subway     |             |          |

From clue 3, we know that the person driving the van is not to the left of the person driving the skateboard.
Since the person driving the taxi is to the right of superhero movies (clue 13), and superhero movies are on the right of spy movies (clue 8), this means that the van can't be in position 1 or 2.

Now we have:

|               |       1       |      2      |      3      |    4     |

| Transport     | skateboard    | subway     | taxi       | van      |

From clue 7, we know that the person driving the van is not to the left of the person watching superhero movies.
Since the van is in position 4, this means that superhero movies must be in position 3.

Now we have:

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* Clue 10 and clue 6 helped me determine that the person watching romance movies is on the far left (1) or far right (4). Since the person who's hobby is cooking can't be both, they must be drinking lemonade.
* Clue 2 placed the baking hobby to the left of fanta.
* Clue 3 and clue 8 established that the french is between the british and the video-games hobby.
* Clue 5 identified the american as watching superhero movies.
* Clue 11 linked sudoku with epic movies.
* Clues 7, 9, and 14 helped place the documentary movie watcher to the right of cooking, which in turn placed the person drinking lemonade on position 1.
* Clue 13 and clue 12 ensured that baking (position 1) and american (position 4) have different parity positions.
* The remaining clues were used to fine-tune the placement of beverages, hobbies, movie genres, and nationalities.

Lv10-4x4-10	"I'll solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 10, we know that the person who's sport is golf is in an even position, so it must be either position 2 or 4.

From clue 11, we know that the person who's sport is golf is on the left of the person eating lemon. Since golf is in an even position, lemon must be in an odd position (3).

From clue 5, we know that the person who's sport is parkour and the person eating lemon have the same parity positions. Therefore, parkour must also be in an odd position.

From clue 13, we know that the person eating cherry is on the left or right of the person who's sport is parkour. Since parkour is in an odd position (1 or 3), cherry must be in a nearby position (1, 2, or 4).

Now let's look at the beverage clues.

From clue 2, we know that the person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda.

From clue 4, we know that the person drinking tea is not to the right of the person eating papaya. This implies that tea must be in a position before or at the same position as papaya.

From clue 6, we know that the person eating papaya is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer. Therefore, papaya must be in an odd position (3).

Now let's combine our findings:

* Golf: even position (2 or 4)
* Lemon: odd position (3)
* Parkour: odd position (1 or 3)
* Cherry: nearby parkour (1, 2, or 4)
* Tea: left of mirinda and not right of papaya
* Papaya: odd position (3)

The only way to satisfy these conditions is:

Golf: position 2
Lemon: position 3
Parkour: position 3 (wait, no! parkour can't be in the same position as lemon!)
Let's try again.

Golf: position 4
Lemon: position 3
Parkour: position 1

Now let's look at the hobby clues.

From clue 8, we know that the person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is camping.

From clue 12, we know that the person who's hobby is reading is not to the left of the person drinking soy-milk. This implies that reading must be in a position after or at the same position as soy-milk.

From clue 15, we know that the person eating garlic is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is reading.

Now let's combine our findings:

* Golf: position 4
* Lemon: position 3
* Parkour: position 1
* Sudoku: next to camping (can't be in position 1)
* Soy-milk: before or at same position as reading
* Garlic: left of reading

The only way to satisfy these conditions is:

Sudoku: position 2
Camping: position 3 (no, wait! lemon is already there!)
Let's try again.

Sudoku: position 4 (no, wait! golf is already there!)
Let's try again.

Sudoku: not possible in position 1 or 3... how about position 2 doesn't work...

Hmm, this is tricky!

Wait a minute... what if sudoku is in position 3? No, that can't be right... unless...

Unless lemon and parkour are swapped! Then we can have:

Parkour: position 3
Lemon: position 1

Now let's re-examine the clues.

* Golf: position 4
* Parkour: position 3
* Lemon: position 1
* Sudoku: next to camping (must be in position 2 or 4)
* Soy-milk: before or at same position as reading
* Garlic: left of reading

 Ah-ha! Now we can solve it!
