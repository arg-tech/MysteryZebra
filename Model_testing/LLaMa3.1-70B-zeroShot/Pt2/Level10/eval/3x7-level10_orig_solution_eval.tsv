After carefully analyzing all 37 clues, I came up with a possible solution:

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* Clue 16 tells us that the Dutch person eats pineapple, which can only be in position 7.
* Clue 35 tells us that the scooter is on the far left or right. Given the constraints, it must be on the far left (position 1).
* Clue 2 tells us that the Dutch person is on the far left or far right. Since they're already in position 7, this clue doesn't add much new information.
* Clues 11 and 23 tell us that the tram can't be to the right of broccoli. Given the constraints, the tram must be in position 3.
* Clue 33 tells us that the Chinese person is to the left of the person eating broccoli. This means the Chinese person must be in position 2 or 3, but since the tram is already in position 3, they must be in position 2 (but then we need to swap them with the Malaysian).
* Clues 20 and 34 tell us that the van is between the roller and the Thai person. Given the constraints, this means the van must be in position 2.
* ...and so on.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


From clues 2 and 8, we know the person eating avocado is to the left of the person eating eggplant, and the architect or the tram driver eats avocado. From clue 27, we know the tram driver eats apricot, so the architect must eat avocado.


Clue 9 states that the firefighter is in the middle, which means the helicopter driver (clue 7) and the firefighter are in positions 4 and 3 or vice versa. Clues 10 and 25 also place the person eating grapes in the middle.


From clues 5 and 26, we can deduce the order of the train and snowmobile drivers. Clue 17 states that the tram driver is not to the left of the person driving the snowmobile.

Explanation:

The solution was found by applying the given rules one by one. The rules were used to narrow down the possible positions of each beverage, movie-genre and nationality.

Some key deductions that helped in solving the puzzle are:

* From rule 2, we know that action movies is at an even position.
* From rule 9, fantasy movies is on the right of action movies.
* From rule 22, fantasy movies is between mirinda and dutch.
* From rule 27, superhero movies is fanta.

Using these deductions and other rules, we can start filling in the table.

Lv10-3x7-9	"Here is the solved puzzle:

| Sport   | biathlon     | volleyball | rugby   | basketball  | golf       | lacrosse  | skateboarding |

Here's how I solved it:

From clue 25, the accountant is on the right of the teacher. From clue 4, the accountant is not to the right of the person eating watermelon.

From clue 27, the person eating cherry is the teacher. So the teacher must be in an odd position (clue 5). Since the teacher and the person eating watermelon have different parity positions (clue 21), the person eating watermelon must be in an even position.

From clue 13, the person who's sport is basketball is in an even position. From clue 11, the person eating asparagus is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is basketball. So the person eating asparagus must be in an odd position (5 or 7).

From clue 28, the architect and the person who's sport is basketball have different parity positions. Since the architect is not the teacher (clue 18), the architect must be in an odd position.

From clue 23, the person eating asparagus is on the right of the architect. So the architect must be in position 5 or 3. But since the person eating nectarine is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is rugby (clue 12), and the person eating watermelon is not to the left of the person who's sport is rugby (clue 1), the architect must be in position 3.

From clue 22, the person who's sport is volleyball is on the left or right of the person eating watermelon. Since the person eating watermelon is in an even position, the person who's sport is volleyball must be in an odd position (1 or 5). But since the teacher is not the person eating peas (clue 24), and the teacher is in an odd position, the person who's sport is volleyball must be in position 2.

From clue 26, the teacher is somewhere between the electrician and the person who's sport is basketball. Since the accountant is on the right of the teacher (clue 25), the accountant must be to the right of the person who's sport is basketball. So the person who's sport is basketball must be in position 4.

From clue 8, the dancer is on the right of the architect. Since the dancer is not the person eating asparagus (clue 20), and the dancer is on the left of the electrician (clue 17), the dancer must be in position 2 or 3. But since the teacher is in position 2, the dancer must be in position 4, which is occupied by the person who's sport is basketball. So the dancer must be in position 3.

From clue 10, the firefighter is the person who's sport is biathlon or the firefighter is the person eating cauliflower, but not both. Since the person eating cauliflower and the teacher have the same parity positions (clue 18), the firefighter must be the person who's sport is biathlon.

From clue 30, the accountant is the person eating peas or the accountant is the person who's sport is skateboarding, but not both. Since the person eating peas is on the left of the doctor (clue 7), and the doctor is not the person who's sport is lacrosse (clue 19), the accountant must be in position 6.
