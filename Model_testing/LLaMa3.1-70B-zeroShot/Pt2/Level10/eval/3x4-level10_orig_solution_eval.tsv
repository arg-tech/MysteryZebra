Lv10-3x4-1	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a possible solution:


|               |      1      |    2    |      3      |     4     |
| Beverage      |  Almond-milk |  Coffee |     Fanta   |   Sprite  |
| Hobby         |   Drawing    | Photography | Singing | Skydiving|
| Music-Genre   |    Ambient   |    Indie  |      Pop   |   Blues  |

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning:

From clue 1, we know that Almond-milk and Drawing go together.

Clue 9 states that Fanta is in an even position, so it must be either 2 or 4. Clue 3 says that Fanta is on the left or right of Pop, which means Fanta cannot be in position 1 or 3 (as there's no Pop to its left/right). So, Fanta must be in position 4.

Clue 8 states that Almond-milk is somewhere to the left of Pop. Since Fanta is already in position 4, and Almond-milk can't be next to Fanta, it means Almond-milk must be in position 1.

From clue 2, we know Coffee cannot be to the left of Fanta (which is in position 4). Therefore, Coffee must be in either position 2 or 3. However, clue 10 states that Photography is between Coffee and Ambient. Since Ambient can't be next to Fanta (due to clue 6), Ambient must be in position 1. But we already have Almond-milk there! So, Ambient must actually be in position 3.

Given the above information, and using clues 5, 7, and 10, we can deduce that Indie goes with Photography (clue 10) in position 2, Singing goes with Fanta (clues 5 and 7) in position 4, and Blues is left for Skydiving in position... well, actually, Blues has no other choice but to be next to Ambient (which is not directly adjacent to Fanta), so it must be in position 3. But wait, we already have Ambient there! This means Blues can't go with Skydiving after all; instead, it goes with Photography's ""neighbor"" which doesn't work... unless it goes with Almond-milk! Since Almond-milk is already paired with Drawing, this forces Indie to be in position 2 (not a bad thing!), leaving only the slot between Coffee and Ambient for Blues' actual hobby. Thus, we conclude that Skydiving's genre must indeed be Blues.


|               |      1      |    2    |      3      |     4     |

| Hobby         |   Drawing    | Photography |  Skydiving | Singing |
| Music-Genre   |    Ambient   |   Indie   |    Blues    |   Pop   |

Wait, this still doesn't satisfy all the clues!

Let's try another combination. We had Coffee and Fanta correctly placed relative to each other in the previous solution, but we didn't use it well enough.


|               |      1      |    2    |      3      |     4     |

| Hobby         |   Drawing    | Skydiving | Photography | Singing |
| Music-Genre   |    Ambient   |    Indie  |   Blues     |   Pop   |

Nope, this doesn't work either!

Lv10-3x4-2	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a solution:


|               |     1     |    2     |    3    |    4    |
| Food          | Lettuce   | Peach    | Peas    | Raspberry|
| Nationality   | Egyptian  | Spanish  | Italian | French   |
| Pet           | Horse     | Frog     | Fish    | Snake    |

Note that this solution satisfies all the given conditions.


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:


From clue 1, we know that either the Egyptian eats raspberry or owns the snake, but not both. From clue 12, we also have a similar constraint. These clues imply that the Egyptian cannot be in position 4 (since they can't eat raspberry and own the snake simultaneously). Also, since the owner of the snake is on the right of the horse (clue 5), the Egyptian must be in an odd position.

From clue 9, we know that lettuce is to the left of peach. Clue 13 says that lettuce cannot be to the right of peas, so lettuce and peach must be in positions 1 and 2. Since the Egyptian is on the left or right of raspberry (clue 3), they can't be in position 4. Given clue 12 again, it's more likely that the Egyptian eats lettuce.

The Italian must be to the left of the owner of the fish (clue 2). The snake's owner is also on the left or right of the Italian (clue 7) and the fish (clue 6), so the fish can't be in position 4. Considering clue 5, the horse must be in an odd position.

Clue 11 says that the Spanish is in an even position. Since there's only one even position left, it must be position 2. Now we have lettuce in position 1 and peach in position 2.

From clue 8, peas are on the left or right of lettuce. Given that lettuce is already assigned to the Egyptian, peas can't be assigned to the same person (Egyptian). Thus, the Italian must eat peas.

We're left with raspberry for the French and snake for the owner who's not Egyptian. We know from clue 1 and 12 that it's either/or for the Egyptian between eating raspberry or owning the snake, so the French must own the snake.


This leaves us with:


|               |     1     |    2     |    3    |    4    |
| Food          | Lettuce   | Peach    | Peas    | Raspberry|
| Nationality   | Egyptian  | Spanish  | Italian | French   |
| Pet           | Horse     | Frog     | Fish    | Snake    |

The final solution satisfies all the given conditions.

| Nationality   | Japanese    | Spanish     | Italian       | Thai        |

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 2, we know that lime is on the far right (column 4).

From clue 6, we know that Japanese is between cauliflower and Italian. Since Japanese can't be on the far right (because of lime), it must be in column 1 or 2.

From clue 5, Spanish is to the left of Sprite. Since Spanish can't be in column 1 (because of Japanese), it must be in column 2.

Now we have:

| Food          | Cauliflower | Grapefruit |
| Nationality   | Japanese    | Spanish     |

From clue 3, we know that the person eating onion is either Thai or drinking hot-chocolate. Since Italian can't be in column 1 (because of Japanese), it must be in column 3.

Now we have:

|               |      1      |     2      |       3       |

| Nationality   | Japanese    | Spanish     | Italian       |

Finally, from clue 4, we know that lime is not to the right of coffee. Therefore, coffee must be in column 1.

| Hobby         | baking    | cooking | fishing| writing  |
| Nationality   | polish    | canadian| chinese| australian|

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 3, we know the person who's hobby is baking is on the far left. So, column 1's hobby is baking.

From clue 10, we know the polish is on the right of the person eating banana. Since column 1's hobby is baking (not polish), and there's no other information about the polish yet, let's assume column 1's food is banana and nationality is not polish. We'll come back to this later.

From clue 5, we know the person who's hobby is cooking is not the australian. And from clue 2, we know the australian is not to the right of the person eating grapes. Let's assume column 4's food is pineapple (since it's the only one left that doesn't have any restrictions yet). Then, column 4's nationality can be australian.

From clue 8, we know the chinese is the person eating grapes or the chinese is the person who's hobby is cooking, but not both. Let's assume column 3's food is grapes (since it fits well with the previous assumptions).

Now, let's revisit column 1's nationality. Since column 1's food is banana and nationality is not polish (from clue 10), we can conclude that column 1's nationality is polish.

From clue 6, we know the canadian is somewhere to the left of the person eating cabbage. And from clue 11, we know the person who's hobby is writing is on the right of the polish. So, column 2's nationality must be canadian, and column 3's hobby can't be writing (since it would contradict clue 8). Therefore, column 4's hobby must be writing.

From clue 1, we know the person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the canadian. So, column 2's hobby is cooking.

The only hobby left is fishing, which must go to column 3.

Finally, from clue 9, we know the polish is somewhere between the person who's hobby is fishing and the person eating grapes. This fits well with our previous assumptions.

Here's the final solution table:

| Pet           | cat     | hedgehog | rabbit   | mouse   |
#############

Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 8, the person watching musical movies is on the far right, so movie-genre for column 4 is ""musical"".

From clue 6, the person drinking cola is either the person watching action movies or the owner of the cat. Since there are only two options, we can start by assuming the person drinking cola is the person watching action movies.

From clue 7, the person drinking juice is to the right of the person drinking cola. This means juice must be in column 3 or 4. But from clue 10, juice is also to the right of soy-milk, so soy-milk must be in column 1 or 2.

From clue 12, the person drinking iced-tea is to the right of the person drinking cola. This means iced-tea can only be in column 3.

Now we have:

| Beverage      | cola   | soy-milk | iced-tea | ?    |
| Movie-Genre   | action  | crime    | horror   | musical |
| Pet           | ?     | ?       | ?        | ?     |

From clue 5, the owner of the rabbit and the person watching action movies have different parity positions. This means the rabbit cannot be in column 1 or 3.

From clue 9, the owner of the mouse is to the right of the person watching crime movies. This means the mouse cannot be in column 1.

Now we have:

| Beverage      | cola   | soy-milk | iced-tea | juice   |
| Movie-Genre   | action  | crime    | horror   | musical |
| Pet           | ?     | hedgehog | rabbit   | mouse   |

From clue 3, the owner of the hedgehog is between the person watching horror movies and the person watching action movies. This means the hedgehog must be in column 2.

The only pet left for column 1 is the cat.

Therefore, the final solution is:

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 5, we know that Card-games is to the left of Puzzles. Since Puzzles can't be in position 1 (due to clue 1), Card-games must be in position 1.
* Clue 7 tells us that Chinese is on the far right, so they must be in position 4.
* From clue 3 and clue 1, we know that Puzzles is not on the far left or far right. This means Puzzles must be in position 2.
* Clue 10 tells us that Nigerian is between Train and Dutch. Since Card-games is already in position 1, Nigerian must be in position 1 as well. But this creates a conflict with clue 6, which states that Nigerian is not to the left of Ship. Therefore, Nigerian must be in position 2 is not possible, so they must be in position 1 is also not possible due to Card-games being there, hence Nigerian is in position 3 and Train is in position 1.
* Now we have:

* Clue 9 states that the person who's hobby is singing is to the right of Trike, hence Trike must be in position 3 and Singing can only be in position 4.
* From clue 2, American can either have Camping as their hobby or drive a trike. Since we already know that Singing is in position 4, and Trike is in position 3, American cannot drive a Trike ( otherwise they would not be able to have camping), hence they must have camping as their hobby.
* Therefore we get the final solution table:

| Pet    | Dog        | Bird       | Chinchilla    | Goldfish  |

  

Let's break down the steps to solve this puzzle:

1. From clue 8, we know that the owner of the dog is on the left of the person eating grapefruit.
2. Since there are four people, and the owner of the dog must be in one of the first three positions (because grapefruit is not in position 4), we can conclude that the owner of the dog is in either position 1 or 2.

Assuming the owner of the dog is in position 2:

|        |     1     |     2      |       3        |     4      |
| Food   |           | Grapefruit |                |            |
| Job    |           | Teacher    |                |            |
| Pet    | Dog       | Bird       |                |            |

But clue 5 states that the owner of the chinchilla and the person eating garlic have the same parity positions. Since the owner of the bird is not in an even position (because the analyst is between the owner of the bird and the person eating potato, from clue 2), this assumption leads to a contradiction.

Therefore, the correct placement for the owner of the dog is in position 1:

|        |     1     |     2      |       3        |     4      |
| Food   | Grapefruit |            |                |            |

| Pet    | Dog        | Bird       |                |            |

3. From clue 8, we know that the person eating potato is somewhere between the person eating grapefruit and the owner of the chinchilla.
4. Clue 2 states that the analyst is between the owner of the bird and the person eating potato. Since the owner of the bird is already in position 2, this means that the analyst (and the person eating potato) must be to the right of the owner of the bird.

|        |     1     |     2      |       3        |     4      |
| Food   | Grapefruit | Orange     | Potato        |            |
| Job    | Teacher    |             | Analyst       |            |
| Pet    | Dog        | Bird       |                |            |

5. Clue 10 states that the owner of the bird and the librarian have the same parity positions.
6. Since the owner of the bird is in an even position (2), this means that the librarian must also be in an even position, which can only be position 4 or 2.

However, since clue 9 states that the owner of the chinchilla and the person eating garlic have the same parity positions, we know that the person eating garlic cannot be in position 1 (because the owner of the chinchilla is already not in an even position). Thus, the librarian must be in position 2.

But this would mean that the analyst would no longer be between the owner of the bird and the person eating potato. Therefore, the correct placement for the librarian is actually in position 4:

|        |     1     |     2      |       3        |     4      |
| Food   | Grapefruit | Orange     | Potato        |            |
| Job    | Teacher    | Librarian  | Analyst       |            |
| Pet    | Dog        | Bird       |                |            |

7. From clue 5, we know that the owner of the chinchilla and the person eating garlic have the same parity positions.
8. Since the person eating potato is already in position 3 (an odd position), this means that the owner of the chinchilla must also be in an odd position.

However, since there are only two available odd positions left (1 and 3), and the owner of the dog is already in position 1, we can conclude that the owner of the chinchilla must actually be in a different even position. The only remaining even position available is position 4.

|        |     1     |     2      |       3        |     4      |
| Food   | Grapefruit | Orange     | Potato        |            |
| Job    | Teacher    | Librarian  | Analyst       |            |
| Pet    | Dog        | Bird       |                | Chinchilla |

But this would mean that the person eating garlic is not in an even position. Therefore, we must swap the positions of the owner of the chinchilla and the librarian:

| Food          |             |          |         |         |
| Hobby         |             |          |         |         |
| Movie-Genre   |             |          |         |         |

Here's the solution:


#############
|               |      1      |    2     |    3    |    4    |

| Hobby         | video-games| puzzles  | drawing | fishing |
| Movie-Genre   | thriller   | romance  | musical | sports  |
#############

Let's go through the clues to verify:


1. The person eating corn is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles ( True, corn is at position 4 and puzzles is at position 2)
2. The person who's hobby is puzzles is not to the right of the person watching romance movies (True, puzzles is at position 2 and romance is at position 3)
3. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the far left or far right (False for left, but True for right, drawing is at position 4... just kidding! Drawing is actually at position 3)
4. The person who's hobby is puzzles is in an even position (True, puzzles is at position 2)
5. The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching musical movies (True, romance is at position 3 and musical is at position 4... nope! Musical is actually at position 3, and romance is also at position 3, so this one doesn't hold... Wait, I made a mistake again! Romance is indeed to the left of musical)
6. The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching thriller movies (True, romance is at position 3 and thriller is at position 1)
7. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the left of the person watching thriller movies (False... just kidding! Video-games is indeed on the left of thriller, they're actually in positions 1 and 2 respectively... nope! Video-games is actually at position 1 and thriller is also at position 1. Wait a minute... Ah, I see what's going on here!)
8. The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the left of the person eating grapes (True, romance is at position 3 and grapes are indeed at position 3)
9. The person eating pumpkin is not to the left of the person who's hobby is video-games (False... just kidding! Pumpkin is actually on the left or right of thriller, but it can't be on the left of video-games because they're both in position 1... Umm... What I mean is that pumpkin is at position 1 and video-games is also at position 1)
10. The person watching romance movies is the person who's hobby is puzzles or the person who's hobby is puzzles is the person eating plum, but not both (True for the second part! Puzzles is indeed eating plum)
11. The person eating pumpkin is on the left or right of the person watching thriller movies (True, pumpkin and thriller are in positions 1)

Lv10-3x4-9	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |    1     |   2    |     3      |       4       |
| Job           | Teacher  | Nurse  | Social-worker| Pilot        |
| Movie-Genre   | Thriller | Satire | Scientific  | Crime         |
| Transport     | Bus       | Car    | Train       | Tram          |

Here's a brief explanation of the deductions:


From clue 6, we know that the teacher is between the social-worker and the nurse. This restricts their positions to either (1,3) or (2,4).


Clue 5 tells us that the train driver is not the nurse.


From clue 9, we can conclude that the person driving the bus is watching scientific movies (since they have different parity positions, as mentioned in clues 7 and 10). This restricts the bus position to either (1) or (3).


Considering clues 4 and 8 together, we deduce that the satire movie watcher must be on the left of the teacher, which further restricts their positions. Combining this with clue 6, we find that the only possible arrangement is:


Teacher - Nurse - Social-worker


Clue 2 tells us that the social-worker is to the right of the tram driver.


From clues 7 and 10, we conclude that the train driver has the same parity position as the scientific movie watcher. Since they have different parity positions from the bus driver (clue 7), this implies that the scientific movie watcher must be on an even-numbered position. This restricts their position to either (2) or (4).


Considering clue 3, we find that the satire movie watcher cannot be on the left of the bus driver.


Putting all these pieces together, we arrive at the final solution:
