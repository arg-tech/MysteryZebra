Here's a brief explanation of the solution process:

I started by using clues that provided direct information, such as clue 16 (the person eating corn is the person drinking juice) and clue 22 (the person drinking fanta and the person watching spy movies have the same parity positions).

Then, I used clues that provided constraints on the relative positions of different elements, such as clue 3 (the person eating blueberry is on the left or right of the person drinking juice) and clue 5 (the fan salsa is somewhere to the left of the person eating banana).

As I progressed through the clues, I was able to narrow down the possible arrangements and eventually arrived at a unique solution that satisfies all the constraints.

Note that some clues were used multiple times during the solution process, as they provided additional information or constraints on the relative positions of different elements."	{'beverage': ['hot-chocolate', 'juice', 'milk', 'water', 'fanta'], 'food': ['blueberry', 'banana', 'asparagus', 'corn', 'peach'], 'movie-genre': ['documentary', 'spy', 'scientific', 'adventure', 'thriller'], 'music-genre': ['country', 'salsa', 'techno', 'punk', 'jazz'], 'nationality': ['brazilian', 'italian', 'polish', 'british', 'argentine'], 'pet': ['lizard', 'frog', 'hamster', 'bird', 'snake']}	True	10	False

Explanation:

From clues 28 and 38, we can determine that the person drinking soy-milk is in position 2 and the fan of hip-hop is in position 3.

From clue 1, the person who's sport is climbing cannot be to the left of the fan of blues, so the fan of blues must be in either position 4 or 5. However, from clue 26, we know that the owner of the goat is not the fan of blues if the owner of the goat is also a fan of blues. Since the person watching mystery movies is drinking tea (clue 5), and the person drinking soy-milk is in position 2, the person watching mystery movies must be in position 3. Therefore, the fan of blues cannot be in position 3, so it must be in either position 4 or 5.

From clue 32, we know that the owner of the frog is between the owner of the mouse and the owner of the lizard, and from clue 33, we know that the owner of the fish is to the left of the owner of the lizard. Therefore, the order of pets must be: fish, mouse, frog, goat, lizard.

From clues 8 and 36, we can determine that the fan of soul is not the engineer and is in position 2 or 3. Since the person watching mystery movies (in position 3) cannot be to the left of the musician (clue 13), the fan of soul must be in position 2.

From clue 17, the fan of blues is not drinking coffee, so it must be either position 4 or 5. However, since the person watching mystery movies and the engineer have different parity positions (clues 12 and 37), we know that the engineer cannot be in position 3, which means that the fan of blues must be in position 5.

From clue 10, the owner of the fish is not playing cycling. Since the fan of techno is on the right of the person watching musical movies (clue 7), and the owner of the lizard is drinking iced-tea (clue 39), we know that the owner of the lizard must be in position 5.

From clue 19, the person who's sport is cycling and the fan of techno have different parity positions. Therefore, since the fan of techno cannot be in an even-numbered position, it must be in an odd-numbered position, which means that cycling must be in an even-numbered position (2 or 4).

From clue 14, we know that the person watching horror movies is not the dancer.

From clue 30, the owner of the fish is either watching horror movies or a fan of blues. However, since the fan of blues cannot watch mystery movies (clue 5), it must be the case that the owner of the fish watches horror movies.

Since the musician is drinking coffee (from clues 25 and 27), the person watching musical movies must be in position 4 (since the person who's sport is ice-hockey is to the right of the engineer, clue 23).

We can now fill in the rest of the table:

The fan of hip-hop is in the middle (position 3), so the entrepreneur and mirinda drinker are in positions 1 and 4 or positions 2 and 5. Since the person drinking soy-milk is not to the right of the fan of disco (clue 6), we know that the fan of disco must be in position 1.

The only possible arrangement for sports is: ice-hockey, rugby, cycling, volleyball, climbing.

Finally, since the owner of the lizard drinks iced-tea and watches spy movies (the only remaining option), we can fill in the final entries."	{'beverage': ['coffee', 'soy-milk', 'tea', 'mirinda', 'iced-tea'], 'job': ['musician', 'engineer', 'social-worker', 'entrepreneur', 'dancer'], 'movie-genre': ['horror', 'mystery', 'martial-arts', 'musical', 'spy'], 'music-genre': ['blues', 'soul', 'techno', 'disco', 'hip-hop'], 'pet': ['fish', 'frog', 'mouse', 'goat', 'lizard'], 'sport': ['ice-hockey', 'rugby', 'cycling', 'volleyball', 'climbing']}	True	7	False
