| Transport     | Quad-bike  | Motorbike | Scooter        | Boat      |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:


From clue 4, we know that basketball is to the left of soccer. From clue 11, paramedic is to the left of cycling, and from clue 14, paramedic is on the far left or far right. Combining these clues, we can deduce that paramedic (cycling) - basketball - soccer.

From clue 17, quad-bike is the owner of the frog, and from clue 10, quad-bike is rock music fan. So, frog (quad-bike) is on position 1 or 3. But from clue 5, cabbage is to the right of frog, so frog must be in an odd position.

From clue 6, fisherman is to the left of grapefruit, and from clue 15, boat is punk music fan. Combining these clues with clue 1 (boat on the far right), we can deduce that fisherman - grapefruit - boat (punk).

Now we have three groups: paramedic (cycling) - basketball - soccer, frog (quad-bike) - ?, and fisherman - grapefruit - boat (punk). We can fill in the gaps using clues 7 (quad-bike to the left of swimming), 9 (frog not cycling), and 13 (hedgehog not to the right of swimming).

The remaining clues helped me fill in the music-genre, pet, sport, and transport columns.

#############


Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

From clue 12, we know the Mexican is on the far left. Clue 10 tells us that the person who's hobby is traveling is also on the far left. Combining these two clues, we can determine that the Mexican is the traveler.

Clue 11 states that the owner of the cat is to the left of the person watching romance movies. Since the cat's owner is a social-worker (clue 20), we can place them in position 4. Clue 8 tells us that the person watching romance movies is not to the right of the Pakistani photographer, so they must be in position 1.

From clue 7, we know the American watches documentary movies, and from clue 3, we know this person has the same parity as the frog's owner. Since the American can't be in an even position (clue 4), they must be in position 3.

Clue 5 places the Mexican to the left of the nectarine eater, who is then in position 2. Clue 9 states that the person eating cabbage is on the right of the Pakistani, so they're in position 4.

The rest of the clues can be used to fill in the remaining gaps:

###########


Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning behind the solution:


From clue 3, we know the mechanic drives the jet-ski. Clue 14 places the mechanic next to the person driving the subway.


Clues 10 and 20 suggest that the person eating peach is between the person who's sport is lacrosse and the person driving the quad-bike.


Using clues 5 and 11, we can determine the positions of the people with hobbies traveling and drawing. Clue 9 restricts the position of the person with hobby drawing to be either next to the person drinking coffee or the person whose sport is skateboarding.


Clues 12 and 23 provide information about the software-developer's transport (quad-bike) and its relation to the photographer.


From clues 15, 22, and 26, we can establish the order of people eating kiwi, drinking coffee, and having sports rowing and basketball.


Using clue 25, we know the person with hobby traveling is to the left of the person drinking water. Clue 2 restricts the position of the mechanic relative to this person.


The remaining clues help us fill in the gaps and resolve any conflicts.

| Transport     | train      | car          | boat       | trike      |

Note that the person drinking tea is not explicitly mentioned in the solution, but it can be inferred from clue 2 and clue 15. The person drinking tea must be in position 3 or 4, since they are to the right of the person drinking lemonade (position 1) and to the left of the person driving the trike (position 4). However, since the fan classical is not to the left of the person drinking tea (clue 10), and the person who's hobby is drawing is a fan of classical or watching drama movies (clue 6), the only possibility is that the person drinking tea is in position 3.

Similarly, the beverages can be inferred from clues 2, 15, and other related clues. The person drinking lemonade is to the left of the person drinking tea, so they must be in position 1 or 2. Since the person drinking soy-milk is not mentioned explicitly, it can be assumed that they are in position 2. The person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the person watching satire movies (clue 8), which puts them in position 4.

The rest of the solution follows from a careful analysis of the remaining clues.
