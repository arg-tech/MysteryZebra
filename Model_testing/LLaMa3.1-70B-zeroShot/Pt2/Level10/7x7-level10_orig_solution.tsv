Note: The table represents the final solution, where each person is assigned a position (Pos), and their corresponding attributes are filled in. 

Here's a brief explanation of how the solution was derived:

* From clue 42, we know the photographer is on the far left.
* Clue 62 tells us the architect is to the left of the person watching animation movies.
* The paramedic and the owner of the guinea-pig are placed based on clues 48 and 58.
* Clues 44 and 61 help place the person who's sport is golf and the fan rock.
* The musician and the person who's sport is handball have the same parity positions, as per clue 41.
* Clue 67 places the paramedic to the right of the person driving the boat.
* Clues 70 and 71 help place the person who's hobby is reading and the person watching superhero movies.
* The owner of the cat is placed based on clues 76 and 79.
* Clue 80 places the security-guard to the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding.

By carefully considering all the clues, we can construct the final solution table."

| 1 | Water-polo | Kiwi | Lizard |
| 2 | Sailing | Broccoli | Hamster |
| 3 | Skiing | Iced-tea | Chinchilla |

#############

Note:

* The person who's hobby is fishing is not mentioned in the solution, as there was no information about fishing in the original puzzle.
* Some of the positions were not explicitly stated in the original puzzle, but were deduced through logical reasoning.

Here are some explanations for the deductions made:


* From statement 69, we know that Water-polo is in an odd position. Since it's not possible for Water-polo to be in position 9 (as there is no information about it being at the end), it must be in position 1 or 3. But from statement 47, we know that Water-polo is not the owner of the lizard, so it can't be in position 3. Therefore, Water-polo must be in position 1.
* From statements 31 and 56, we know that Sailing is on the left of Skiing and Golf is on the right of Sailing. This means Sailing must be in an odd position (either 1 or 5). But since Water-polo is already in position 1, Sailing must be in position 5.
* From statement 60, we know that Skiing is watching Martial-arts movies. Since there is no information about Martial-arts movies being at the end, it's likely that Skiing is in a position close to the middle (either 3 or 7). But since Sailing is already in position 5, and Golf must be on the right of Sailing (from statement 56), Skiing must be in position 3.
* From statement 67, we know that Rugby is watching Western movies. Since there is no information about Western movies being at the end, it's likely that Rugby is in a position close to the middle (either 4 or 6). But since Golf must be on the right of Sailing (from statement 56), and Skiing is already in position 3, Rugby must be in position 6.
* From statements 35 and 41, we know that Superhero movies are between Rat and Hiking. This means that Hiking must be in an even position (either 4 or 8). But since Rugby is already in position 6, and Golf must be on the right of Sailing (from statement 56), Hiking must be in position 8.
* From statements 28 and 72, we know that Photography and Hiking have different parity positions. This means that Photography must be in an odd position (either 1 or 9). But since Water-polo is already in position 1, Photography must be in position 9.
