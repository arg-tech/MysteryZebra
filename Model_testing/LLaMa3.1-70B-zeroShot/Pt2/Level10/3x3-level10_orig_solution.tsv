Lv10-3x3-1	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with the following solution:


#############
|         |       1        |     2      |     3      |
| Job     | Police-officer | Manager   | Dressmaker|
| Pet     | Guinea-pig     | Chinchilla| Fish      |
| Sport   | Lacrosse       | Golf      | Ice-hockey|
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 1, we know the manager is in the middle (column 2).
* Clue 3 tells us that the person who likes ice-hockey is between the dressmaker and the person who likes lacrosse. Since the manager is already in column 2, this means the dressmaker must be in column 3, and the person who likes lacrosse must be in column 1.
* From clue 5, we know the dressmaker doesn't like ice-hockey, so they must be associated with either golf or lacrosse. Clue 6 says that if the manager likes golf, then the owner of the fish is not the manager (but it's possible for the manager to like golf and someone else to own the fish). Since we already have a person in column 1 who likes lacrosse, this means the dressmaker must be associated with golf. This also means that the person who likes ice-hockey must be associated with either the police-officer or the owner of the chinchilla.
* Clue 2 tells us that the guinea-pig's owner doesn't like ice-hockey, so they must be in column 1 (police-officer) or column 3 (dressmaker). But we already know the dressmaker is associated with golf, so this means the police-officer must own the guinea-pig.
* Clue 4 tells us that the owner of the fish is not to the left of the manager. Since the manager is in column 2, and the dressmaker (who might be associated with fish) is already in column 3, this clue doesn't add any new information.

Putting it all together, we get the solution above!"

Let me re-analyze the clues...


Ah-ha!


Here's the correct solution:

Here's how the clues match the solution:


1. The person driving the airplane is somewhere between the Malaysian and the Russian.
	* Airplane is in column 2, between Russian (column 1) and Malaysian (column 3).
2. The Malaysian is the person eating garlic or the Malaysian is the person driving the motorbike, but not both.
	* Malaysian is in column 2, eating garlic.
3. The Russian is somewhere to the left of the Malaysian.
	* Russian is in column 1, to the left of Malaysian (column 2).
4. The person driving the airplane is somewhere between the person eating garlic and the person eating strawberry.
	* Airplane is in column 2, between garlic (column 2) and strawberry (column 3).
5. The Nigerian is on the left of the person eating garlic.
	* This clue is tricky! Nigerian is actually in column 3, but this doesn't match the other clues. Wait...
	* Ah-ha! I re-read the clues, and I realized that I made a mistake earlier. Nigerian should be on the left of garlic, which means Nigerian should be in column 1 or 2.
6. The Russian and the person driving the motorbike have the same parity positions.
	* Russian is in column 1 (odd), and motorbike is also in column 1 (odd).

Lv10-3x3-3	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |     1     |     2     |     3     |
| Beverage      | Fanta     | Soy-milk  | Juice     |
| Job           | Nurse     | Bartender | Librarian |
| Movie-Genre   | Animation | Comedy    | Spy       |

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 7, we know that the person watching animation movies and the bartender have different parity positions. This means that if the person watching animation movies is in an odd position (1 or 3), the bartender must be in an even position (2).

Clue 5 tells us that the person watching animation movies is not the bartender.

From clue 4, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the bartender. This means that soy-milk cannot be in position 3, so it must be in either position 1 or 2.

Clue 1 tells us that the librarian is the person drinking juice or the librarian is the person watching animation movies, but not both. Since the person watching animation movies is not the bartender (clue 5), and soy-milk is on the left of the bartender (clue 4), we can conclude that the librarian must be in position 3.

Now, let's consider clue 2: the person watching comedy movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching animation movies. This means that the person watching animation movies cannot be in position 3, so they must be in either position 1 or 2.

Clue 7 tells us that the bartender and the person watching animation movies have different parity positions. If the person watching animation movies is in position 1 (an odd position), then the bartender must be in an even position, which means the bartender cannot be in position 3 (since soy-milk would be on their left). Therefore, the bartender must be in position 2.

From clue 4, we know that soy-milk is on the left of the bartender. This means that soy-milk must be in position 1.

Clue 6 tells us that the person watching spy movies is not the librarian. Since the librarian is in position 3, and the person watching animation movies is in position 1, we can conclude that the person watching comedy movies must be in position 2 (since they are to the right of the person watching animation movies).

Finally, clue 3 tells us that the person watching spy movies is on the right of the nurse. This means that the person watching spy movies cannot be in position 1 or 2, so they must be in position 3.

Putting it all together, we get:

Lv10-3x3-4	"Based on the given clues, I will solve the puzzle step by step.


From clue 2, we know that the freelancer is to the left of the nurse.

|               |     1      |    2    |     3     |
| Job           | Freelancer | Nurse   | Teacher   |

| Nationality   |            |         |           |

From clue 4, we know that the Argentine and the fan of R&B have different parity positions. Since the Argentine can only be in position 1 or 3 (due to clue 3), the fan of R&B must be in the remaining position with a different parity.

|               |     1      |    2    |     3     |
| Job           | Freelancer | Nurse   | Teacher   |
| Music-Genre   |            |         | R&B       |
| Nationality   | Argentine  |         |           |

From clue 5, we know that the Colombian and the nurse have different parity positions. Since the nurse is in position 2 (an even number), the Colombian must be in an odd-numbered position.

|               |     1      |    2    |     3     |
| Job           | Freelancer | Nurse   | Teacher   |
| Music-Genre   |            |         | R&B       |
| Nationality   | Argentine  | Mexican | Colombian |

From clue 6, we know that the fan of R&B is to the left of the teacher. Since the R&B fan is already in position 3, this clue doesn't add any new information.

From clue 7 and clue 8, we can deduce that the freelancer must be the fan of salsa, as the freelancer and the salsa fan have the same parity positions, and the Argentine (in an odd-numbered position) cannot be both the Argentine and a salsa fan.


Here is the final solution:

Lv10-3x3-5	"After analyzing the puzzle, I've come up with a solution. Here is the completed table:


|               |      1      |    2     |     3      |
| Hobby         | woodworking | writing  | filmmaking |
| Nationality   | thai        | canadian | nigerian  |
| Transport     | airplane    | tram     | trike      |

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

* From statement 4, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is in an even position (2).
* Statement 2 tells us that either the Canadian is the person who's hobby is writing or the Canadian drives a tram. But since writing is already assigned to position 2, it must be the latter: the Canadian drives a tram.
* From statement 1, we know that the Canadian is in an odd position (not possible), so this must mean they're not in position 1. They must be in either position 2 or 3, but since writing is already assigned to position 2, it must be position 3. However, statement 5 tells us that the person driving a trike is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing, so the Canadian cannot be in position 3.
* Statement 5 also implies that the person driving a tram (Canadian) must be in position 2, and the person driving a trike must be in position 3. This means that the person with a woodworking hobby is in position 1.
* From statement 3, we know that the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the Nigerian. Since the Canadian (tram) is already assigned to position 2, it must mean that the Nigerian is in either position 1 or none at all (the latter is not possible since there are only three positions). This means that the Nigerian cannot be in position 1, so they must be in position 3, and filmmaking hobbyist must be on their right. But wait, we already assigned trike to position 3! So this statement actually tells us that the person with a woodworking hobby (position 1) is not the Nigerian.
* Statement 2 also tells us that either the Canadian or the writing hobbyist could have been the other option for the ""Canadian or writing"" condition. Since we already established that the Canadian drives a tram, it means that the Canadian cannot be in position 1 (since they're driving a tram and are not the writing hobbyist).
* The only remaining nationality is Thai, which must belong to the person with a woodworking hobby (position 1). This makes sense since statement 4 tells us that the writing hobbyist is in an even position (2), and we've already assigned Canadian to position 2.

Putting all these pieces together gives us the final solution:


|               |      1      |    2     |     3      |
| Hobby         | woodworking | writing  | filmmaking |

Lv10-3x3-6	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a solution:


#############

|            |    1     |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage   | Juice    | Fanta       | Tea        |
| Food       | Grapes   | Zucchini    | Pomegranate|
| Sport      | Golf     | Rowing      | Ice-Hockey |

#############

Let me walk you through the reasoning:


From clue 5, we know the person eating grapes is not to the left of the person drinking fanta. This means the person eating grapes must be on the right side (column 3 or 1). From clue 8, we know the person eating grapes is on the right of the person who's sport is golf. Therefore, the person eating grapes must be in column 1, and the person playing golf must be in column 2.


From clue 1, we know the person eating zucchini is to the left of the person drinking fanta. This means the person eating zucchini must be in column 1 or 2. Since the person eating grapes is already in column 1, the person eating zucchini must be in column 2.


Now, from clue 6, we know the person who's sport is ice-hockey is either the person eating pomegranate or the person drinking fanta (but not both). However, since the person eating zucchini is already in column 2, and the person drinking fanta must be to the right of the person eating zucchini (clue 1), the person drinking fanta cannot be in column 2. Therefore, the person who's sport is ice-hockey must be the person eating pomegranate.


From clue 3, we know the person playing ice-hockey is to the right of the person eating pomegranate. However, since the person eating pomegranate is already playing ice-hockey (from clue 6), this means the person playing ice-hockey must be in column 3.


Now, let's look at the beverage preferences. From clue 4, we know the person drinking juice is not to the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since the person playing ice-hockey is in column 3, the person drinking juice cannot be in column 2 (because it would be to the left). Therefore, the person drinking juice must be in column 1.


The remaining beverage preference can only be fanta or tea. From clue 1, we know the person eating zucchini is to the left of the person drinking fanta. Since the person eating zucchini is in column 2, the person drinking fanta must be in column 3 (which is already occupied by the person eating pomegranate). Therefore, the person in column 2 must drink tea, and the person in column 1 must drink juice.


The only sport left is rowing, which must go to the person in column 2.

Lv10-3x3-7	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a solution that satisfies all conditions:


|               |   1    |     2      |   3    |
| Movie-Genre   | Crime  | Family     | Sports |
| Music-Genre   | Trance | D&B        | Funk   |
| Pet           | Cat    | Chinchilla | Pony   |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 1, we know the person watching family movies owns a chinchilla. From clue 2, the pony owner is to the right of the chinchilla owner.


Clue 3 states that the funk fan watches sports movies. Clue 4 implies that either the family movie watcher likes trance or owns a chinchilla (but not both). Since we already know the family movie watcher owns a chinchilla, this person must like another music genre. The only option left is D&B, but that's already assigned to someone else in clue 6.


Clue 5 places the funk fan to the left of the family movie watcher, so funk can't be in column 2 or 3 (because sports movies are watched by the funk fan). This means crime movies must be watched by someone who likes trance music (column 1).


Now we have:


|               |   1    |     2      |   3    |
| Movie-Genre   | Crime  | Family     | Sports |
| Music-Genre   | Trance | ?          | Funk   |
| Pet           | ?     | Chinchilla | Pony   |

Since the person watching family movies doesn't like trance (clue 4), they must like D&B. Clue 6 states that the D&B fan is not to the right of the pony owner, so this means the D&B fan is in column 2.


The only pet left for the first column is a cat.


Therefore, the final solution is:


|               |   1    |     2      |   3    |
| Movie-Genre   | Crime  | Family     | Sports |
| Music-Genre   | Trance | D&B        | Funk   |

| Sport         | Lacrosse  | Climbing   | Basketball |


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 4, we know the person who's sport is climbing is to the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. This means Skydiving must be in position 1.
* Clue 3 states that the person who's hobby is skydiving and the fan funk have the same parity positions. Since Skydiving is in an odd-numbered position (1), Funk must also be in an odd-numbered position, which is position 1.
* From clue 6, we know the person who's hobby is writing is between the fan funk and the fan d&b. This means Writing must be in position 2.
* Clue 5 states that the person who's sport is lacrosse is not to the right of the fan d&b. Since Lacrosse can't be in position 3 (because it would be to the right of D&B), it must be in position 1, which is already occupied by Skydiving and Funk. Therefore, Lacrosse must be in position 2 or 3. However, since Writing is in position 2, Lacrosse must be in position 1, but this conflicts with our previous conclusion that Skydiving and Funk are in position 1. Therefore, Lacrosse must actually be in position 1 (which we previously concluded) or position 3 (but not to the right of D&B). Since it can't be in position 2 (occupied by Writing), Lacrosse must be in position 1.
* However, this conflicts with our previous conclusion that Skydiving and Funk are in position 1. Therefore, we need to revisit clue 4, which states that the person who's sport is climbing is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. This means Climbing can't be in position 1 (because it would be to the left of Skydiving). Therefore, Climbing must be in position 2 or 3.
* From clue 6, we know Writing is between Funk and D&B. Since Writing is in position 2, this means Funk must be in position 1 and D&B must be in position 3.
* Clue 5 states that Lacrosse is not to the right of D&B. This means Lacrosse can't be in position 3 (because it would be to the right of D&B). Therefore, Lacrosse must be in position 1 or 2. However, since Skydiving and Funk are already in these positions (or so we thought), this is a problem.
* Re-examining our conclusions, we realize that we made an assumption about the order of Skydiving and Funk. While clue 3 states they have the same parity position, it doesn't specify which one comes first. Therefore, let's try placing Funk in position 1 and see if it works out.
* With Funk in position 1, Writing must be in position 2 (because it's between Funk and D&B). This leaves Skydiving for position 3 (which has the same parity as position 1).
* Clue 4 states that Climbing is on the right of Skydiving. However, this can't happen if Skydiving is in position 3. Therefore, we need to swap Climbing and Basketball.
* This solution satisfies all the clues.

Here's how the clues fit into this solution:


1. The fan of house music is on the right of the person watching drama movies, which means the person watching drama (Italian) is in column 2, and the fan of house is in column 3.

2. The person watching disaster movies is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies. Since the Italian is watching drama, this means the person watching disaster must be either the Nigerian (column 1) or the Canadian (which would be in column 3). However, since clue 4 says the Italian is to the right of the person watching drama, it's more likely that the person watching disaster is in column 1.

3. The fan punk is not to the right of the Italian. This means the fan punk must be either in column 2 (but that would mean the Italian is also the fan punk, which is not allowed) or in column 1. Since the Nigerian is already in column 1 watching disaster movies, this means the Nigerian must be the fan punk.

4. The Italian is somewhere to the right of the person watching drama movies. This means the Italian can't be in column 1 and must be either in column 2 or 3. However, since clue 6 says the Italian is either the one watching drama or the fan house (but not both), this means the Italian must be watching drama.

5. The Italian is somewhere between the Nigerian and the fan blues. This means the fan blues can't be in column 1 (since that would mean the Italian is to the left of the Nigerian) and must be in either column 2 or 3. However, since clue 4 says the Italian is already watching drama, this means the fan blues must be in column 1.

6. The Italian is the person watching drama movies or the fan house (but not both). We've already established that the Italian watches drama.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 3, we know that the person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku. This means that column 1 must be either ""fantasy"" and ""sudoku"", or just ""fantasy"".

From clue 4, we know that the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. This means that column 2 must be either ""skydiving"" and ""musical"", or just ""skydiving"". We can also conclude that column 1 has ""sudoku"".

From clue 5, we know that the person watching musical movies is not to the left of the designer. Since column 1 already has ""fantasy"" (from clue 3), this means that column 2 must have ""musical"", and the project-manager (who can't be on both columns) must be in column 3.

Now, from clue 1, we know that the designer is not the person who's hobby is video-games. This means that column 1 has the designer.

From clue 2, we know that the project-manager is either the person who's hobby is skydiving or the person watching musical movies, but not both. Since column 3 already has ""horror"", this means that column 3 must be the dressmaker (since it can't be the designer).
