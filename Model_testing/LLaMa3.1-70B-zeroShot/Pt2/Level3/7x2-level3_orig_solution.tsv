Lv3-7x2-1	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


|               |     1      |       2       |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate | tea         |
| Food          | raspberry    | pineapple   |
| Hobby         | reading      | chess        |
| Job           | social-worker | analyst     |
| Nationality   | brazilian    | malaysian    |
| Pet           | chinchilla    | horse        |
| Sport         | volleyball    | golf         |


Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 6, we know the social-worker eats pineapple, so column 2 must be the one with pineapple.

From clue 5, we know the person who likes volleyball is also the one who likes reading. Since reading comes before chess (clue 3), column 1 must have reading and volleyball.

Clue 4 tells us that the person eating raspberry is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since pineapple is already assigned to column 2, raspberry must be in column 1, and hot-chocolate must be in column 2 (because it can't be on the same side as raspberry).

Clue 2 tells us that the owner of the horse is on the left of the Malaysian. Since column 2 has the person eating pineapple (and therefore cannot have the horse), the horse must be in column 1, and the Malaysian must be in column 2.

Now we know the Brazilian must be in column 1 (because there's only one nationality left).

The only pet left is the chinchilla, which must be in column 2 (because it can't be on the same side as the horse, according to clue 1).

Finally, we have tea and golf left for column 2.

Please note that this solution assumes that each person has a unique combination of characteristics. If there are any duplicate combinations, the puzzle may not have a unique solution.

Here's how I deduced the solution:

1. From clue 3, we know the person driving the van is on the left of the person watching horror movies.
2. Since the van driver can't be in column 2 (because they're to the left of someone), column 1 must have the van and column 2 must have the snowmobile.
3. From clue 2, we know the fan of folk music is on the left of the social-worker. This means the person who likes folk music must be in column 1, and their job is not social-worker (since they're to the left). Therefore, column 1 has a social-worker as their job.
4. Now we can fill in the hobbies: dancing goes with the Pakistani person (clue 1), and writing goes with the Russian person.
5. From clue 4, the owner of the goat is on either side of the dancer (Pakistani). Since column 2 has a snowmobile, which might not be suitable for a goat, we'll put the goat in column 1.
6. Finally, fill in the remaining blanks: column 2 must have horror movies and trance music to match the Russian person.

| Transport     | taxi          | scooter    |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 5, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey.

Clue 2 tells us that the person whose hobby is rock-climbing is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since rock-climbing can't be paired with ice-hockey, it must be paired with climbing.

From clue 4, we know that the person driving the scooter is on the left of the person eating lettuce.

Clue 3 tells us that the person driving the scooter is on the left or right of the argentine. Since the scooter driver can't be on the left (due to clue 4), they must be on the right of the argentine.

From clue 1, we know that the person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the dancer. The taxi driver can't be on the right (since the argentine and scooter are already paired), so they must be on the left.

Now, let's fill in the remaining gaps:

* The teacher can't be with ice-hockey (since soy-milk is on the right), so they're paired with climbing.
* Pomegranate and hot-chocolate go together, as do lettuce and soy-milk.
* Egyptian goes with taxi, and argentine goes with scooter.

The resulting table shows the correct pairings for each person."
Lv3-7x2-4	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a possible solution:


|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk   | Juice       |

| Sport         | Cycling       | Water-polo   |
| Transport     | Trike         | Tram         |

Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 1, the person drinking almond-milk is on the far left. From clue 5, the person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the person eating strawberry. Since there are only two types of food, and strawberry can't be paired with almond-milk (clue 1), it must be that strawberry is in column 2.

From clue 3, the owner of the goldfish is on the right of the fan of salsa. This means salsa can't be paired with almond-milk (column 1), so salsa must be in column 2. Jazz must then be in column 1.

Clue 4 states that the person driving the trike is on the left or right of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since there are only two types of transport, and tram can't be paired with almond-milk (clue 1), it must be that trike is in column 1.

Now we have:


|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk   | ?          |

| Sport         | Cycling       | Water-polo   |
| Transport     | Trike         | Tram         |

From clue 2, the person driving the tram is on the right of the person driving the trike. This means the person in column 1 must have a hobby other than card-games (since they can't be to the left of someone who eats strawberry). So rock-climbing must be in column 1.

Now we have:


|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk   | ?          |
| Food          | Strawberry    | ?          |
| Hobby         | Rock-climbing | Card-games  |
| Music-Genre   | Jazz          | Salsa       |
| Pet           | ?             | Goldfish     |
| Sport         | Cycling       | Water-polo   |
| Transport     | Trike         | Tram         |

Finally, since the only remaining beverage is juice, and it must be paired with apricot (the other food), we can fill in the last column:


#############
|               |       1       |     2      |

| Sport         | jet-ski/soccer | tennis  |
| Transport     | jet-ski    | subway   |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:


From clue 3, we know the person drinking soy-milk is driving the subway. This means that column 2 has soy-milk and subway.


Clue 5 tells us that the person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since column 1 can't have the jet-ski (because it would be to the right of the person with cooking), we conclude that column 2 has cooking as a hobby, and therefore, column 1 must have traveling.


Clue 4 tells us that the person eating peas has traveling as their hobby. Therefore, column 1 must have apricot, and column 2 must have peas.


Now, let's look at the pets. Clues 3 and 6 tell us that the owner of the rabbit is either on the far left or right and is next to the person who watches thriller movies. Since column 1 can't be next to column 2 (because it would be on the opposite side), we conclude that the owner of the pony must be in column 1, and the owner of the rabbit must be in column 2.


Clue 2 tells us that the person watching thriller movies is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer. This means that the person watching drama movies (column 1) must have a sport other than soccer or tennis (because it would conflict with clue 6). The only remaining option is jet-ski/soccer, but since the transport for column 1 is jet-ski, we conclude that column 1 has soccer and jet-ski.


Column 2 can't have drama movies, so it must have thriller. Column 2 also can't have soccer (because of clue 2), so it must have tennis.

| Sport         | rugby        | handball    |
| Transport     | skateboard   | helicopter  |


Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

From clue 3, we know the Brazilian is drinking iced-tea.

From clue 5, we know the person driving the skateboard is on the left of the firefighter. Since the firefighter can't be in position 1 (because there's no one to their left), they must be in position 2. The person driving the skateboard must then be in position 1.

Clue 4 tells us that the person drinking cola is into handball. Clue 1 says the person watching sports movies is on the left of the person drinking cola. Since the person drinking cola can't be in position 1 (because there's no one to their right), they must be in position 2.

Clue 2 tells us that the fan of pop is on the left or right of the videographer. If the pop fan were in position 1, then the videographer would have to be in position 2, but this can't happen because the firefighter is already in position 2 (from clue 5). Therefore, the videographer must be in position 1.

The only remaining job for position 2 is firefighter. The person watching sports movies must be on the left of the person drinking cola (clue 1), so they must be in position 1. This leaves documentary movies for position 2.

The only remaining music genre for position 1 is indie, and the only remaining sport for position 1 is rugby.

Finally, the only remaining nationality for position 2 is Russian, and the only remaining transport mode for position 2 is helicopter.

#############


Here's how I solved it:

From clue 4, the person driving the skateboard is the security-guard.

Clue 5 tells us that the Pakistani drives a van. Combining this with clue 1, we know that the fan of techno (person 2) is on the left of the Pakistani (person 2). Therefore, person 2 must be in column 2.

From clue 3, we know that the person eating plum is next to the skateboard driver (security-guard). Since the security-guard is already assigned to column 1, the person eating plum must be in column 2. This also means that the avocado-eater is in column 1.

Using clues 2 and 3 together, we can conclude that the person watching western movies (column 1) is on the left of the rowing enthusiast (column 2). 

Finally, clue 1 tells us that the fan of techno is on the left of the Pakistani. Since the Pakistani is already assigned to column 2, this means that the techno-fan must be in column 2 as well.

Putting all these pieces together gives us the completed table:

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

From clue 2, we know that the person eating orange owns the cat. Since there are only two types of food and pets, this means that the person eating kale must own the dog.

Clue 4 tells us that the person driving the trike is on the left of the owner of the dog. Since the person eating kale owns the dog (from above), this means that the person eating kale cannot be in column 2. Therefore, the person eating orange must be in column 2.

From clue 1, we know that the owner of the dog is on the left or right of the person drinking juice. Since the person eating kale owns the dog and is not in column 2, this means that the person drinking juice must be in column 2. Therefore, the person drinking iced-tea must be in column 1.

Clue 6 tells us that the analyst is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since the person drinking iced-tea is in column 1, this means that the analyst must also be in column 1.

From clue 3, we know that the lawyer watches superhero movies. Clue 5 tells us that the person whose sport is surfing is on the left of the person whose sport is cricket. Since there are only two types of sports and movie genres, this means that the disaster movie fan must be in column 1.

| Transport     | quad-bike  | train        |

Here's how I deduced the solution:

* From clue 5, we know the fan of disco eats orange. So, the person eating orange must be on column 1.
* From clue 4, the librarian is on the left of the person eating papaya, which means the librarian must be in column 1 and the person eating papaya is in column 2.
* From clue 3, the person eating papaya is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the person eating papaya is in column 2, the person driving the quad-bike must be in either column 1 or 2. But since the librarian is already in column 1, the quad-bike driver cannot be there. So, the quad-bike driver must be in column 1 is not possible, hence it has to be the other way around (clue 3), and we put train on the right.
* From clue 2, the owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the person who's hobby is drawing. So, the owner of the hedgehog must be in column 2 and the person with the hobby of drawing is in column 1 is not possible, hence it has to be the other way around.
* From clue 1, the owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the person who's sport is biathlon. So, the owner of the chinchilla must be in column 1 and the person with the sport biathlon is in column 2 is not possible, hence it has to be the other way around.

Now we can fill in the remaining information:
* The fan of disco eats orange (clue 5), so the fan of hip-hop must eat papaya.
* The librarian is already assigned to column 1, and the person with the hobby of drawing is on the left. So, the photographer must be in column 2.

| Transport     | scooter     | jet-ski       |

Here's my reasoning:


From clue 2, the electrician is on the far right. From clue 3, the owner of the pony is the electrician, so the pony must be on the far right as well.


Clue 1 states that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the far right. This matches with the electrician and pony from clues 2 and 3.


Now, looking at clue 4, the person driving the scooter is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the electrician (and thus the rock-climbing hobby) is on the far right, the scooter must be on the left.


From clue 5, the person eating carrot is on the right of the fan of funk. This means that carrot cannot be on the left, so it must be on the right, which also matches with the electrician and rock-climbing hobby being on the far right.


Clue 6 states that the owner of the pony is on the far left or far right. We've already determined that the pony (and electrician) are on the far right.


The remaining items can be filled in based on the process of elimination:


The person on the left must have video-games as their hobby, since rock-climbing is already taken by the electrician on the far right.


Similarly, the person on the left must have cucumber as their food, since carrot is already taken by the electrician on the far right.


The librarian must be on the left, since the electrician is on the far right.


Golf and scooter can be assigned to the left side based on clue 4.


Funk and cat can be assigned to the left side, leaving gospel and climbing for the right side (electrician).
