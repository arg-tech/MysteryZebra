| Transport     | Bike        | Subway      | Train        |

#############


Let me explain the step-by-step solution:

From clue 6, we know that the person drinking Iced-Tea is on the far left. From clue 4, we know that the entrepreneur is on the far right.

From clue 2, we know that the fan of techno is the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since the entrepreneur is on the far right (clue 4), and the owner of the turtle is the entrepreneur (clue 12), the person with the hobby of woodworking must be on the far right as well.

From clue 3, we know that the person who's hobby is baking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since the person with the hobby of woodworking is on the far right, the person with the hobby of baking and filmmaking must be on the first two positions.

From clue 8, we know that the coach is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is baking. Since the person with the hobby of baking is on position 1, the coach must be on either position 1 (which is not possible since the person drinking Iced-Tea is on position 1) or position 2.

From clue 10, we know that the fan of pop is on the left or right of the owner of the cat. Since the person with the hobby of baking is on position 1, and the coach is on either position 1 or 2, the owner of the cat must be on position 2, and the fan of pop must be on position 3.

From clue 9, we know that the person drinking cola is the fan of pop. Therefore, the person drinking cola is on position 3.

From clue 5, we know that the person who's sport is sailing is the person driving the train. Since the person with the hobby of woodworking is on the far right (position 3), and the person drinking cola is also on position 3, the person who's sport is sailing must be on position 3.

From clue 7, we know that the person who's sport is sailing is between the person driving the bike and the person driving the subway. Since the person with the hobby of filmmaking is on position 2 (between positions 1 and 3), the person driving the subway must be on position 2.

From clue 11, we know that the person driving the subway is the photographer.

The rest of the clues can be used to fill in the remaining gaps."

From clue 9, we know that the software-developer is the fan of r&b.


From clue 3 and 1, we can deduce that the paramedic is on the left of both the owner of the frog and the fan of d&b. Also from clue 10, the owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the owner of the frog.


Combining these clues with clue 8, we get:


|               |     1      |    2     |         3          |

From clue 11, the person driving the skateboard is the person who's hobby is filmmaking.


From clue 4 and 7, we can deduce that the cola drinker is on the left of the software-developer, and the car driver is on the right of the lemonade drinker. Also from clue 5, the cola drinker is on the left of the boat driver.

Lv3-7x3-3	"I'll help you solve the puzzle.


After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############

|               |     1      |    2     |     3      |
| Hobby         | singing   | card-games| writing    |
| Movie-Genre   | fantasy   | scientific| musical    |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop   | folk       | country    |
| Nationality   | turkish   | egyptian  | chinese    |
| Pet           | hedgehog | pony       | hamster    |
| Sport         | ice-hockey| cycling    | biathlon   |
| Transport     | airplane  | quad-bike  | boat       |

#############

Here's how I arrived at the solution:


From clue 7, we know the chinese person is on position 3.
From clue 8, we know the fan of country music is also on position 3.


Clue 1 tells us that the person driving the boat (position 3) is to the left of the chinese (position 3), but this is not possible. Therefore, the person driving the boat must be on position 2 or 1. However, from clue 5, we know the quad-bike driver is to the right of the airplane driver. This means the airplane driver cannot be on position 3. Hence, the person driving the boat must be on position 1.


From clue 4, the chinese (position 3) is to the right of the person watching scientific movies (position 2).
Clue 10 tells us that the turkish person (position 1 or 2) is to the left of the person watching fantasy movies. However, from clue 9, we know the card-games enthusiast (position 2) is to the right of the fantasy movie fan (position 1). Therefore, the turkish person must be on position 1.


From clue 2, the owner of the pony (position 2) is to the left of the cycling enthusiast.
Clue 11 tells us that the folk music fan (position 3 or 2) is to the right of the cycling enthusiast. However, from clue 8, we know the country music fan is on position 3. Therefore, the folk music fan must be on position 2.


From clue 6, the owner of the hedgehog (position 1 or 2) is to the right of the ice-hockey enthusiast.
Clue 12 tells us that the singing hobbyist (position 1 or 3) is next to the hedgehog owner. However, from clue 9, we know the card-games enthusiast (position 2) is to the right of the fantasy movie fan (position 1). Therefore, the singing hobbyist must be on position 1.


Now that we have most of the positions filled in, we can use the remaining clues to fill in the gaps:


The only person left for position 3 is the chinese writing enthusiast who likes country music.
The biathlon enthusiast and the scientific movie fan must be on position 2.
The airplane driver must be on position 1 or 2. Since the quad-bike driver (position 2) is to the right of the airplane driver, the airplane driver must be on position 1.


That's it! I hope this solution is correct."

Lv3-7x3-5	"Here is the completed table:

| Beverage      | hot-chocolate | almond-milk | water         |

| Nationality   | dutch         | australian  | japanese      |
| Pet           | goat          | chinchilla  | cat           |
| Sport         | weightlifting | swimming    | ice-hockey    |

Note: The numbers in the table correspond to the column numbers. Here is a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 2, we know that hot-chocolate is on either side (far left or far right). From clue 6, we know it's not possible for both almond-milk and water to be next to each other (since there needs to be someone drinking hot-chocolate), so almond-milk must be between fishing and the owner of the cat.

From clue 4, dancer is in the middle. From clue 7, fisherman is on the left of the dancer, which places bartender on the right side. 

From clue 9, water is on the left of australian. Since there's only one spot available for hot-chocolate (clue 6), we can place it on the far left.

With fishing and chinchilla in column 2 (from clues 10 and 8), fantasy movie-genre must be either column 1 or 3, and since mystery is already taken by column 1, fantasy goes to column 3.

Column 3 has musical movies, which only leaves ice-hockey for the japanese in column 3. Swimming goes on the right of dutch (clue 5). Weightlifting takes the remaining sport spot.

Goat takes the remaining pet spot, as cat and chinchilla are already taken by columns 2 and 1 respectively.

| Transport     | boat       | tram        | quad-bike       |

 

 Let me walk you through the steps to solve this puzzle.

From clue 7, we know that the dancer is on either far left or far right. But from clue 9, we know hot-chocolate is on the far right. Therefore, the dancer must be on the far left (1).

 Clue 3 states lemon is on the far right, but we already placed hot-chocolate there due to clue 9. Let's move the lemon to position 2 for now and come back to it later.

 From clue 10, we know apple is eating a quad-bike. And from clue 4, apple is ice-hockey. So ice-hockey must be on either end of the sport column (1 or 3). Since handball is left of badminton (clue 1), let's place ice-hockey at position 2 for now and come back to it later.

 Clue 5 says hot-chocolate is next to coffee. But since hot-chocolate is on the far right, that means coffee must be in position 2. Now we have a conflict - lemon was placed there earlier but now coffee occupies it.

 Let's sort out position 1 first. We already know dancer (job) and magic-tricks (hobby) fit at this spot because of clues 7 and 5 respectively.

 Clue 6 says sports is between sudoku and milk, and clue 8 says software-developer is right of the person watching sports movies. Since ice-hockey was placed in position 2 earlier (due to clue 4), let's place it back at its correct spot.

 With hot-chocolate on the far right, coffee can now be correctly placed next to it as per clue 5. That leaves milk for the middle column (2).

 Clue 2 tells us tram is between disaster and magic-tricks. But since magic-tricks was already placed in position 1, we know the order of columns 1-3 is: magic-tricks, sudoku, board-games.

 Clues 1 and 8 tell us handball must be on the left and software-developer to the right. Now we can correctly place ice-hockey at column 2 (badminton would not fit due to clue 1), apple (food) in column 2, and quad-bike (transport) in column 2.

 Lastly, dressmaker fits into position 3 because it's the only job left.

 The final solution is:

|               |      1       |      2      |         3          |

| Beverage      | lemonade    | cola       | juice       |

| Sport         | biathlon    | lacrosse   | rugby       |
| Transport     | roller      | train      | helicopter  |

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

From clue 9, the designer is on the far left or far right. Since there are only three positions, this means the designer must be in position 1 or 3.

From clue 6, the person who's sport is biathlon is between the person watching documentary movies and the electrician. This means the electrician cannot be in position 1 (since biathlon would have to be on the far left). Therefore, the electrician must be in position 2.

From clue 3, the person eating lettuce is the electrician. From clue 5, the person eating cranberry is on the left or right of the electrician. Since the electrician is in position 2, this means the person eating cranberry must be in position 1.

From clue 7, the person who's sport is lacrosse is the person eating lettuce, which we already know is the electrician.

From clue 4, the person eating lettuce (electrician) is on the right of the person watching zombie movies. This means the person watching zombie movies must be in position 2, but since the electrician is already in position 2, this means the person watching zombie movies must be in a different position. The only possible position left for the person watching zombie movies is position 3.

From clue 10, the person eating grapes is the person drinking juice. From clue 11, the german is on the right of the person drinking juice. This means the person drinking juice (and eating grapes) must be in position 2 or 1.

However, we already know that the electrician (eating lettuce) is in position 2, and the person watching zombie movies is in a different position. Therefore, the person drinking juice (and eating grapes) must be in position 3.

From clue 8, the person driving the train is on the right of the dressmaker. This means the person driving the train cannot be in position 1 or 2. Therefore, the person driving the train must be in position 3, but since we already know that the person drinking juice (and eating grapes) is in position 3, this means the person driving the train must be in a different column. The only possible column left for the person driving the train is Transport.

From clue 2, the person driving the helicopter is the person who's sport is rugby. This means the person driving the helicopter cannot be in position 1 or 2 (since biathlon and lacrosse are already assigned to those positions). Therefore, the person driving the helicopter must be in position 3.

The remaining columns can be filled in accordingly.

Lv3-7x3-10	"Here's the step-by-step reasoning and the final solution:


First, we can start by applying some constraints directly to the table.


From clue 2, the engineer is on the far right (column 3).


|               |     1      |     2     |     3      |
| Hobby         |            |           |            |
| Job           |            |           | Engineer  |
| Movie-Genre   |            |           |            |
| Music-Genre   |            |           |            |
| Pet           |            |           |            |
| Sport         |            |           |            |
| Transport     |            |           |            |


From clue 1, the person whose hobby is filmmaking is on the far left.


|               |     1      |     2     |     3      |
| Hobby         | Filmmaking |           |            |
| Job           |            |           | Engineer  |
| Movie-Genre   |            |           |            |
| Music-Genre   |            |           |            |
| Pet           |            |           |            |
| Sport         |            |           |            |
| Transport     |            |           |            |


From clue 5, we can confirm that the person whose hobby is filmmaking is indeed on the far left (not far right).


From clue 9, the person watching epic movies is driving the bike.


Let's apply some more constraints and make connections between them:


From clue 3, the owner of the goldfish is to the right of the person whose hobby is drawing. Since the person whose hobby is filmmaking is on the far left, the person whose hobby is drawing must be in column 2. The owner of the goldfish cannot be in column 1 and must be either in column 2 or 3.


From clue 4, the person watching western movies is to the left or right of the owner of the horse.


From clue 11, the person watching epic movies (driving the bike) is to the left of the person watching western movies. Combining this with clue 4 and considering the possible positions for the goldfish owner, we can conclude that:


- The person driving the bike (watching epic movies) must be in column 1.
- The person watching western movies must be in column 2 or 3.


Considering the connections between these clues, let's apply more constraints:


From clue 7, the person whose sport is basketball is to the left of the bartender. This means the bartender cannot be in column 1.


Now we can try to make some educated guesses and combine them with other clues:


We already know that the owner of the goldfish is not in column 1. Let's assume the owner of the horse is in column 2 (this will help us satisfy more constraints). Combining this with clue 4, we get:


- The person watching western movies must be in column 3.


Now let's consider some other possibilities and constraints:


From clue 8, the person driving the subway is to the left of the person whose sport is cycling. This means the person whose sport is cycling cannot be in column 1.


Combining all these clues, we get:


|               |     1      |     2     |     3      |
| Hobby         | Filmmaking | Drawing  |            |
| Job           |            |           | Engineer  |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic       | Western   |            |
| Music-Genre   |            | Funk      |            |
| Pet           |            | Horse     | Goldfish   |
| Sport         | Cycling    | Basketball|            |
| Transport     | Bike       | Subway    | Snowmobile |


Now we need to fill in the remaining blanks:


From clue 10, the fan of funk is on the left or right of the owner of the horse. We can see that this condition is already satisfied.


From clue 6, the owner of the hamster is between the fan of reggae and the analyst. This gives us a strong hint for the remaining positions:


- The analyst must be in column 1 (to satisfy the constraint with the owner of the hamster).
- The fan of reggae must be in column 3.
- The owner of the hamster must be in column 2.


Now we can fill in the remaining blanks:


From clue 7, the person whose sport is basketball is to the left of the bartender. This means the bartender must be in column 3 (since the analyst is already in column 1).


Here's the final solution table:
