Lv3-5x4-2	"After solving the logic puzzle, I arrived at the following solution:


|               |    1    |      2      |     3     |    4     |
| Food          | carrot  | banana      | blueberry | garlic   |
| Movie-Genre   | horror  | documentary | spy        | romance  |
| Music-Genre   | techno   | funk         | house      | pop       |

| Sport         | surfing  | lacrosse     | sailing    | basketball|

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:


From clues 1 and 3, we know that person 1 eats carrot and prefers surfing.
From clue 2, we know that person 2 or 4 (since blueberry is not eaten by person 1) eats blueberry and owns a cat. Since person 5 cannot be on the far left, person 2 cannot eat blueberry. Hence, person 4 eats blueberry and owns a cat.
From clue 10, we know that person 1's sport (surfing) is on the left of documentary movies. Since person 1's movie genre cannot be horror (due to the placement of person 4), it must be horror.
From clue 7, we know that documentary movies are on the left of funk music. Hence, person 2 or 3 watches documentary movies and person 3 eats banana.
From clue 8, we know that funk music is on the left of garlic. Since person 2 does not eat blueberry (which is eaten by person 4), person 2 must be eating banana and listening to funk music.
From clue 5, we know that pop music is on the right of cat's owner (person 4). Hence, person 4 listens to pop music.
From clue 9, we know that hamster's owner is on the left of horror movies. Since person 2 does not own a cat and eats banana, person 3 must own a frog or lizard and watch documentary movies.
From clue 11, we know that basketball is on the left or right of surfing (person 1). However, since person 2's sport cannot be sailing or lacrosse (due to the placement of spy movies in clue 6), it must be basketball. Hence, person 2 plays basketball and owns a lizard.
From clue 4, we know that house music is between funk and lizard. Since person 3 eats banana, watches documentary movies, and owns either frog or lizard, person 3 must own a frog and listen to house music.

The final solution table is:

Lv3-5x4-3	"After analyzing the clues, I have arrived at a possible solution:


#############
|               |     1      |     2      |    3     |      4       |
| Food          | blueberry  | carrot     | mango    | garlic      |
| Movie-Genre   | crime      | martial-arts| zombie    | scientific  |
| Music-Genre   | d&b        | house      | electronic| metal       |
| Nationality   | chinese    | brazilian  | canadian  | dutch        |
| Pet           | cat        | hamster    | rabbit    | pony         |
#############

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

From clue 2, we know that the fan of d&b is on the far left. From clue 5, we can deduce that the person eating blueberry is also on one of the extreme positions.

From clue 1, the owner of the hamster must be in column 3 or 4, since it's to the right of the person eating carrot. Clue 14 tells us that the owner of the cat is to the right of the owner of the hamster, so they must occupy columns 2 and 3.

Now we know that the fan of house (clue 9) and the owner of the rabbit (clue 10) are in column 3 or 4. From clue 8, the person watching crime movies is on the left or right of the fan of d&b, which means it's either in column 1 or 2.

Considering clues 7 and 11 together, we can infer that the person eating garlic is in column 4 (next to electronic). We also know from clue 13 that the brazilian is on the left of the canadian, so they must occupy columns 3 and 4 (in either order).

Using clues 6 and 12, we conclude that the person watching zombie movies is on the right of the brazilian. From clue 4, the mango-eater is next to the blueberry-eater.

Finally, we arrange the remaining elements according to their respective constraints:

Lv3-5x4-4	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


 #############
|               |     1      |    2     |   3    |       4       |
| Beverage      |  hot-choc  |  milk    | juice  |      7up       |
| Food          |  asparagus | eggplant | plum   |      lime      |
| Movie-Genre   | family     | western  | horror | superhero     |
| Music-Genre   | jazz       | rock     | techno |      dubstep   |
| Nationality   | australian | canadian | dutch  | indonesian    |
 #############


Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 12, we know the Australian is on the far left (column 1).

Clue 3 tells us that hot-chocolate is on the far left or right. Since Australian is already on the far left, hot-chocolate must also be in column 1.

Clue 10 says family movies are on the left or right of hot-chocolate. Given the available spaces, family movies must be in column 1 as well.

From clue 8, we know that family movies are to the left of asparagus. This means asparagus is in column 2.

Clue 7 states that Australian (column 1) is on the left or right of Canadian. Since Australian is already on the far left, Canadian must be in column 2.

From clue 4, we know that milk is to the left of Dutch. Clue 13 tells us that rock music is paired with milk, so they both go together. Given the available spaces and the fact that Canadian is already in column 2, milk (and rock) must be in column 3. This means Dutch is in column 4.

Clue 5 states that plum is paired with juice, and clue 11 tells us that plum is to the left of dubstep. Dubstep is on the far right or left (clue 1), but since Australian is already on the far left, dubstep must be on the far right (column 4). Plum and juice are therefore in column 3.

Clue 9 says lime is to the right of western movies. Given the available spaces and the fact that plum is already in column 3, western movies and lime go together in columns 2 and 4, respectively.

The remaining movie genres (horror and superhero) must be paired with techno and jazz music, which are in columns 3 and 2, respectively. Clue 6 tells us that jazz is on the left or right of Indonesian, so they both go together in column 2.

Finally, horror movies are on the left or right of techno (clue 2), and since western movies are already in column 2, horror movies must be paired with techno in column 3. This means superhero movies are in column 1.

And that's it!"
Lv3-5x4-5	"Let's start solving the puzzle step by step.


From clue 12, the japanese can be either on the far left or far right. But from clue 2, we know that the fisherman (who is japanese) eats strawberry, and from clue 11, the person who eats pepper is also the one who likes basketball. Since the person eating pepper is on the far left (clue 4), and the mexican is not on the far left (because of clue 6), we can place the mexican (software-developer) in position 2 or 3.


We know from clue 1 that the software-developer is the mexican, so:


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |

| Sport         | basketball     |                    |             |            |

 
From clue 6, the mexican (in position 2) is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish. This means that the goldfish must be in either position 1 or 3.


From clue 5, the person eating cabbage is to the right of the chinese. Also, from clue 13, the person who likes cricket is between the strawberry-eater (japanese) and the cabbage-eater. Since the person eating pepper is on the far left, we know that:


* The japanese can't be on position 4 because there would not be enough space for the cricket lover.
* Therefore, the japanese must be in position 1.


From clue 12:


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |

From clue 10:

| Sport         | basketball     |                    |             |            |

 
From clue 13, the cricket lover must be in position 2 or 3. However, if the cricket lover is in position 2, then there would not be enough space for the chinese (because of clue 5). So:


The cricket lover must be in position 3.


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |

From clue 3, the person who likes basketball owns a cat:


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |

| Sport         | basketball     |                    | cricket     |            |

 
From clue 4:


The person eating pepper is on the far left. But this contradicts our current solution!


So we should move the pepper-eater to position 1:


This creates a new contradiction with clue 12!


However, from clue 12, the japanese can be either on the far left or far right.


We previously assumed that the japanese was in position 1, but now let's try placing them in position 4:


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |
| Food          | pepper         |                    |             |            |
| Job           |                | software-developer|             |            |
| Nationality   |                | mexican            |             | japanese   |

| Sport         | basketball     |                    |             |            |

 
From clue 13:


The cricket lover is between the strawberry-eater and the cabbage-eater.


Since the person eating pepper (basketball) is in position 1, we know that:


* The strawberry-eater must be either in position 2 or 3.
* However, if the strawberry-eater is in position 2, then there would not be enough space for the chinese and the cabbage-eater.
* Therefore, the strawberry-eater must be in position 4.


However, this contradicts our previous assumption that the japanese (who eats strawberry) is in position 4!


So let's try placing the person who eats strawberry in position 3:


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |

| Sport         | basketball     |                    |             |            |

 
From clue 10:


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |

| Sport         | basketball     |                    |             |            |

 
From clue 5:


The cabbage-eater must be to the right of the chinese.


Since the strawberry-eater is in position 3, we know that:


* The cricket lover must be either in position 2 or 4 (because they are between the strawberry-eater and the cabbage-eater).
* However, if the cricket lover is in position 2, then there would not be enough space for the chinese.
* Therefore, the cricket lover must be in position 4.


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |

| Sport         | basketball     |                    |             | cricket    |

 
From clue 2:


The person who eats avocado is not in position 1 (because they are between the fisherman and the cabbage-eater).


However, there is no avocado!


So we need to use the remaining food: cabbage.


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |

| Sport         | basketball     |                    |             | cricket    |

 
From clue 5:


The cabbage-eater must be to the right of the chinese.


Since the chinese is in position 1, we know that:


* The cabbage-eater must be either in position 2 or 3.
* However, if the cabbage-eater is in position 2, then there would not be enough space for the cricket lover (who is between the strawberry-eater and the cabbage-eater).
* Therefore, the cabbage-eater must be in position 4.


However, this contradicts our previous assumption that the cabbage-eater is in position 4!


So let's try placing the chinese in a different position:


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |
| Food          | pepper         |                    | strawberry  |            |
| Job           |                | software-developer| fisherman   | japanese   |
| Nationality   |                | mexican            | chinese     | japanese   |
| Pet           |                |                    | gold        |            |
| Sport         | basketball     |                    |             | cricket    |

 
From clue 13:


The cricket lover is between the strawberry-eater and the cabbage-eater.


Since the strawberry-eater is in position 3, we know that:


* The cricket lover must be either in position 2 or 4.
* However, if the cricket lover is in position 2, then there would not be enough space for the cabbage-eater (because they are to the right of the chinese).
* Therefore, the cricket lover must be in position 4.


However, this contradicts our previous assumption that the japanese is in position 4!


So let's try placing the japanese in a different position:


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |
| Food          | pepper         |                    | strawberry  |            |
| Job           |                | software-developer| fisherman   |            |
| Nationality   | chinese        | mexican            |             | japanese   |
| Pet           |                |                    | gold        |            |
| Sport         | basketball     |                    |             | cricket    |

 
From clue 5:


The cabbage-eater must be to the right of the chinese.


Since the chinese is in position 1, we know that:


* The cabbage-eater must be either in position 2 or 3.
* However, if the cabbage-eater is in position 2, then there would not be enough space for the cricket lover (who is between the strawberry-eater and the cabbage-eater).
* Therefore, the cabbage-eater must be in position 3.


However, this contradicts our previous assumption that the person who eats strawberry is in position 3!


So let's try placing them in a different order:


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |
| Food          | pepper         |                    |             |            |
| Job           |                | software-developer|             |            |
| Nationality   | chinese        | mexican            |             | japanese   |
| Pet           |                |                    | gold        |            |
| Sport         | basketball     |                    |             | cricket    |

 
From clue 10:


The person who eats strawberry is in position 3.


However, we previously assumed that the cabbage-eater was in position 3!


So let's try placing them in a different order:


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |
| Food          | pepper         |                    |             |            |
| Job           |                | software-developer| fisherman   | japanese   |
| Nationality   | chinese        | mexican            |             | japanese   |
| Pet           |                |                    | gold        |            |
| Sport         | basketball     |                    |             | cricket    |

 
From clue 13:


The cricket lover is between the strawberry-eater and the cabbage-eater.


Since we don't know who eats strawberry or cabbage, let's try to figure it out:


We have two people left: the fisherman and the japanese.


So one of them must eat strawberry, and the other must eat cabbage.


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |
| Food          | pepper         |                    |             |            |
| Job           |                | software-developer| fisherman   | japanese   |
| Nationality   | chinese        | mexican            |             | japanese   |
| Pet           |                |                    | gold        |            |
| Sport         | basketball     |                    |             | cricket    |

 
Let's say the fisherman eats strawberry.


Then, the japanese must eat cabbage.


However, this contradicts our previous assumption that the person who eats strawberry is in position 3!


So let's try placing them in a different order:


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |
| Food          | pepper         |                    |             |            |
| Job           |                | software-developer| fisherman   | japanese   |
| Nationality   | chinese        | mexican            |             | japanese   |
| Pet           |                |                    | gold        |            |
| Sport         | basketball     |                    |             | cricket    |

 
Let's say the fisherman eats cabbage.


Then, the japanese must eat strawberry.


This looks good!


So we have:


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |
| Food          | pepper         |                    |             |            |

| Sport         | basketball     |                    |             | cricket    |

 
From clue 13:


The cricket lover is between the strawberry-eater and the cabbage-eater.


Since we know who eats strawberry and cabbage, let's try to figure out where they are:


We have the fisherman (who eats cabbage) in position 3.


So the strawberry-eater must be either in position 2 or 4.


However, if the strawberry-eater is in position 2, then there would not be enough space for the cricket lover!


So the strawberry-eater must be in position 4.


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |

Let's say the strawberry-eater is in position 2.


Then, the cricket lover must be either in position 3 or 4.


However, if the cricket lover is in position 3, then there would not be enough space for the fisherman!


So the cricket lover must be in position 4.


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |

From clue 3:


The person who eats strawberry has a dog.


So the person who eats strawberry is not the japanese!


However, we already knew that!


Let's try to figure out what pet the chinese person has:


We have the mexican person with an unknown pet.


We also have the chinese person with an unknown pet.


Since the chinese person can't have a dog (because the person who eats strawberry has a dog), let's say the chinese person has a cat!


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |

| Sport         | basketball     |                    |             | cricket    |

 
From clue 4:


The person who has a bird lives next to the person who plays soccer.


Since we don't know what pet the mexican person has, let's say they have a bird!


Then, the person who plays soccer must be either in position 1 or 3.


However, if the person who plays soccer is in position 1, then there would not be enough space for the chinese person!


So the person who plays soccer must be in position 3.


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |

| Sport         | basketball     |                    | soccer      | cricket    |

 
From clue 5:


The person who plays tennis lives next to the person who has a goldfish.


Since we don't know what pet the fisherman is, let's say they have a goldfish!


Then, the person who plays tennis must be either in position 2 or 4.


However, if the person who plays tennis is in position 2, then there would not be enough space for the mexican person!


So the person who plays tennis must be in position 4.


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |
| Food          | pepper         | strawberry | cabbage    |            |
| Job           |                | software-developer| fisherman   | japanese   |
| Nationality   | chinese        | mexican            |             | japanese   |
| Pet           | cat            | dog              | goldfish   |            |
| Sport         | basketball     |                    | soccer      | tennis     |

 
Now we can start filling in the blanks!


Let's start with the person who eats pepper.


We know that this person is not the fisherman (because they eat cabbage), and not the japanese (because they eat strawberry).


So the person who eats pepper must be either the chinese person or the mexican person.


However, if the person who eats pepper is the mexican person, then there would not be enough space for the bird!


So the person who eats pepper must be the chinese person!


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |
| Food          | pepper         | strawberry | cabbage    |            |
| Job           |                | software-developer| fisherman   | japanese   |
| Nationality   | chinese        | mexican            |             | japanese   |
| Pet           | cat            | dog              | goldfish   |            |
| Sport         | basketball     |                    | soccer      | tennis     |

 
Next, let's try to figure out what job the chinese person has.


We know that this person is not a software developer (because they are in position 1), and not a fisherman (because they eat pepper).


So the chinese person must be either an engineer or a chef.


However, if the chinese person is an engineer, then there would not be enough space for the mexican person!


So the chinese person must be a chef!


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |
| Food          | pepper         | strawberry | cabbage    |            |
| Job           | chef           | software-developer| fisherman   | japanese   |
| Nationality   | chinese        | mexican            |             | japanese   |
| Pet           | cat            | dog              | goldfish   |            |
| Sport         | basketball     |                    | soccer      | tennis     |

 
Finally, let's try to figure out what sport the chinese person plays.


We know that this person is not a tennis player (because they are in position 1), and not a soccer player (because they are in position 1).


So the chinese person must be either a basketball player or a cricket player.


However, if the chinese person is a cricket player, then there would not be enough space for the mexican person!


So the chinese person must be a basketball player!


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |
| Food          | pepper         | strawberry | cabbage    |            |
| Job           | chef           | software-developer| fisherman   | japanese   |
| Nationality   | chinese        | mexican            |             | japanese   |
| Pet           | cat            | dog              | goldfish   |            |
| Sport         | basketball     |                    | soccer      | tennis     |

 
Now we have the solution!


The chinese person is a chef who eats pepper and plays basketball.


They have a cat as a pet.


The mexican person is a software developer who eats strawberry and has a dog as a pet.


The fisherman is an engineer who eats cabbage and has a goldfish as a pet.


They play soccer.


The japanese person is a tennis player who eats strawberry and has an unknown pet.


Note that there are some ambiguities in the solution.


For example, we don't know what sport the mexican person plays, or what pet the japanese person has.


However, this is because the puzzle doesn't provide enough information to determine these things uniquely."
Lv3-5x4-6	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############

|               |       1        |       2       |      3      |     4     |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk    | Sprite         | Hot-chocolate | Coffee    |

| Job           | Security-guard | Pilot           | Musician      | Scientist |
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific     | Drama           | Adventure     | Romance   |
| Sport         | Surfing        | Cycling         | Basketball    | Soccer    |

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 4, basketball is on the far left or right. Since surfing is also on the left or right of strawberry (clue 5), and strawberry is not on the far left or right (due to clue 3), basketball must be on the far right.
* Clue 7 states that sprite is on the left of hot-chocolate, which means coffee cannot be next to sprite. Therefore, almond-milk must be on the far left (clue 10).
* The pilot is on the left of cycling (clue 6), and the person eating papaya is cycling (clue 9). Since the scientist is on the far right (clue 12), the pilot cannot be next to the scientist. Therefore, the pilot must be in position 2.
* Clue 8 states that drama movies are on the right of hot-chocolate, which means scientific movies must be in position 1 (clue 8).
* The rest of the positions can be filled using the remaining clues.

Please note that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other solutions that satisfy all the conditions."

From clue 3, we know that salsa is paired with badminton. From clue 9, we can conclude that badminton is in position 2 or 3.


From clue 13, photography (and fanta) must be on either end. Clue 10 tells us that photography is the same person as fanta.


Clue 7 says dancing is to the left of soy-milk, so dancing can't be on the far right (since soy-milk would have no one to its right).


From clue 4 and clue 11, chess must be either position 2 or 3. Also, from clue 12, cricket is between salsa and chess.


Putting all these clues together, we get:


 Motorbike (chess) can't be in position 1 since it's on the far left or right, so photography (fanta) is in position 1.


From clue 2, rock must be to the left or right of jet-ski. From clue 5, biathlon is to the right of salsa. This places salsa in position 3.


With salsa in position 3 and badminton as its sport, we can fill in lacrosse for the remaining position (4) in sport column since it's not mentioned in any other clues related to sport.


Putting all these together gives us our solution:

Lv3-5x4-8	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a possible solution:


|             |      1       |     2     |    3     |     4      |
| Food        | raspberry   | pumpkin  | orange   | plum       |
| Job         | librarian   | manager  | engineer | photographer|
| Pet         | cat         | bird     | goat     | snake      |
| Sport       | badminton   | rugby    | handball | basketball  |
| Transport   | jet-ski     | quad-bike| airplane | van        |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* Clue 1 places the person eating raspberry on the left of the person driving the jet-ski (column 2).
* Clue 2 puts the manager on the left of the engineer, so they must be in columns 2 and 3.
* Clue 3 identifies the owner of the cat as the person who plays handball. Since the person eating orange is on the right of the owner of the cat (clue 7), the cat's owner must be in column 1 or 2. Badminton is also on the left of the owner of the cat (clue 9), so badminton must be in column 1.
* Clue 4 places the airplane driver between the quad-bike and bird owners, so they must be in columns 2-4.
* Clues 5 and 6 suggest that the engineer and librarian are near the owner of the bird. Since the manager is on the left of the engineer (clue 2), the librarian must be in column 1.
* Clue 8 puts rugby near the manager, so rugby must be in column 2 or 3. But badminton is already in column 1, and handball is with the cat owner in column 1 or 2, so rugby must be in column 3.
* Clues 10-12 help to fill in the remaining gaps.

Please note that there might be other possible solutions, but this one seems to satisfy all the given clues."
Lv3-5x4-9	"Here is the step-by-step solution to the logic puzzle:


From statement 5, we know that the person eating garlic is the person who's sport is weightlifting.


From statement 10, we know that the person watching documentary movies is also the person who's sport is weightlifting.


Therefore, the person eating garlic and the person watching documentary movies must be in columns 1 and 4 (since they share the same sport).


We can start filling in some information:


|               |       1       |    2     |    3    |      4       |
| Food          |  Garlic      |          |         |              |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary  |          |         |              |
| Music-Genre   |               |          |         |              |
| Pet           |               |          |         |              |
| Sport         | Weightlifting |          |         |              |


From statement 1, we know that the fan of techno is on the right of the owner of the pony.


From statement 4, we know that the owner of the pony is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing.


Therefore, the person who's sport is surfing must be in column 3 or 4 (since it is to the right of the owner of the pony).


However, since the person watching documentary movies is already in column 4, and they have weightlifting as their sport, the person who's sport is surfing must be in column 3.


We can fill in some more information:


|               |       1       |    2     |    3    |      4       |
| Food          |  Garlic      |          |         |              |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary  |          |         |              |
| Music-Genre   |               |          |         |              |
| Pet           |               |          |         |              |
| Sport         | Weightlifting |          | Surfing |              |


From statement 3, we know that the owner of the pony is between the person eating cherry and the owner of the hedgehog.


Since the person eating garlic (and watching documentary movies) is already in column 1, the owner of the pony must be in column 2, with the person eating cherry to their left and the owner of the hedgehog to their right.


We can fill in some more information:


|               |       1       |    2     |    3    |      4       |
| Food          | Cherry      | Pony     |         |              |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary  |          |         |              |
| Music-Genre   |               |          |         |              |
| Pet           | Hedgehog    | Pony     | Goat/Lizard |              |
| Sport         | Weightlifting |          | Surfing |              |


From statement 2, we know that the person watching crime movies is on the left of the person eating cherry.


Since the person eating cherry is in column 1, the person watching crime movies must be in column 1 as well (since there are no columns to the left).


However, this creates a conflict with our previous information - the person watching documentary movies was already in column 1!


This means that statement 2 cannot be used directly. Instead, we can use it to infer that the person eating cherry is not on the far right.


From statement 9, we know that the fan of d&b is indeed a fan of d&b (this statement provides no useful information).


From statement 11, we know that the owner of the goat is on the right of the owner of the lizard.


Since there are two remaining columns and three remaining pets (goat, hedgehog, lizard), we can use this information to deduce the correct order:


The owner of the hedgehog must be in column 2 or 3. If they were in column 4, then the owner of the goat would have to be on their right, but there is no space left!


However, since the owner of the pony is already in column 2, the owner of the hedgehog must be in column 3.


The owner of the lizard must be to the left of the owner of the goat. Since the owner of the hedgehog is in column 3, this means that the owner of the lizard must be in column 1 or 2.


However, since the person eating cherry (and watching crime movies) is already in column 1, and the owner of the pony is already in column 2, we can conclude that:


The owner of the goat is actually on the far right!


We can fill in some more information:

| Sport         | Weightlifting |          | Surfing |              |


From statement 6, we know that the person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies.


Since the person watching crime movies is in column 3, and the person watching documentary movies is in column 1, this means that:


The person watching drama movies must be in column 2!


We can fill in some more information:


|               |       1       |    2     |    3    |      4       |
| Food          | Cherry      | Pony     |         |              |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary  | Drama    | Crime    |              |
| Music-Genre   |               |          |         |              |
| Pet           | Hedgehog    | Pony     | Lizard   | Goat        |
| Sport         | Weightlifting |          | Surfing |              |


From statement 8, we know that the person eating orange is on the left or right of the person watching documentary movies.


Since the person watching documentary movies is in column 1, and there are no columns to the left:


The person eating orange must be in column 2!


However, since the owner of the pony (and the fan of drama) is already in column 2:


This creates a conflict!


We can resolve this by moving the person eating cherry (and watching crime movies) one column to the right.


Here is the updated table:


|               |       1       |    2     |    3    |      4       |
| Food          | Orange      | Cherry   |         |              |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary  | Drama    | Crime    |              |
| Music-Genre   |               |          |         |              |
| Pet           | Hedgehog    | Pony     | Lizard   | Goat        |
| Sport         | Weightlifting |          | Surfing |              |


From statement 7, we know that the fan of techno is on the left of the person who's sport is parkour.


Since there are two remaining sports (handball and parkour), we can conclude that:


The person who's sport is handball must be in column 2!


We can fill in some more information:


|               |       1       |    2     |    3    |      4       |
| Food          | Orange      | Cherry   |         |              |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary  | Drama    | Crime    |              |
| Music-Genre   | Techno      |          | Funk    |              |
| Pet           | Hedgehog    | Pony     | Lizard   | Goat        |
| Sport         | Weightlifting | Handball | Surfing |              |


From statement 13, we know that the fan of funk is indeed a fan of funk (this statement provides no useful information).


However, since there are two remaining music genres (funk and techno), we can conclude that:


The person who's music genre is unknown must be in column 3!


We can fill in some more information:


|               |       1       |    2     |    3    |      4       |
| Food          | Orange      | Cherry   | Peach    |              |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary  | Drama    | Crime    |              |
| Music-Genre   | Techno      | Funk     | Unknown  |              |
| Pet           | Hedgehog    | Pony     | Lizard   | Goat        |
| Sport         | Weightlifting | Handball | Surfing |              |


Finally, we can fill in the last remaining food item:


The person who's food is unknown must be eating a Peach!


Here is the final table:


|               |       1       |    2     |    3    |      4       |
| Food          | Orange      | Cherry   | Peach    | Pear        |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary  | Drama    | Crime    |              |
| Music-Genre   | Techno      | Funk     | Unknown  | Jazz        |
| Pet           | Hedgehog    | Pony     | Lizard   | Goat        |
| Sport         | Weightlifting | Handball | Surfing | Parkour     |

The final answer is:

 Orange Documentary Techno Hedgehog Weightlifting 
 Cherry Drama Funk Pony Handball 
 Peach Crime Unknown Lizard Surfing 
 Pear  Jazz Goat Parkour"
Lv3-5x4-10	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with the following solution:


|               |      1       |     2      |      3      |     4      |

| Transport     | airplane    | bus        | scooter    | boat       |


Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* From clue 4, we know that the person driving the scooter is also into magic-tricks.
* Clue 2 tells us that the person drinking fanta is on the left of the bus driver. Since the bus can't be in position 1 (because of clue 10), it must be in position 3.
* Using clues 6 and 8, we know that the person drinking lemonade is to the right of the bus driver, and the person watching comedy movies is on the left of the person drinking lemonade. This puts comedy in position 2.
* From clue 9, we know that the person drinking 7up is on the left of the fishing hobbyist. Since the airplane can't be in position 1 (because of clue 10), it must be in position 4. With clue 11, we can put cucumber and soy-milk together.
* Clue 5 places lime to the right of cucumber, so lime is in position 4.
* Using clues 7 and 1, we know that the person watching zombie movies is on the right of the woodworking hobbyist, which puts zombie in position 3.
* From clue 10, we know that romance is on the left of the airplane driver. This places romance in position 1.

Please note that there might be other possible solutions, but this one seems to fit all the given clues.
