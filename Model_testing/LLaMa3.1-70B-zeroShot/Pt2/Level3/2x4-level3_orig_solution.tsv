Lv3-2x4-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 1, we know that the person watching thriller movies is on the left of the person watching crime movies. Since there are only four positions, this means that the thriller movie watcher must be in either position 1 or 2.

Clue 2 confirms this, stating that the person watching crime movies is on the right of the person watching thriller movies.

From clue 6, we know that the person watching thriller movies is driving a bike. Therefore, the bike rider must be in position 1.

| Transport     | Bike     |           |         |          |

Now, let's look at clue 5. The person driving the roller is between the person driving the car and the person driving the motorbike. Since there are only four positions, this means that the car driver must be in either position 1 or 4 (the far left or far right), and the motorbike rider must be in one of the middle two positions.

However, we already know that the bike rider is in position 1. Therefore, the car driver must be in position 4 (far right).

| Transport     | Bike     |           |         | Car      |

Now, let's look at clue 3. The person watching crime movies is on the right of the person watching thriller movies. This means that the crime movie watcher must be in either position 2 or 3.

However, we already know that the roller rider is between the car driver and the motorbike rider (clue 5). Therefore, the motorbike rider cannot be in position 2. This means that the crime movie watcher must be in position 3.

|               |    1     |     2     |    3    |    4     |
| Movie-Genre   | Thriller |          | Crime   |          |
| Transport     | Bike     |           |         | Car      |

Now, let's look at clue 4. The person watching musical movies is on the right of the person driving the motorbike.

This means that the motorbike rider must be in position 2.

|               |    1     |     2     |    3    |    4     |
| Movie-Genre   | Thriller |          | Crime   |          |
| Transport     | Bike     | Motor    |         | Car      |

Finally, we can fill in the remaining gaps. The person watching musical movies must be in position 1 is already occupied by the thriller movie watcher), so they must be in position 4 (but that's occupied by the car driver), or... they must be on the right of the motorbike rider, which means they're not alone in this row, and therefore the roller rider is on their left.

Lv3-2x4-2	"After analyzing the given clues, I'll try to fill in the table.


From clue 6, we know that the person driving the bus is on the far left, so:


|               |   1    |     2      |     3      |   4   |
| Music-Genre   |        |            |            |       |
| Transport     | Bus    |            |            |       |

From clue 5, we know that the fan of rock is on the far right:


|               |   1    |     2      |     3      |   4   |
| Music-Genre   |        |            |            | Rock  |
| Transport     | Bus    |            |            |       |

From clue 3, we know that the fan of techno is on the left of the person driving the trike. Since the person driving the bus is already on the far left, the fan of techno must be in column 2 or 3.


From clue 4, we know that the person driving the trike is on the right of the person driving the helicopter.


Combining these clues, I'll make an educated guess:


|               |   1    |     2      |     3      |   4   |
| Music-Genre   |        | Techno     |            | Rock  |
| Transport     | Bus    | Helicopter | Trike      |       |

From clue 1, we know that the fan of hip-hop is on the left of the person driving the helicopter. Therefore:


|               |   1    |     2      |     3      |   4   |
| Music-Genre   |        | Hip-Hop    | Techno     | Rock  |
| Transport     | Bus    | Helicopter | Trike      |       |

The only music-genre left is Gospel, which must be in column 1.


|               |   1    |     2      |     3      |   4   |
| Music-Genre   | Gospel | Hip-Hop    | Techno     | Rock  |

Finally, the only transport left is Snowmobile, which must be in column 4:

Lv3-2x4-3	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


|               |   1    |   2   |   3    |  4   |
| Music-Genre   | jazz  | house | pop    | rock |
| Pet           | snake | cat   | rabbit | lizard|

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 2, we know the fan of jazz is on the far left (1).
* From clue 1, the owner of the snake must be on the left or right of the fan of jazz. Since there's no one to the left of the jazz fan, the snake owner must be to the right, which puts them in position 2.
* Clue 4 states that the owner of the cat is on the left or right of the fan of house. This means the cat can't be with the jazz fan (1), so it's likely with either house or rock. But from clue 3, we know the rabbit owner is to the left of the rock fan. If we put the cat with the rock fan, this would mean there's no space for the rabbit between pop and rock. So, the cat must be with the house fan (2).
* From clue 5, the owner of the rabbit is on the right of the fan of pop. This means the rabbit can't be in position 1 or 2, so it's likely in position 3.
* Clue 3 states that the rabbit owner is to the left of the rock fan, which puts the rock fan in position 4. 
* The only pet left is the lizard, and the only genre left is pop (which must be in position 3 since the rabbit is on its right).

So, the final solution table with '#############' around it is:

| Nationality   | brazilian | argentine   | indian   | egyptian|
##################


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 1, we know the Indian is on the left of the person who dances. This means the Indian can't be in position 4.

From clue 2, we know the person who fishes is between the person who plays board-games and the Egyptian. Since there are only four positions, this implies that the Egyptian must be in either position 1 or 4 (as the fisher needs to be ""between"" someone).

Clue 3 suggests that the person who fishes is adjacent to the dancer. Combining this with clue 2, we can conclude that the dancer and fisher are likely in positions 3 and 4 (in some order), as they need to be together.

From clue 5, we know that the board-game enthusiast must be on the right of the collector. This limits our options for positions 1-3.

Clue 6 tells us that the Argentine is on the right of the Brazilian. Combining this with the fact that the Indian and Egyptian are in some order (clue 4), we can deduce a likely arrangement for the nationalities: Brazilian, Argentine, ?, ?

Combining all these insights, I arrived at the above solution.

Lv3-2x4-5	"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the far left, so we can fill in the first column.

|            |   1    |    2    |       3       |      4      |
| Beverage   |        |         |               |             |
| Hobby      | Hiking |         |               |             |

2. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking fanta.

This clue doesn't give us enough information to fill in anything yet, so let's move on.

3. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is hiking.

Since hiking is already filled in at column 1, we can place drawing in either column 2 or not at all (since there might be a gap between hiking and drawing). Let's come back to this later.

4. The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking 7up.

This clue gives us a relationship between two beverages, but we still need more information to place them.

5. The person who's hobby is woodworking is the person drinking soy-milk.

We can fill in the last column with this information.

|            |   1    |    2    |       3       |      4      |
| Beverage   |        |         |               | Soy-Milk    |
| Hobby      | Hiking |         |               | Woodworking |

Now, let's revisit clue 3. Since drawing must be on the left or right of hiking, and there is no gap between columns 1 and 2, we can place drawing in column 2.

|            |   1    |    2    |       3       |      4      |
| Beverage   |        |         |               | Soy-Milk    |
| Hobby      | Hiking | Drawing |               | Woodworking |

Clue 4 tells us that fanta is to the right of 7up. Since hot-chocolate must be to the right of fanta (clue 2), we can place these three beverages in columns 2, 3, and 4.

However, we already have drawing in column 2, so we need to adjust the placement of the beverages. Let's swap the hobbies and beverages in columns 2 and 3.

|            |   1    |    2    |       3       |      4      |
| Beverage   |        | Fanta   |               | Soy-Milk    |
| Hobby      | Hiking |         | Drawing/Wood? | Woodworking |

Now, we can fill in the remaining hobbies and beverages.

|            |   1    |    2    |       3       |      4      |
| Beverage   |        | Fanta   | Hot-Chocolate | Soy-Milk    |
| Hobby      | Hiking |         | Drawing       | Woodworking |

But wait, we still need to place 7up! Since fanta is to the right of 7up (clue 4), and hot-chocolate is to the right of fanta (clue 2), 7up must be in column 1.

|            |   1    |    2    |       3       |      4      |
| Beverage   | 7up    | Fanta   | Hot-Chocolate | Soy-Milk    |
| Hobby      | Hiking |         | Drawing       | Woodworking |

Finally, we can fill in the remaining hobby. Since singing is the only hobby left, and it's not woodworking or drawing, it must be in column 2.

Lv3-2x4-6	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|             |   1    |   2   |    3     |   4   |
| Beverage    |        |       |          |       |
| Transport   |        |       |          |       |

 Solution: 


|             |   1    |   2   |    3     |   4   |
| Beverage    | Coffee | Fanta | Soy-milk | Juice |
| Transport   | Boat   | Train | Roller   | Tram  |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 4, we know the person driving the tram is on the far right. This means the transport for column 4 is ""Tram"".

Clue 2 tells us that the person driving the train is between the person driving the tram and the person drinking juice. Since the tram is already on the far right, this means the train must be in column 3 or 2.

However, clue 1 states that the person drinking soy-milk is to the right of the person drinking juice. If we put the juice drinker in column 2, then the soy-milk drinker would have to be in column 3, which means the train driver (who must be between the tram and the juice drinker) can't fit.

Therefore, the juice drinker must be in column 4, which is not possible since that's where the tram driver is. So, we put the juice drinker in column 3, and the soy-milk drinker in column 2 doesn't work either. Hence, we put the juice drinker in column 3, and the soy-milk drinker in column 4 doesn't work since it's already occupied by the tram driver.

Now we try putting the juice drinker in column 3. This means the train driver is in column 2 (between the tram and the juice drinker). We put the soy-milk drinker in column 4, but this creates a problem since there's no space left for the boat (which must be between the train and the coffee).

So we try putting the juice drinker in column 3. This means the soy-milk drinker is in either column 2 or 1 (to the right of the juice drinker). However, if we put the soy-milk drinker in column 2, then there's no space for Fanta since it must be on the left or right of Soy-milk.

Hence, we put the soy-milk drinker in column 1. Then the fanta drinker can go in either column 1 or 3 doesn't work (since it has to be on the left or right of Soy-milk), so the Fanta drinker goes in column 2.

This leaves us with Coffee, which we put in column 1 since it's the only remaining beverage and transport is Boat.


Now that all beverages are assigned, we can find their corresponding transports:


* Soy-milk (column 1) cannot be tram or train since they're already occupied. It also can't be boat (since the coffee drinker would have to go in column 2). Hence soy-milk's transport must be Roller.
* Coffee (column 1) has to be Boat as shown above
* Fanta is between Soy-milk and Juice. Since Tram is on the far right, this means Fanta's transport cannot be tram or train since they're already occupied. It also can't be boat since coffee drinker would have to go in column 2). Hence, the only option for Fanta's transport is Train.
* Soy-milk (column 1) has roller as shown above
* Juice (column 3) cannot have tram or train since they're already occupied. It also can't be boat since coffee drinker would have to go in column 2). Hence, the only option for Juice's transport is Roller but it was assigned to Soy-milk which leaves us with no choice.


So the solution doesn't work out... however if we swap fanta and juice transports, then Fanta will not be between Soy milk and Juice. That breaks a condition so lets try putting Soy milk in column 3:


Now that all beverages are assigned, we can find their corresponding transports:


* Coffee (column 1) has to be Boat.
* Fanta is on the left or right of soy-milk which is in column 3 hence it can't go on column 2 since its transport is not defined however if we put fanta drinker in column 2, then this creates a problem for coffee and boat as it doesn't have space
* If we try putting Fanta drinker in column 1, then Soy milk drinker will be on the right so that works but now Train is between Tram and Juice hence train can go either column 3 or 2 however if we put it in column 3, this leaves us with Roller which has no choice but to occupy a transport which isn't possible
* Hence Fanta goes to column 4 - however that doesn't work since Soy milk must be on the right of Juice so we know its actually in column 1 or 2 and hence cannot have Tram which is already defined.
* Now put Fanta drinker in column 2, this leaves us with fanta having no transport however if we put fanta drinker in column 1 then soy milk can be on the right of juice
* Hence we put fanta in column 4 and Soy milk goes to column 3 which doesn't work hence lets try putting Fanta drinker in column 2 that would mean Juice is between Soy-milk and Tram however it creates a problem for train since it must be between tram and juice. However if you put the train on column 1 then Boat goes to column 2 which works out
* Hence, we can assign Transport Train to column 3 as per clue 2.
* Now its only left with Roller hence we can assign that transport in column 4.



The final solution is:

From clue 3, we know the order of ship and snowmobile: ... Ship ... Snowmobile ...

From clue 6, we know the person driving the ship is between the snowmobile and the Thai. This implies the order is: ... Ship ... Snowmobile ... Thai

Now, let's consider clue 2: The Egyptian is on the far left or far right. Given this constraint, I'll place the Egyptian on the far left (we can try the other option later if needed).

|               |    1     |  2   |   3    |     4      |

| Transport     |          |      |        |            |

From clue 1, we know the van is on the right of the Egyptian. I'll place the van in position 2.

| Transport     |          | Van  |        |            |

Now, let's use clue 4: The Indian is between the French and the Thai. Given the order we derived earlier (Ship ... Snowmobile ... Thai), I'll place the French in position 2 doesn't work (van is already there), so I'll try to fit them elsewhere.

Considering the previous orders, I propose:

|               |    1     |  2   |   3    |     4      |
| Nationality   | Egyptian | French| Indian | Thai       |
| Transport     |          | Van  |        |            |

Now, let's fit in the ship and snowmobile. We know the ship is between the snowmobile and the Thai (clue 6). I'll place the ship in position 3.

|               |    1     |  2   |   3    |     4      |
| Nationality   | Egyptian | French| Indian | Thai       |
| Transport     |          | Van  | Ship  |            |

Finally, we know the snowmobile is on the left of the person driving the ship (clue 3). However, this doesn't work given our current setup. We can swap the positions of the Indian and the French to accommodate this constraint.

Here's the final solution:

Here's how the solution was derived:

* Combining these clues, we can deduce that the order for columns 3-4 is: fishing (mystery), scientific, and then filmmaking (because fishing is on the left of both).
* Now, looking at column 2, we know from clue 1 that horror movies are on the right of filmmaking. Since column 3 already has filmmaking, horror movies must be in column 2.
* The only remaining hobby for column 4 is drawing (because board-games is already paired with superhero movies).
* Finally, the only remaining movie-genre for column 1 is superhero.

From clue 5, the owner of the chinchilla can be on either far left or far right. Let's try both possibilities.

**Case 1: Chinchilla on far left**

Since the person who's sport is volleyball owns a snake, and there are no more pets to assign, this solution works.

Here's the final table:

#############
|         |     1      |   2    |     3      |     4      |
| Pet     | Chinchilla | Fish   | Horse      | Snake      |
| Sport   | Tennis     |        | Skiing     | Volleyball |
#############

Note that the second row in column 2 is left blank as there are no more sports to assign.

In Case 1, we have already found a solution. Let's verify if it works when the chinchilla is on the far right (Case 2).

**Case 2: Chinchilla on far right**

|         |     1      |   2    |     3      |     4      |
| Pet     |            |        |            | Chinchilla |
| Sport   |            |        |            |            |

From clue 4, the owner of the fish is to the left of the chinchilla.

|         |     1      |   2    |     3      |     4      |
| Pet     |            | Fish   |            | Chinchilla |
| Sport   |            |        |            |            |

However, from clue 6, we cannot find a valid position for the person who's sport is skiing. Therefore, this case does not lead to a solution.

Since only Case 1 leads to a valid solution, we can conclude that:

#############
|         |     1      |   2    |     3      |     4      |
| Pet     | Chinchilla | Fish   | Horse      | Snake      |
| Sport   | Tennis     |        | Skiing     | Volleyball |

Lv3-2x4-10	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |     1     |     2      |     3     |    4    |
| Music-Genre   |  Salsa    | Jazz       | Electronic| Classical|
| Nationality   | Nigerian  | Russian    | Chinese   | Argentine|
#############

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 1, we know the Argentine is on the right of the Chinese.
From clue 3, we know the Chinese person likes Electronic music, so they must be in position 3.

From clue 4, we know the Nigerian is on the left of the Chinese, so they must be in position 1 or 2. Since the Russian is not mentioned as being adjacent to the Chinese, they must be in position 2 (between the Nigerian and the Chinese).

Clue 5 tells us that the Salsa fan is next to the Argentine. Since the Argentine is on the right of the Chinese, the Salsa fan must be either in position 1 or 4.

Now we can use clue 2: The Jazz fan is between the Russian and the Chinese. This means the Jazz fan must be in position 2. But wait, we already placed the Russian in position 2! However, this is a contradiction only if we assume the Russian is not the same person as the Jazz fan.

So, let's re-evaluate: The Nigerian can't be the Jazz fan (since they're on the left of the Chinese), but the Russian could be. This means the Russian and the Jazz fan are actually the same person!

With this new information, we can fill in the remaining blanks:

* Position 1: Nigerian, who must like Salsa music (since it's next to the Argentine)
* Position 2: Russian/Jazz
* Position 3: Chinese/Electronic
* Position 4: Argentine, who likes Classical music (the only one left)

And that's how we arrive at the solution table!"
