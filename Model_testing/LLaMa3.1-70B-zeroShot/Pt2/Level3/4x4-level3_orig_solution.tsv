Lv3-4x4-2	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


|               |      1      |     2     |       3        |      4       |
| Job           | bartender   | electrician | photographer   | police-officer|
| Nationality   | indian      | australian | turkish        | malaysian    |
| Sport         | tennis      | soccer      | rowing         | ice-hockey   |
| Transport     | trike       | car         | tram           | roller       |

 
Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 8, we know that the person driving the car is on the far left or far right. From clue 4, we know that the bartender is between the indian and the person driving the car. Since the indian cannot be on the far left (because they are to the left of the turkish), the person driving the car must be on the far left.

From clue 2, we know that the electrician is australian. From clue 9, we know that the indian is to the left of the turkish. Therefore, the order of nationalities is: indian, australian, turkish, malaysian (since there are no other options).

From clue 3, we know that the person driving the tram is the photographer.

From clue 7, we know that the person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the far right. From clue 1, we know that the person who's sport is soccer is to the left of the person who's sport is rowing. Therefore, the order of sports is: tennis (since it's not given in any other clues), soccer, rowing, ice-hockey.

From clue 6, we know that the person driving the trike is the one whose sport is tennis.

Finally, from clue 5, we know that the person driving the car is to the left of the person driving the roller. Therefore, the order of transports is: trike, car, tram, roller.

Lv3-4x4-3	"Here is the solved logic puzzle:


|               |     1      |    2    |      3      |     4      |
| Food          | grapefruit | potato  | cauliflower | peach       |

| Sport         | cricket    | ice-hockey | volleyball | cycling     |

The steps to solve the puzzle are as follows:

1. From clue 2, we know that the fan of folk is on the far left or far right.
2. From clue 7, we know that the fan of folk is on the left of the person who's sport is cricket. Combining this with step 1, we can conclude that the fan of folk is on the far left (column 1).
3. From clue 10, we know that the person eating grapefruit is on the left or right of the person eating potato.
4. From clue 9, we know that the person eating potato is on the left of the person eating cauliflower.
5. Combining steps 3 and 4, we can conclude that the order of food from left to right is: grapefruit, potato, cauliflower.
6. From clue 1, we know that the fan of indie is the person eating peach. Therefore, peach must be in column 4 (the only remaining spot).
7. From clue 5, we know that the owner of the turtle is on the left of the fan of rock.
8. Combining steps 2 and 7, we can conclude that the order of pets from left to right is: turtle, ?, ?, hedgehog.
9. From clue 6, we know that the person who's sport is cycling is on the left or right of the person who's sport is volleyball.
10. Combining steps 8 and 9, we can conclude that the order of sports from left to right is: cricket, ice-hockey, volleyball, cycling.
11. From clue 3, we know that the person eating potato is on the left or right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
12. Combining steps 5 and 11, we can conclude that the person eating potato must be in column 2 (since potato is already known to be next to grapefruit).
13. From clue 4, we know that the owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling.
14. Combining steps 10 and 13, we can conclude that the order of pets from left to right is: turtle, cat, dog, hedgehog.

Lv3-4x4-4	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


|               |     1      |      2       |     3     |      4       |
| Job           |            |              |           |              |
| Movie-Genre   | Satire    | Epic         | Family    | Scientific  |
| Nationality   | Canadian  | Australian  | French    | Polish      |
| Pet           | Rabbit    | Chinchilla   | Horse     | Snake       |

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

From clue 4, we know that the person watching satire movies is on the far left.

From clue 6, we know that the Canadian is either on the far left or far right. Since the person watching satire movies is already on the far left (from clue 4), and the Canadian can't be in the same position as the person watching satire movies, the Canadian must also be on the far left. This means that the first column is filled.

From clue 1, we know that the person watching family movies is to the right of the person watching epic movies. Therefore, the second column must be epic, and the third column must be family.

From clue 2, we know that the Australian is to the right of the person watching satire movies. This means that the Australian is in the second column.

From clue 5, we know that the French is watching scientific movies, which can only be in the fourth column.

Now we have:


|               |     1      |      2       |     3     |      4       |
| Job           |            |              |           |              |
| Movie-Genre   | Satire    | Epic         | Family    | Scientific  |
| Nationality   | Canadian  | Australian  | ?        | French      |

From clue 7, we know that the owner of the rabbit is to the left of the owner of the snake. This means that the owner of the rabbit must be in either column 1 or 2.

From clue 9, we know that the librarian is on either side of the owner of the snake. Since the owner of the snake can't be in the first two columns (because the owner of the rabbit must be to its left), the owner of the snake must be in the third column.

Now we have:


|               |     1      |      2       |     3     |      4       |
| Job           |            |              |           |              |
| Movie-Genre   | Satire    | Epic         | Family    | Scientific  |
| Nationality   | Canadian  | Australian  | ?        | French      |
| Pet           | Rabbit    | ?           | Snake     |             |

From clue 8, we know that the videographer is between the owner of the chinchilla and the Polish. Since the Polish can't be in column 1 (Canadian), 2 (Australian), or 4 (French), it must be in column 3. This means that the videographer must be in either column 2 or 3.

However, from clue 8, we also know that the videographer is between the owner of the chinchilla and the Polish. Since the Polish is in column 3, the owner of the chinchilla must be to its left, which means it can only be in column 2.

Now we have:


|               |     1      |      2       |     3     |      4       |
| Job           |            |              |           |              |
| Movie-Genre   | Satire    | Epic         | Family    | Scientific  |
| Nationality   | Canadian  | Australian  | Polish    | French      |
| Pet           | Rabbit    | Chinchilla   | Snake     |             |

Finally, from clue 3, we know that the photographer is watching scientific movies. Since the person watching scientific movies is already in column 4 (French), this means that the photographer must be the one with the nationality ""French"".

The only remaining pet is the horse, which can only go to column 3.

From the given jobs, the librarian is the only one left for the Canadian. The videographer can't be Australian because it's between the owner of the chinchilla and Polish (from clue 8), so the videographer must be the Australian or the Canadian. However, since the Canadian is a librarian, the videographer must be the Australian.

The last remaining job is the lawyer, which goes to column 3.

Lv3-4x4-6	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a solution that satisfies all the conditions. Here's the final table:


|             |     1      |   2    |      3      |     4      |
| Beverage    |            |        |             |            |
| Food        | watermelon | papaya | grapes      | raspberry  |
| Pet         | lizard     | mouse  | cat         | rabbit     |
| Transport   | scooter    | trike  | train       | snowmobile |

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 11, we know that the owner of the lizard is eating watermelon. From clue 6, we can place this person to the left of the person eating grapes.

Clue 1 tells us that the person eating grapes is on the left of the person driving the train. Clue 2 places the cat's owner next to the person driving the train.

From clue 4 and 8, we know that the rabbit's owner is on the far right and drives a snowmobile. Clue 10 also tells us that the person drinking fanta is on the far right.

Using clues 3, 7, and 9, we can now fill in the remaining gaps. The person eating papaya is next to the person drinking almond-milk (clue 7), who must be on the left or right of the cat's owner (due to the constraints). The person drinking soy-milk is next to the person eating grapes.

Finally, clue 5 places the trike driver between the person eating watermelon and raspberry. The only remaining option for the scooter driver is in column 1.

The solution fits all the conditions:

Lv3-4x4-7	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
| Hobby         | collecting  | hiking     | magic-tricks | puzzles   |
| Music-Genre   | classical   | gospel     | pop          | salsa     |
| Pet           | horse       | mouse      | bird         | pony      |
| Sport         | baseball    | basketball | parkour      | tennis    |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 1, we know the person who likes hiking is to the left of the gospel fan.
* From clue 2, we know the person who likes hiking is also to the left of the mouse owner.
* From clue 3, we know the basketball player is to the right of the horse owner.
* Clue 4 tells us that parkour is next to the mouse owner. Since the mouse owner is already placed between hiking and gospel (from clues 1 and 2), parkour must be on the left side of the table, as there's no room for it on the right side without violating other constraints.
* Clue 5 places basketball between collecting and baseball. Given that horse is already next to basketball (clue 3), this means collecting must be on the far left, followed by baseball, then basketball, and finally horse.
* From clue 6, we know salsa is paired with tennis.
* Clue 7 places mouse between parkour and bird. Since parkour is already on the left side, this means bird must be in the second position from the right.
* Clue 8 pairs pop with magic-tricks.
* Clue 9 confirms that gospel is to the right of basketball.
* Finally, clue 10 allows baseball to be next to hiking, which completes the arrangement.

Lv3-4x4-8	"After solving the logic puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


|               |     1      |     2     |       3       |     4     |
| Beverage      | Cola (P)   | Fanta (PL)| hot-choco te  | Iced-Tea    |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic       | Musical   | Scientific    | Sports     |
| Nationality   | Pakistani  | Polish    | Egyptian      | Malaysian  |
| Sport         | Ice-Hockey | Handball  | Baseball      | Surfing     |

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* From clue 7, we know that the person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the far left.
* Clue 11 tells us that the Pakistani is drinking cola, and since they're also on the far left or right (clue 4), it makes sense for them to be in position 1.
* Clue 9 says that the Polish person drinks Fanta, so we can place them in position 2.
* Since the Polish person is on the left of the person watching musical movies (clue 5), musical movies must be in position 3 or 4. But since epic movies are to the left of Malaysian nationality (clue 10), it's more likely that epic movies are in position 1 and musical movies are in position 2.
* The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing, which must be baseball or handball. Given the constraints from other clues, we can conclude that the person with hot-chocolate watches scientific movies, and the person with surfing as their sport must be in position 4.
* Clue 2 says that the person watching scientific movies has handball to their left or right. Since epic movies are already on the far left, it's more likely that handball is in position 2, and baseball is in position 3.
* The Egyptian is to the right of the person drinking iced-tea (clue 3), so we can place them in position 4.
* Malaysian nationality must be with the sports movie genre, since all other nationalities are already assigned.

Please note that this solution assumes a unique answer exists. If there are multiple possible solutions, I'd be happy to try and explore those as well!"

#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

* Clues 1 and 5 establish that the person who owns a pony is the one whose sport is volleyball, which places them in column 4.
* Clue 2 places the designer between the dog owner (column 3) and the pony owner (column 4).
* Clue 4 implies that the fish owner is to the right of the pony owner, so they must be in column 1.
* Clues 8 and 9 help determine the order of jobs: teacher-fish (column 1), designer-dog (column 3), writer-chinchilla (column 2), and videographer-pony (column 4).
* The remaining clues fill in the hobby and sport columns.
