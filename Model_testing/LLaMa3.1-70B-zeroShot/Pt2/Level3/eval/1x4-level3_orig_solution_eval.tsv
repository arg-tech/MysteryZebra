Lv3-1x4-1	"Let's break down the clues:


1. The person eating blueberry is on the far left.
	* This means that Blueberry is in position 1.

2. The person eating cranberry is on the left or right of the person eating blueberry
	* Since Blueberry is already in position 1, Cranberry must be in either position 2 (to the right) or position 4 does not have a neighbor to the left so it can't go there.

3. The person eating cranberry is on the left or right of the person eating kale
	* Now that we know Cranberry is likely in position 2, Kale must be either in position 1 (but Blueberry is already there) or position 3.


Considering these constraints:


Blueberry can only go in position 1.
Cranberry must go next to Blueberry, which leaves only one option: position 2. 
Kale goes next to Cranberry and since it cannot be on the left of cranberry, it has to go in position 3
The remaining food (radish) will take the last spot.


Here is the solution table:


|        |     1     |     2     |  3   |   4    |
| Food   | Blueberry | Cranberry | Kale | Radish |


 Final Solution:

Lv3-1x4-2	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 2, we know that water is on the left of iced-tea.

Since iced-tea is on the far left or far right (clue 3), and water is on the left of iced-tea, iced-tea must be on the far right. If it were on the far left, there would be no room for water to its left.

So, we have:

|            |   1   |   2    |   3   |    4     |
| Beverage   | water |        |       | iced-tea |

From clue 1, coffee is on the right of fanta. Since iced-tea is already occupying the far right spot, coffee and fanta must be in spots 2 and 3.

The order of coffee and fanta can be either (fanta, coffee) or (coffee, fanta). However, since coffee is on the right of fanta, it must be:

(fanta, coffee)

So, we have:

|            |   1   |   2    |   3   |    4     |
| Beverage   | water | fanta  | coffee| iced-tea |

Lv3-1x4-3	"Let's analyze the clues:


1. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing.
   This means that the order must be: ..., card-games, fishing.

2. The person who's hobby is baking is on the far left or far right.
   This gives us two possible orders:
   - Baking, ?, ?, fishing
   - ?, ?, ?, Baking

3. The person who's hobby is fishing is on the far right.
   This means that we can only use the second order from clue 2: 
   - ?, ?, ?, Baking (no, this would put fishing in the middle)
   We must have: ..., card-games, fishing and it has to end with ..., Baking doesn't fit. So our final order is:
   - ?, card-games, fishing

The only hobby left for the first column is drawing or baking. But baking can't be there (it's on the far left/right), so we have:


- Drawing, card-games, ?, fishing


Now we just need to put Baking on the far right.


We get:

Lv3-1x4-4	"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The person watching spy movies is on the far right.
2. The person watching spy movies is on the right of the person watching superhero movies.
3. The person watching animation movies is on the left or right of the person watching superhero movies.

From clue 1, we know the spy movie watcher is in position 4.

|               |    1    |     2     |     3     |  Spy |
| Movie-Genre   |         |           |           |     |

From clue 2, we know the superhero movie watcher must be to the left of the spy movie watcher. Since there is only one position between them, the superhero movie watcher must be in position 3.

|               |    1    |     2     | Superhero |  Spy |
| Movie-Genre   |         |           |           |     |

From clue 3, we know the animation movie watcher is on the left or right of the superhero movie watcher. Since the superhero movie watcher is in position 3, the animation movie watcher must be in either position 1 or 2.

We can try both options:

**Option 1:**
|               | Animation |     2     | Superhero |  Spy |
| Movie-Genre   |         |           |           |     |

In this case, the only remaining genre is musical, which must be in position 2.

**Option 2:**
|               |    1    | Animation | Superhero |  Spy |
| Movie-Genre   |         |           |           |     |

In this case, the only remaining genre is musical, which must be in position 1. However, this would mean that animation is not on the left or right of superhero, so this option is not valid.

Therefore, the correct solution is:

#############
|               | Animation | Musical   | Superhero |  Spy |
| Movie-Genre   |         |           |           |     |

Lv3-1x4-5	"Based on the given clues, I'll solve the logic puzzle and fill in the table.


From clue 1, we know that Basketball is either at position 1 or 4.

From clue 2, we know that Golf is to the right of Surfing.

From clue 3, we know that Basketball is to the right of Golf. Combining this with clue 1, Basketball must be at position 4 (since it's on the far right). Also, since Golf is to the left of Basketball and to the right of Surfing, Golf can't be in position 1.

Now, let's place Surfing at position 1 (if it were in any other position, we'd have a contradiction with clue 2).

So, the order is: Surfing, ?, Golf, Basketball

The only sport left is Weightlifting. It must go to position 2.


Here's the final solution table:

Lv3-1x4-6	"Based on the given clues, let's analyze and solve the puzzle:


From clue 2, we know that the person watching mystery movies is next to the person watching crime movies.


From clue 4, we know that the person watching crime movies is to the right of the person watching mystery movies. This means the order for these two genres is: mystery -> crime


From clue 1, we know that the person watching animation movies is to the left of the person watching mystery movies. So, the updated order is: animation -> mystery -> crime


Finally, from clue 3, we know that the person watching zombie movies is to the right of the person watching crime movies. This completes the order:


animation -> mystery -> crime -> zombie

Here's the final solution table:

Lv3-1x4-7	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 2, we know the order is: Juice, Iced-Tea, ??, ??
From clue 1, we know Fanta is to the right of Iced-Tea, so the order becomes: Juice, Iced-Tea, Fanta, ??

Now, let's consider clue 3. Since Fanta is already on the right side of Iced-Tea, Coffee must be to the left of Fanta or to the very left (since it can't be in between Juice and Iced-Tea). But if Coffee were to the left of Juice, then Fanta wouldn't be directly next to Coffee. Therefore, the only possibility is that Coffee is on the far left.

So, the final order is: Coffee, Juice, Iced-Tea, Fanta

Here is the solution table:

Lv3-1x4-8	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |      1      |    2     |   3    |   4    |
| Movie-Genre   |             |          |        |        |
|               | Documentary | Disaster | Comedy | Sports |

 

Here's how the clues led me to this solution:

* Clue 2: The person watching documentary movies is on the left of the person watching disaster movies, so Documentary must be in position 1.
* Clue 1: The person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person watching comedy movies, so Disaster must be in position 2.
* Clue 3 and 4: Since Comedy is already determined to be on the right of Disaster (from Clue 1), it must be in position 3. Sports can only be in position 4, as it's not specified to be next to any other genre.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv3-1x4-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.


From clue 2, we know that epic is either on the far left or far right.


From clue 1, we know that disaster is next to epic.


From clue 3, we know that adventure is to the left of fantasy.


From clue 4, we know that fantasy is on the far right.


Now, let's combine these clues:


Since fantasy is on the far right (clue 4) and adventure is to its left (clue 3), the order for these two genres is:


... | Adventure | Fantasy


We also know that epic is on one of the ends. If it were on the far right, disaster would be next to it (clue 1), but this would conflict with fantasy being on the far right. So, epic must be on the far left.


Now we have:


Epic | ... | Adventure | Fantasy


Finally, since disaster is next to epic (clue 1) and epic is on the far left, disaster must be in position 2.


So, the final solution table is:

Lv3-1x4-10	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person eating broccoli is on the right of the person eating strawberry.
2. The person eating broccoli is between the person eating avocado and the person eating strawberry.

From these two clues, we can deduce that the order is: Avocado - Broccoli - Strawberry (or Strawberry - Broccoli - Avocado)

3. The person eating avocado is on the left or right of the person eating pumpkin.
4. This clue is identical to clue 3, so it doesn't add any new information.

Considering all the clues, we can try to find a possible arrangement:

Since Avocado and Pumpkin are next to each other (from clue 3), and Broccoli is between Avocado and Strawberry (from clue 2), one possible order is: Avocado - Pumpkin - Broccoli - Strawberry

Here's the final solution table:
