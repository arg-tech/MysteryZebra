Here's the explanation for each row:


1. Beverage: Clue 2 places almond-milk on the right of electronic (person 3). Clue 7 also places r&b next to almond-milk, and clue 14 places soccer next to fanta. From these clues, we can deduce the beverage order.


2. Hobby: Clue 10 places video-games at the far left, and clue 13 places fishing on the right of video-games. Clue 9 places board-games between mouse and soccer, which is already placed in the beverage row.


3. Music-Genre: Clues 1, 4, and 7 place house next to water-polo (person 3) and r&b next to almond-milk (person 3). Clue 16 places folk as the fan of water-polo. From these clues, we can deduce the music-genre order.


4. Pet: Clue 18 places lizard on the right of folk, which is already placed in the music-genre row. Clue 11 places hedgehog on the left of milk (person 4). Clue 8 places fish as the pet of the jet-ski owner (person 5).


5. Sport: Clues 3, 9, and 14 place soccer between mouse and board-games. Clue 16 places water-polo as the fan of folk. From these clues, we can deduce the sport order.


6. Transport: Clue 21 places scooter next to tram (person 2). Clue 6 places bike at the far right, which is already placed in person 5. Clue 8 places jet-ski with fish (person 5).

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:

* From clue 4, the owner of the turtle eats peach, so column 1 is set.
* Clue 2 sets the doctor as the owner of the chinchilla, and since the doctor is in the middle (clue 14), column 3 is set for the job and pet.
* Clues 7 and 15 set the person drinking soy-milk as the owner of the ferret, which must be on the right of the italian (clue 8).
* Clue 10 sets the person eating lemon as the person drinking milk, so column 4 is set for food and beverage.
* Clues 1 and 20 set the relative positions of the person eating lemon and the indonesian, and since the british is on the left of the person drinking milk (clue 17), columns 2-4 are partially set for nationality.
* The rest of the clues can be used to fill in the remaining gaps.

| Transport     | helicopter   | bus             | taxi        | tram        | boat         |

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:


From clues 1 and 19, we know that the person watching animation movies is also the owner of the horse. From clue 2, we know that the person watching epic movies is on the left of the owner of the horse.


Clue 3 tells us that the person whose hobby is dancing is on the left of the pilot. Clue 20 suggests that the pilot is either to the left or right of the person whose hobby is dancing. Since there's no other available position for the pilot, they must be to the right of the dancer.


From clue 4, we know that the chef drives the tram. Clues 9 and 21 suggest that the chef (tram driver) is on the right of the card-game enthusiast or the photographer. This implies that the card-game enthusiast or photographer can't drive the taxi, since they'd be too far to the left.


Clue 10 tells us that the project-manager is on the left of the owner of the rabbit. Clues 14 and 17 suggest that the boat driver is between the adventure movie fan (who eats kale) and the cauliflower eater. Since the project-manager can't drive a boat, they must be driving a bus.


With this information in mind, we can deduce that the person watching scientific movies must eat pineapple, since they're too far to the right for any other food. The owner of the chinchilla is then forced into position 1.


From clue 5, we know that the radish eater is on the far right. Clues 13 and 18 tell us that the cauliflower eater and romance movie fan are next to each other. Since they can't be next to the kale eater (adventure movies), they must be in positions 2 and 3.


The rest of the puzzle falls into place using similar logic, considering all possible positions for each person.

| Transport     | helicopter| bike             | quad-bike     | snowmobile  | trike     |

Note: I've used the given clues to fill in the table. The solution is unique.

The explanation for the solution is as follows:

* Clue 1 and 2 imply that the dressmaker is on the left or right of the person driving the bike.
* Clue 5 implies that the person eating onion drives a bike.
* Clues 8 and 15 imply that the person watching crime movies is in position 2, and the project-manager is in position 3.
* Clue 11 implies that the software-developer is on the right of the person watching disaster movies.
* Clue 19 implies that the software-developer is between the dressmaker and the person eating radish.
* Clue 16 implies that the owner of the horse drives a snowmobile.
* Clues 3, 9, and 17 imply that the fan of rock is on the right of the software-developer, and the fan of classical is between the person driving the snowmobile and the fan of rock.
* Clue 4 implies that the person driving the helicopter is the fan of salsa.
* Clues 7 and 13 imply that the owner of the horse is on the left of the person eating lime, and the owner of the rabbit drives a quad-bike.
* Clue 10 implies that the person watching musical movies drives a trike.
* Clues 6, 14, and 18 imply that the person eating radish eats radish (a tautology!), the owner of the frog is on the right of the person watching disaster movies, and the owner of the goat is on the left or right of the person watching scientific movies.

By using these clues and some logical deductions, we can arrive at the unique solution above.
