Lv3-5x2-1	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |      1      |     2      |
| Food          | cauliflower | artichoke  |
| Nationality   | italian     | chinese    |
| Pet           | pony        | frog       |
| Sport         | cricket     | golf       |
| Transport     | taxi        | snowmobile |

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 4, we know the owner of the frog is on the far right. From clue 1, this person also drives a snowmobile.

Clue 2 tells us that the owner of the frog (far right) is next to the owner of the pony. Since there are only two people, the pony's owner must be on the left.

From clue 3, we know that the person eating cauliflower is next to the Italian. Since the pony's owner is already determined to be on the left, and the frog's owner (far right) can't be next to the Italian, the person eating cauliflower must be on the left as well.

Clue 5 states that the person who plays golf is on the right of the person eating cauliflower. This means the golfer is on the far right, which corresponds with the frog's owner and snowmobile driver from clue 1.

Now we can fill in the gaps:

* The Italian must be next to the person eating cauliflower (clue 3), so they're on the left.
* The only remaining food is artichoke, which goes to the Chinese person on the right.
* Cricket is the only sport left, which corresponds with the person on the left.

And that's the solution!



Here it is again with the requested formatting:

| Pet           | guinea-pig |   frog       |
| Sport         |  rowing    | skateboarding|

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 1, we know that the person who reads eats papaya, so papaya is in column 2.

From clue 2, we know that the fan of d&b is to the left of the person eating papaya, so d&b must be in column 1.

From clue 4, we know that the fan of electronic is the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since electronic is not in column 1 (d&b is), it must be in column 2. And since skateboarding is also in column 2, this matches with the electronic fan.

Now, looking at clue 3, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since skateboarding is in column 2, and rowing must be in one of the columns (there are only two sports), rowing must be in column 1. And since guinea-pig can't be with skateboarding (because it would be on top or below it, not left or right), guinea-pig must be in column 1.

The only hobby left is board-games, which goes to column 1.

Finally, the only food left is corn, which goes to column 1.

And that's how we arrive at the solution!

| Music-Genre   | Ambient     | Salsa       |

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 2, we know that the person watching spy movies is drinking lemonade. This means Lemonade must be on the right (column 2).

Clue 1 tells us that the fan of salsa is on the far right, which confirms that Salsa is in column 2.

Clue 4 states that Papaya is on the left or right of Lemonade. Since Papaya can't be in column 2 (Lemonade is already there), it must be in column 1.

From clue 3, we know Singing is to the left of Thriller movies. This means Singing and Thriller are in columns 1 and 2, respectively, but with Ambien music being an unknown at this point. However since the salsa fan is on the far right that can only mean the person listening to ambient music has singing as his hobby

Now we have a possible solution:

| Music-Genre   | d&b          | folk     |
| Transport     | airplane     | train    |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 3, we know that the person watching family movies is on the far left or far right. Since the person driving the airplane is also the one watching family movies (clue 2), and they can't be in both positions, we'll place them on the left side.

Now, from clue 1, the person rock-climbing must be to the left or right of the person driving the airplane. Since there's no room to their left, they must be to their right, which means they're in column 2.

Clue 4 tells us that the person eating apple is to the right of the fan of d&b. Clue 5 says they're also to the right of the person driving the train. This implies that the person driving the train and the person listening to d&b must be in column 1, with the person eating asparagus.

Finally, we can fill in the remaining gaps:

* The person dancing is in column 2 (the only one left).
* The person watching musical movies is also in column 2 (since family movies are already taken by the person driving the airplane).
* Folk music must be paired with the person eating apple, and d&b is already with the person eating asparagus.

| Transport     |            | Snowmobile |

From clue 4, we know that the fan of salsa is on the left of the owner of the horse.

| Transport     |            | Snowmobile |

From clue 1, we know that the person whose hobby is baking is on the left or right of the fan of salsa.


Since the fan of salsa is already on the left side, and there's no more space to the left, the person whose hobby is baking must be on the right side. But wait, the person on the right side is already driving a snowmobile! So, this clue doesn't help us with the hobbies yet.


Let's look at the remaining options:


* The only music-genre left is hip-hop.
* The only pet left is frog.
* The only hobby left for person 1 is filmmaking (since baking is taken by person 2).
* The only beverage left is cola.


Here's the updated table:

| Transport     | roller      | helicopter|
#############

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


From clue 4, we know that the owner of the ferret is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Therefore, the ferret and almond-milk must be in column 1.


Clue 2 states that the owner of the hamster is on the right of the person who's sport is rowing. This means that rowing must be in column 1, as the hamster cannot be on the left of rowing.


Now, clue 3 tells us that the fan of indie is on the left or right of the person driving the roller. Since we already have rowing and ferret/almond-milk in column 1, indie and roller must be in columns 1 and 2, respectively.


Clue 1 states that the owner of the ferret is on the left or right of the fan of indie. This means that indie must be in column 1, as the ferret is already there.


The only remaining music-genre, rock, goes to column 2.


Finally, we place lacrosse (the remaining sport) and helicopter (the remaining transport) in column 2.


We also place juice (the remaining beverage) and hamster (the remaining pet) in column 2.

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 3, we know that the person eating broccoli is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess. This means broccoli must be in column 1 and chess in column 2.

Clue 4 tells us that the person driving the jet-ski is the owner of the lizard. Since there are only two transport options, this means roller must be associated with broccoli (column 1) and jet-ski with the lizard (column 2).

Now, from clue 2, we know that the person eating broccoli is on the left of the owner of the lizard, which confirms our previous conclusion.

Clue 1 states that the person who's hobby is chess is on the left or right of the fan of gospel. Since chess is in column 2 and gospel can't be associated with broccoli (otherwise, it would contradict clue 3), gospel must be associated with asparagus (column 2).

The only music-genre left for column 1 is punk.

Lastly, we know that puzzles is not associated with chess (from clue 3), so puzzles must be the hobby of the person eating broccoli."	{'food': ['broccoli', 'asparagus'], 'hobby': ['puzzles', 'chess'], 'music-genre': ['gospel', 'punk'], 'pet': ['guinea-pig', 'lizard'], 'transport': ['roller', 'jet-ski']}	True	10	True

Here's my reasoning:


From clue (1), we know the person driving the airplane is on the right of the person drinking water. Since there are only two columns, this means Water must be in column 1 and Airplane must be in column 2.


From clue (2), we know the owner of the goat is on the right of the person eating grapes. This implies that Grapes must be in column 1 and Goat must be in column 2.


From clue (3), we know the person eating grapes is on the left or right of the Thai person. Since Grapes is already placed in column 1, this means Thai must be in column 2.


The remaining options can be filled in as follows:


Nectarine must go with Thai, and Argentine must go with Water.


Guinea-pig must go with Argentine (since Goat is already paired with Thai).

Explanation:

From clue 4, we know that the owner of the hedgehog is on the far left. This means column 1 must be the hedgehog's owner.

From clue 2, we know that the person driving the trike is on the left or right of the polish. Since the polish can't be in column 1 (because of the hedgehog), it must be in column 2. And since the trike driver is next to the polish, they must be in column 1.

From clue 3, we know that the person drinking water is on the right of the person watching drama movies. This means that the person drinking water (column 2) must watch a different genre than drama, so they watch satire. And since the drama movie-goer can't be in column 2 (because of the polish and trike), they must be in column 1.

From clue 1, we know that the person driving the trike is on the left of the polish. This means that the trike driver (column 1) must drink mirinda (since the water drinker is in column 2).

The only remaining option for nationality in column 1 is spanish.

And finally, since ferret is the only remaining pet option, it goes to column 2.
