| Sport         | climbing  | swimming  | tennis         | snowboarding    | cycling      | cricket    |

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

From clue 1, we know the dressmaker owns a rabbit. From clue 6, we know the person who likes tennis is on the left of the dressmaker.

From clue 11, the fan of blues is either on the far left or far right. Since the person who likes climbing (blues) is also on the far left (clue 9 and 10), we can place them in position 1.

Clue 4 tells us that the country fan is into cycling. Clue 14 places swimming to the left of country, so we have swimming in position 2.

From clue 3, the fisherman is on the left of the person who likes sudoku. Since the fisherman is also on the left of the tennis enthusiast (clue 8), we can place the fisherman in position 2 and the software developer in position 3 (who likes sudoku).

Now, using clues 7 and 12, we can figure out that the social worker is between magic-tricks and metal. Clue 21 places the social worker next to magic-tricks, so we have social worker in position 4.

Using clue 17 and 2, we know filmmaking (dubstep) is on the right of sudoku. This means the person who likes dubstep must be in position 3.

The rest of the puzzle falls into place using clues 13, 15, 18, 19, 20, 22, and 24.

#############


Let me walk you through the thought process:

1. From clue 12, we know that the person drinking 7up is on the far right (position 6).
2. Clue 14 and 19 together tell us that the polish person's hobby is chess, which must be either on the far left or far right (clue 10). Since the polish person can't be on the far right (already occupied by the 7up drinker), they must be on the far left.
3. Clue 5 tells us that the polish person owns a pony, so we can fill in the pet column for position 1.
4. From clue 8, we know that the person driving the skateboard has a hobby of gardening. Since this person is not on the far right (occupied by the 7up drinker), they must be somewhere in the middle.
5. Clue 18 tells us that the owner of the horse is to the left of the skateboard driver. Given the existing positions, we can place the horse owner at position 2.
6. From clue 17 and 9 (which essentially says the same thing as 17), we know that the coffee drinker is on the left of the jet-ski driver. Since the american is to the left of the coffee drinker (clue 22), the american must be at position 2.
7. Clue 4 places the mouse owner between the dog owner and the van driver. Given the existing positions, we can place the mouse owner at position 3, with the van driver at position 5.
8. The rest of the puzzle can be solved by filling in the remaining gaps using the other clues.

From clues 19 and 20, the australian drinks hot-chocolate and drives the motorbike. From clue 18, the person drinking hot-chocolate is also the person who's sport is cycling.

From clue 3, the person driving the van is on the right of the british. From clue 15, the person driving the van is on the far right. From clue 17, the person driving the snowmobile is the british.

From clues 11 and 6, the person watching comedy movies drinks sprite and is on the right of the person watching drama movies. From clue 9, the person watching drama movies is on the right of the person driving the motorbike (australian).

From clues 4 and 5, the person watching drama movies is on the right of the australian and the person driving the motorbike.

From clue 10, the person watching crime movies is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. From clue 14, the person driving the trike is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile (british).

From clues 2 and 8, the russian is on the left of the egyptian and the egyptian is on the left or right of the person watching satire movies.

From clue 12, the person who's sport is surfing is on the left or right of the person driving the roller. From clue 13, the australian is on the left of the polish.
