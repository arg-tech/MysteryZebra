Lv3-3x2-1	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 1, we know that the person who likes surfing is to the right of the fan of d&b.

From clue 2, we know that the person eating mango is on either side of the fan of soul.

Since there are only two columns, we can deduce that the fan of soul must be in column 1 (if they were in column 2, the person eating mango would have to be outside the table!).

Now, let's try to place the fan of d&b. If they were in column 2, then the person who likes surfing would have to be outside the table (since they are to the right of the fan of d&b). Therefore, the fan of d&b must be in column 1.

We can now fill in some values:

|               |     1     |    2    |
| Food          |           |         |
| Music-Genre   | soul      |         |
| Sport         |           | surfing |

From clue 1, we know that the person who likes surfing is to the right of the fan of d&b. Therefore, the fan of d&b must be in column 1, and the sport corresponding to the fan of soul is badminton (since surfing is already assigned).

Now, let's consider the food options. We know that mango is on either side of the fan of soul. Since the fan of soul is in column 1, mango cannot be in column 2 (otherwise, it would not be next to the fan of soul). Therefore, mango must be eaten by the person who likes surfing.

We can now fill in the final values:

|               |     1     |    2    |
| Food          | avocado   | mango  |
| Music-Genre   | d&b       |         |
| Sport         | badminton | surfing |

Wait, what? We had previously assigned soul to column 1, but now we've replaced it with d&b! This is because the initial assignment was based on incomplete information. Now that we have more information, we can see that the correct assignment is indeed d&b in column 1.

Finally, we know that the music genre corresponding to mango (surfing) must be soul, since it's the only remaining option.

Here is the final solution:

|               |     1     |    2    |
| Food          | avocado   | mango  |
| Music-Genre   | d&b       | soul   |
| Sport         | badminton | surfing |

The final answer is:

Lv3-3x2-2	"After analyzing the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


|               |     1     |      2       |
| Job           | Paramedic | Videographer |
| Nationality   | Nigerian  | German        |
| Transport     | Car       | Quad-bike     |

Let me explain my reasoning:

* From clue 3, we know that the person driving the car is on the left or right of the Nigerian. Since the person driving the car can't be in both positions, it means that the Nigerian must be in position 1 (to be on either side of the car).
* From clue 2, we know that the videographer is on the right of the person driving the car. This means that the videographer must be in position 2.
* Since the videographer is in position 2 and can't drive a car (as per clue 2), it means that the paramedic must be driving the car, which puts them in position 1.
* As we already established that the Nigerian is in position 1, this means that the person driving the car (paramedic) is on the left of the Nigerian.

Now, let's put '#############' around the final solution table:

Lv3-3x2-3	"Let's analyze the clues:

Clue 1: The Chinese is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies.
This means the Chinese cannot be in column 2, and the person watching fantasy movies must be in column 2.

Clue 2: The person who's sport is climbing is on the left or right of the person watching thriller movies.
Since there are only two columns, this means the person who likes climbing must be in column 1 (left) or column 2 (right).

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   |            | Fantasy    |
| Nationality   | Chinese    | Australian |
| Sport         | Climbing   | Ice-Hockey |

Wait, this doesn't satisfy Clue 2! If the person who likes climbing is in column 1, then the person watching thriller movies must be in column 1 as well. But we already have Fantasy in column 2!

Let's try again:

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   | Thriller  | Fantasy    |
| Nationality   | Chinese    | Australian |
| Sport         |            | Ice-Hockey |

Now, we need to put Climbing in either column 1 or column 2. Since it can't be in the same column as Thriller (Clue 2), and it's already on the left of Fantasy (which is incorrect), let's try putting it in the remaining space:

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   | Thriller  | Fantasy    |
| Nationality   | Chinese    | Australian |
| Sport         | Climbing  | Ice-Hockey |

No, that doesn't work. Let's try swapping the Sports:

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   | Thriller  | Fantasy    |
| Nationality   | Chinese    | Australian |
| Sport         | Ice-Hockey| Climbing  |

This looks promising!

Here is the final solution table:

| Movie-Genre   | Satire    | Superhero|
| Nationality   | French    | British  |
| Pet           | Hedgehog | Snake    |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 1, we know the British person is on the left of the person watching satire movies. This means the British person must be in column 2 (since they can't be to the left of themselves). The person watching satire movies must be in column 1.

Clue 3 states that the owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the French. Since the French person is already determined to be in column 1 (because the British person is in column 2), this means the hedgehog's owner must also be in column 1.

The only pet left for the British person is the snake, so we can fill that in.

Lv3-3x2-5	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 2, we know the Brazilian is either to the left or right of the Fisherman. Let's assume the Fisherman is in column 1 for now.

If the Brazilian is to the left of the Fisherman (column 1), then the Australian must be in column 2. But this contradicts the fact that the person drinking lemonade is on the right of the Fisherman (clue 1). Therefore, the Brazilian cannot be in column 1.

So, the Brazilian must be to the right of the Fisherman. This means the Fisherman is in column 1, and the Brazilian is in column 2.

Now, let's apply clue 1: the person drinking lemonade is on the right of the Fisherman. Since the Fisherman is in column 1, the person drinking lemonade must be in column 2.

Here's a possible solution:


|               |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage      |            |           |
| Job           | Fisherman  | Scientist|
| Nationality   | Australian | Brazilian|

But wait! The person drinking water is not yet assigned. Since the lemonade drinker is in column 2, the water drinker must be in column 1.

Now we have:


|               |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage      | Water      | Lemonade  |
| Job           | Fisherman  | Scientist|

This solution satisfies all clues.

Lv3-3x2-6	"Let's analyze the clues:


1. The person drinking Fanta is on the left or right of the fan of Rock.
   This means the fan of Rock cannot be in column 1, because there would be no one to their left.

2. The person whose hobby is photography is on the left of the fan of Rock.
   Since the fan of Rock can only be in column 2 (from clue 1), the photographer must be in column 1.


Now we can start filling out the table:


|               |      1      |   2   |
| Beverage      |             |       |
| Hobby         | Photography |       |
| Music-Genre   |             | Rock  |

The person who likes photography cannot drink Fanta (because of clue 1), so they must drink Tea.


|               |      1      |   2   |
| Beverage      | Tea        |       |
| Hobby         | Photography |       |
| Music-Genre   |             | Rock  |

Now, the person who likes Rock must be on the right of the person who drinks Fanta (from clue 1). So, the fan of Soul must drink Fanta.


|               |      1      |   2   |
| Beverage      | Tea        | Fanta |
| Hobby         | Photography |       |
| Music-Genre   | Soul        | Rock  |

Finally, we know that the person who likes photography is on the left of the fan of Rock. The only hobby left for column 2 is Chess.

Lv3-3x2-7	"Let's break down the clues:


Clue 1: The person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the person driving the tram.
This means that Martial-Arts is in column 2 and Tram is in column 1.


Clue 2: The person driving the ship is on the left or right of the fan of d&b
This means that Ship and D&B are either in the same row or adjacent rows.

Since there are only two options, we can try to fit the remaining genres:


Trance must be paired with Mystery (since Martial-Arts is already paired with Tram)
D&B must be paired with Ship, but not in the same column as Tram

Here's the final solution table:

Lv3-3x2-8	"After analyzing the given conditions, I arrived at the following solution:


|               |       1       |    2    |
| Beverage      | Fanta         | Mirinda |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic          | Satire  |
| Sport         | Skateboarding | Parkour |

Let's break down the reasoning:

* From condition 2, we know that the person who skateboards is on the left or right of the person drinking Mirinda. This implies that Skateboarding and Mirinda cannot be in the same column.
* From condition 1, we know that the person watching Satire movies is to the right of the person whose sport is Skateboarding. Since Skateboarding can't be in the same column as Mirinda (from condition 2), this means Skateboarding must be in column 1 and Satire must be in column 2.
* Now, we have two options for Fanta: it could be paired with Epic or Parkour. However, if Fanta were paired with Parkour, then Mirinda would need to be paired with Skateboarding (since Mirinda can't be paired with Satire). But this would put Skateboarding and Mirinda in the same column, violating condition 2. Therefore, Fanta must be paired with Epic.
* This leaves us with only one possible solution:

Lv3-3x2-9	"Let's analyze the puzzle:

From statement 1, we know that the person watching western movies is on the left of the fan of disco.

From statement 2, we know that the person who's sport is weightlifting is on either side of the fan of disco. This means that the person who's sport is tennis cannot be on both sides of the fan of disco (since there are only two positions), so the person who's sport is tennis must be on the opposite side from western movies.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|               |       1       |   2    |
| Movie-Genre   | Western      | Sports  |
| Music-Genre   |              | Disco   |
| Sport         | Weightlifting| Tennis |

From statement 1, we know that western movies are on the left of disco. From statement 2, we know that weightlifting is on either side of disco, but since it's already on the left of disco in our current table, it must be correct.

Finally, let's fill in the remaining music genre:

| Movie-Genre   | sports   | romance       |
| Sport         | golf     | skateboarding |

Here's my reasoning:

From clue (2), we know that the person eating nectarine is on the right of the person who's sport is golf. This means that the person eating eggplant must be paired with golf, and the person eating nectarine must be paired with either sports or romance.

From clue (1), we know that the person watching romance movies is on the left or right of the person eating nectarine. Since the person eating nectarine can't be on the left of themselves, they must be on the right of someone. But we already know from clue (2) that the person eating nectarine is on the right of the person who's sport is golf. This means that the person watching romance movies must be paired with skateboarding.

Now we have:
