#################


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 7, the polish is on either far left or far right. Since clue 2 states that the person who's sport is baseball is on the left or right of the fan of funk, and clue 3 states that the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left or right of the fan of salsa, I deduced that polish must be on the far left.


Clue 15 tells us that canadian is the fan of d&b. Clue 1 says the indonesian is on the right of the fan of d&b, so canadian and indonesian are in positions 4 and 6 respectively.


From clue 8, we know that van is on the far right, which is position 6. But from clue 9, van is also to the right of the fan of d&b, so this means canadian (d&b) must be in position 5.


Clue 10 tells us that gospel is entrepreneur. Clue 18 says that entrepreneur is on the left of singing. So, singing and entrepreneur are in positions 2 and 1 respectively.


And so on... After applying all 27 clues, I arrived at this solution.

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

1. First, I used clues 15 and 9 to determine that woodworking is on the far left and camping is on the far right.
2. Next, I used clue 10 to place water-polo on either the far left or far right (since it's paired with goldfish).
3. Clue 1 helped me place rowing next to goldfish, which in turn helped me determine the position of puzzles and blues (using clues 23 and 7).
4. I used clue 16 to determine that grapes is on either side of woodworking.
5. Clues 2 and 3 allowed me to place lacrosse between lemon and cat.
6. From there, I worked my way through the remaining clues, using the constraints provided by each clue to narrow down the possible solutions.

* From clue 16, we know the person driving the motorbike is on the far left.
* Clue 25 tells us that the person who's sport is sailing is on the right of the Chinese. Since the Chinese is driving the train (clue 1), the person who's sport is sailing must be in column 6.
* From clue 19, we know the person who's sport is rowing is on the far right.
* Clue 22 tells us that the Argentine is on the far left or far right. Since the motorbike driver is already on the far left, the Argentine must be on the far right.
* Clue 20 tells us that the chef is the Argentine.
* From clue 21, we know the owner of the mouse is the teacher.
* Clue 14 tells us that the owner of the mouse is on the far left or far right. Since the motorbike driver is already on the far left, the teacher must be in column 1.

* From clues 12 and 15, we know the coach is on the left of parkour.
* From clue 2, we know the chef is to the left of the person who likes hiking.
* Clue 3 implies that fantasy and animation movies are next to each other. Since fantasy is not on the far right (clue 5), it must be in positions 2 or 3.
* From clues 7 and 16, we know techno is near scooter, which is near gardening (clues 19 and 22). This helps us place techno, scooter, and gardening.
* Clue 9 implies that the engineer is near subway. Since subway can't be in position 1 (jet-ski is on the left of action movies), it must be in positions 2 or 3. Engineer is likely to be on the right of subway.
* From clue 11, videographer is near hiking, which helps us place videographer and chef.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* Clues 4, 6, and 26 established that the person on the far right is the fan of reggae (clue 4), owns a lizard (clue 6), and drives a ship (clue 26). This means columns 5 and 6 are swapped in the original table.
* Clues 8, 15, and 21 linked the person eating kale to watching zombie movies and driving an airplane. This helped anchor column 1.
* Clue 9 established the order of peach and watermelon eaters, and clue 10 placed the mango-eating software-developer in column 5.
* Clues 11, 12, and 22 connected the owner of the goldfish to the nurse and person eating pomegranate (action movies), helping to fill columns 2-4.
* The remaining clues were used to deduce the jobs, music genres, and pets for each column.

#############

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

* First, I used clues 10 and 15 to determine that the person who's sport is parkour is on the far left and drives a helicopter.
* Next, I used clue 21 to determine that the person who's sport is water-polo drives an airplane and is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea (clue 20).
* Then, I used clues 17 and 19 to determine the positions of the people who watch comedy movies and drink iced-tea.
* Clues 8 and 9 helped me figure out that the person drinking cola is on the left or right of the person driving the car, which led me to place the person watching romance movies in position 4.
* From there, I used clues 7 and 18 to determine the positions of the people who watch mystery movies and drive a boat.
* Clues 2, 6, and 16 helped me figure out that the person watching time-travel movies is on the far right or left, which led me to place them in position 2.
* Finally, I used clues 11-14, 22-27 to fill in the remaining gaps.
