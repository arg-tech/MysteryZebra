Lv3-2x3-1	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |     1     |     2      |     3      |
| Movie-Genre   | Adventure | Mystery    | Scientific|
| Transport     | Subway    | Taxi       | Snowmobile|

#############


Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 4, we know that the person driving the subway is on the far left. From clue 1, we also know that this person watches adventure movies.

Clue 2 tells us that the person driving the taxi is to the right of the person driving the subway. This means the taxi driver must be in either column 2 or 3. Since the subway driver is watching adventure movies (column 1), and there are only three genres, the mystery movie watcher cannot be on the far left.

From clue 3, we know that the taxi driver is to the left or right of the person watching mystery movies. This means the mystery movie watcher must be in column 2, with the taxi driver in either column 1 or 3. However, since the subway driver (adventure) is already on the far left (column 1), and the taxi driver cannot also be in column 1, we conclude that the taxi driver must be in column 2 or 3.

Combining these insights, we can now place the mystery movie watcher in column 2 and the taxi driver in column 2 as well. This leaves only one option for the scientific movie watcher: column 3.

Since the snowmobile is the only remaining transportation option, it must be associated with the scientific movie watcher in column 3.

And that's how we arrived at the final solution!"	{'movie-genre': ['adventure', 'mystery', 'scientific'], 'transport': ['subway', 'taxi', 'snowmobile']}	True	4	False

Here's how the clues led me to this solution:

* From clue 1, we know that golf is on the left of handball.
* Clue 2 tells us that the pilot is on the left of the fisherman. This means the pilot must be in column 1 or 2. Since golf is also on the far left (from clue 3), it's likely that golf and the pilot are in column 1.
* Clue 4 says the librarian plays ice-hockey, which helps us fill in the sport for column 3.
* Now we have: Pilot (column 1) -> ? -> Librarian (column 3).
* The only job left is fisherman. From clue 2, we know the pilot is on the left of the fisherman, so the fisherman must be in column 2.

The final table should look like this:

From clue 2, we know that the accountant is on the far right, so:

From clue 4, we know that the fan of R&B is to the right of the fan of techno. Since the accountant is already on the far right, the fan of techno must be in the middle:


|               |      1       |     2     |     3      |

| Music-Genre   |              | Techno    |            |

From clue 3, we know that the paramedic is a fan of techno. So, the paramedic must be in the middle:


|               |      1       |     2     |     3      |

From clue 4, we know that the fan of R&B is to the right of the fan of techno. Therefore, the fan of R&B must be in position 3:


|               |      1       |     2     |     3      |

The only job left is videographer, which must be in position 1. The only music genre left is blues, which must also be in position 1:

Here's how it works out:

* The person who's hobby is video-games is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing (Clue 1).
* Since the owner of the fish is between the person who's hobby is video-games and the owner of the mouse (Clue 3), and considering Clue 2, we can deduce that the person with video-games is on the left.
* If the person with video-games were in column 1 and the owner of the fish were in column 2, then the owner of the mouse would have to be in column 3. But this means there's no one left for the fishing hobby!
* Therefore, the only option is that the person with video-games is in column 1, the owner of the fish (and also someone who has a hobby) is in column 2, and the owner of the mouse (who also does fishing) is in column 3.

| Transport     |          |        |        |

 

Puzzle:


The people perfer 3 different movie-genres: action, disaster, family
The people use 3 different means of transport: ship, subway, taxi


1. the person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person watching action movies##3
2. the person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the ship
3. the person driving the taxi is on the right of the person watching action movies
4. the person watching action movies is between the person watching disaster movies and the person driving the taxi##2


Let's break it down step by step:


From statement 1, we know the person driving the taxi is next to the person watching action movies.


Statement 3 tells us that the person driving the taxi is on the right of the person watching action movies. Combining this with statement 4, we get:


disaster - action - taxi


Now, from statement 2, we know the person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the ship.


We can combine all the information to get:


subway - disaster - action - taxi - ship isn't possible because the ship must be after the subway


So, the correct order for transport is:


disaster - subway - family doesn't fit so it has to be:  family - ship isn't possible because the person watching action movies is between the person watching disaster movies and the person driving the taxi. So, this has to be: subway - family - ship doesn't fit


subway - disaster isn't possible, so it must be:


family - subway - disaster


And for movie-genre we already had:


disaster - action - 


So the complete table is:

Lv3-2x3-6	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 1, we know the lawyer is to the left of the accountant.

From clue 2, we know the chess player is to the right of the baker.

From clue 3, we know the traveler is either to the left or right of the baker.

From clue 4, we know the baker is to the right of the engineer.

Now, let's start filling in the table:

Since the lawyer is to the left of the accountant (clue 1), and there are only three columns, the lawyer must be in column 1. Let's put them in their respective jobs:

|         |     1     |   2    |     3      |
| Hobby   |           |        |            |
| Job     | Lawyer    | Accountant |            |

Now, let's place the engineer and baker (clue 4). The baker must be to the right of the engineer, so:

|         |     1     |   2    |     3      |
| Hobby   |           |        |            |
| Job     | Lawyer    | Engineer | Accountant |

Now, let's place the hobbies. From clue 2, we know the chess player is to the right of the baker. Since the baker is in column 3, and there's only one person left to be placed (the traveler), the chess player must be in column 2 or 3. But since the baker is already in column 3, the chess player must be in column 2.

From clue 3, we know the traveler is either to the left or right of the baker. Since the baker is in column 3, and there's only one person left to be placed (the traveler), the traveler must be in column 1 or 2. But since the lawyer is already in column 1, the traveler must be in column 1.

Now we have:

Now, let's fill in the nationalities based on the clues:


Since the Malaysian is on the left of the fan of funk (clue 2), and funk is at position 1, we can deduce that the Malaysian is actually at position 1.


|               |   1   |     2     |     3      |
| Music-Genre   | funk  |    rock   |   techno  |
| Nationality   | malaysian |           |            |

From clue 1, we know that the fan of techno is on the right of the Dutch. Since techno is at position 3, the Dutch must be at either position 1 or 2. However, position 1 is already occupied by the Malaysian, so the Dutch must be at position 2.


|               |   1   |     2     |     3      |
| Music-Genre   | funk  |    rock   |   techno  |
| Nationality   | malaysian | dutch |            |

Finally, from clue 3, we know that the Malaysian is on the left or right of the fan of rock. Since the Malaysian is at position 1 and the fan of rock is at position 2, this condition is already satisfied.


The Australian must be at position 3, as it's the only nationality left.

| Beverage   |  Milk       | Fanta  | Cola   |

Here's how I deduced the solution:

* From clue 4, we know that the person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person eating grapes.
* Clue 1 tells us that the person drinking cola eats grapes. Combining this with clue 4, we can conclude that the person drinking cola must be in position 3 (since they eat grapes and fanta is to their left).
* Clue 2 states that the person eating orange is in the middle, so they must be in position 2.
* Clue 3 tells us that the person drinking milk is on the left of the person drinking fanta. This means that the person drinking milk must be in position 1 (since fanta can't be on the left of themselves).
* With cola in position 3 and orange in position 2, we know that grapes must also be in position 3 (thanks to clue 1). And since pomegranate is the only food option left, it must be paired with milk.

Therefore, the final solution table is:

| Job           | Fisherman | Nurse | Teacher |
| Music-Genre   | R&B       | Disco | Techno  |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 3, we know the nurse is on the right of the fan of techno. This means the nurse can't be in position 1, since there would be no one to their left.

From clue 2, we know the fan of disco is on the left of the teacher. Since the nurse is already ruled out for position 1 (by clue 3), this means the fan of disco must be in either position 1 or 2.

Now, let's consider the fisherman. From clue 1, we know they are on the left or right of the nurse. Given the possibilities for the nurse (positions 2 and 3), the fisherman can't be in position 2, since that would mean there is no one to their right who could be a nurse.

Putting it all together:

* The fan of disco must be in either position 1 or 2.
* The nurse must be on the right of the fan of techno (clue 3).
* Given these constraints, we can deduce that:
	+ Position 1: Fisherman is not possible (by clue 1), so it must be the fan of R&B, which makes the fisherman available for position 2.
	+ Position 2: Can't be disco (clue 2) or techno (since nurse needs to be on their right). Therefore, this must be the nurse's position.
	+ Position 3: Teacher is now possible (by clue 2), and techno fits well here.

So, our solution becomes:
