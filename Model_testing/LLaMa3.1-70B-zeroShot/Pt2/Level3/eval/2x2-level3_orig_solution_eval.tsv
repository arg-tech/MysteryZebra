Lv3-2x2-1	"Based on the given conditions:


Since the person drinking tea is on the left or right of the person drinking juice (condition 1), and there are only two columns, we can conclude that the person drinking tea must be in column 1 and the person drinking juice must be in column 2.


Now, considering condition 2, which states that the person eating lemon is on the right of the person drinking tea, we know that the person drinking tea (in column 1) cannot eat lemon. Therefore, the person drinking tea must eat kiwi.


Since the person drinking juice (in column 2) does not drink tea, and there are only two types of food, they must eat lemon.


Here is the final solution table:


#############
|            |  1   |   2   |
| Beverage   | Tea  | Juice |
| Food       | Kiwi | Lemon |

Lv3-2x2-2	"Let's analyze the clues:


Clue 1: The person who surfs is on the left or right of the person drinking water.
This means that surfing cannot be in column 2, since there would be no one to their left.

Clue 2: The person drinking water is on the far right.
So, the person drinking water must be in column 2.


Now, let's fill out the table:


|            |      1      |   2   |
| Beverage   | almond-milk | water |
| Sport      | surfing     | golf  |

Lv3-2x2-3	"Let's break down the clues:


Clue 1: The French is on the left of the person watching Western movies.
This means that if we represent the positions as follows:
|   ?    |    ?     |
We can deduce that:


French cannot be in position 2, since there is no one to their right. Therefore, French must be in position 1.


Clue 3 (which seems to be a repeat of Clue 1): The French is on the left or right of the person watching Western movies.
This clue doesn't add any new information.


Now, let's fill in the table with what we know:


|               |   1    |    2     |
| Movie-Genre   |        |          |
| Nationality   | French |          |

Since there are only two nationalities (French and Nigerian) and the French is already in position 1, the person in position 2 must be Nigerian.


Now, we need to fill in the movie genres. We know that:


* There are two different movie-genres: sports and western.
* The French is on the left of the person watching Western movies.

This implies that the person watching Western movies is in position 2 (Nigerian). Therefore:


|               |   1    |    2     |
| Movie-Genre   | Sports | Western  |
| Nationality   | French | Nigerian |

So, the final solution table is:


#############

| Movie-Genre   | Sports | Western  |
| Nationality   | French | Nigerian |

Lv3-2x2-4	"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The person eating apricot is on the right of the person drinking Sprite.
This means that the person drinking Sprite must be in column 1, and the person eating apricot must be in column 2.

2. The person drinking Fanta is on the far left or far right.
Since the person drinking Sprite is already in column 1 (far left), the person drinking Fanta must be in column 2 (far right).

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|            |   1    |    2    |
| Beverage   | Sprite | Fanta  |
| Food       |        | Apricot|
#############

But wait! We still have one food item left: Tomato. Since apricot is already paired with Fanta, tomato must be paired with Sprite.

Here's the final solution:

#############
|            |   1    |    2    |
| Beverage   | Sprite | Fanta  |
| Food       | Tomato | Apricot|

Lv3-2x2-5	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The Australian is on the right of the fan of salsa.
This means that salsa cannot be in column 2 (since there would be no space for the Australian to be on its right). Therefore, salsa must be in column 1.

2. The fan of salsa is on the left or right of the fan of ambient.
Since salsa is already determined to be in column 1, this means that ambient must be in column 2 (because salsa cannot be on the left of anything).

Now we know the music-genres:

|               |    1     |     2      |
| Music-Genre   |  salsa  |  ambient  |

From clue 1, we also know that the Australian is on the right of salsa. Therefore:

|               |    1     |     2      |
| Nationality   | american | australian |

Here's the completed table with '#############' around it:

Lv3-2x2-6	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The fan of ambient music is on the left or right of the Mexican.
This means that Ambient and Mexican cannot be in the same column.

2. The Mexican is on the right of the Malaysian.
This means that Malaysian must be in column 1, and Mexican must be in column 2.


So, the table should look like this:


#############
|               |     1     |    2    |
| Music-Genre   |           |         |
| Nationality   |           |         |
#############

Let's fill in the blanks:

* Malaysian is in column 1, so Mexican is in column 2.
* Since Ambient cannot be with Mexican (clue 1), and Malaysian is already in column 1, Ambient must be paired with Malaysian.
* The only music genre left for the Mexican is d&b.

The final solution table is:


#############
|               |     1     |    2    |
| Music-Genre   |  Ambient  |  d&b    |

Lv3-2x2-7	"Let's analyze the clues:


1. The Thai is on the left or right of the Malaysian.
This means that the Malaysian and Thai cannot be in the same column, but they must be in adjacent columns.


2. The owner of the snake is on the left of the Thai.
This means that the snake's owner must be in column 1.


Considering these clues, we can try to fill in the table:


|               |     1     |  2   |
| Nationality   |           |      |
| Pet           |           |      |

Since the snake's owner is on the left of the Thai, and the Malaysian cannot be in the same column as the Thai, the only possible arrangement is:

|               |     1     |  2   |
| Nationality   | Malaysian | Thai |
| Pet           | Snake     | Cat  |

Wait, this doesn't work! The clue states that the owner of the snake is on the left of the Thai, but in this arrangement, the snake's owner (Malaysian) is not next to the Thai.


Let's try again:


|               |     1     |  2   |
| Nationality   |           |      |
| Pet           |           |      |

This time, let's place the Thai on the left and the Malaysian on the right. Since the owner of the snake is on the left of the Thai, the snake must belong to the Thai:


|               |     1     |  2   |
| Nationality   | Thai    | Malaysian |
| Pet           | Snake  | Cat      |

This arrangement satisfies both clues!

Lv3-2x2-8	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the person who's hobby is singing.
This means that Woodworking must be in column 1, and Singing must be in column 2.

| Food       |          | Avocado |

2. The person drinking coffee is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea.
Since iced-tea is in column 1, coffee must be in either column 1 (which is not possible since there's only one beverage per column) or column 2.

| Beverage   | Iced-Tea | Coffee  |

Lv3-2x2-10	"Based on the given clues, I will solve the puzzle and present the solution in a table format.


Clue 1: The person driving the van is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike.
This means that the two transport options cannot be in the same column (i.e., one above the other).

Clue 2: The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the person watching comedy movies.
Since there are only two columns, this implies that the person watching musical movies must be on the right, and the person watching comedy movies must be on the left. Also, since the person driving the quad-bike is to the left of the person watching comedy movies, it means the person driving the quad-bike must be in column 1.

Considering these clues, we can construct the solution table:
