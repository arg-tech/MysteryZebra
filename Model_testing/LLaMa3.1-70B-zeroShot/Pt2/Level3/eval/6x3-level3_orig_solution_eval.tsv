From clue 3, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the far right.

From clue 1, we know that the indian is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies.


From clue 10, we know that the musician is on the far right. Combining this with clue 3, we can conclude that the musician's sport is skateboarding.


From clue 5, we know that the person who's sport is tennis is the person eating orange.

From clue 2, we know that the person eating orange is on the far left or far right. Since the far right is already occupied by the musician (and skateboarder), the person eating orange must be on the far left.


Now we can start filling in the table:


|               |       1       |       2       |       3       |
| Food          |  orange      |              |               |
| Job           |              |               | musician     |
| Movie-Genre   |              |               |               |
| Music-Genre   |              |               |               |
| Nationality   |              |               |               |
| Sport         |  tennis      |               | skateboarding|

From clue 4, we know that the person watching comedy movies is on the right of the british. This means that the british cannot be on the far left (since there's no one to their left). Therefore, the british must be in the middle.


We also know from clue 6 that the person who's sport is weightlifting is the person watching comedy movies.

From clue 9, we know that the fan of funk is on the right of the mechanic. Since the musician is already on the far right, the fan of funk cannot be the musician. Therefore, the fan of funk must be in the middle or on the far left.


Now we can update the table:


|               |       1       |       2       |       3       |

| Sport         |  tennis      | weightlifting| skateboarding|

From clue 7, we know that the fan of classical is on the right of the person watching drama movies.

We also know from clue 1 that the indian is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies.


Since the middle column already has a job (mechanic) and a nationality (british), the indian must be on the far left.


Now we can update the table:


|               |       1       |       2       |       3       |

| Sport         |  tennis      | weightlifting| skateboarding|

From clue 8, we know that the person eating cucumber is on the right of the person eating cauliflower. This means that the person eating cauliflower must be on the far left.


Now we can update the table:


|               |       1       |       2       |       3       |
| Food          | cauliflower  |              | orange      |
| Job           |              | mechanic     | musician     |
| Movie-Genre   | drama        | comedy      |               |
| Music-Genre   | funk         | classical    |               |
| Nationality   | indian       | british     |               |
| Sport         |  tennis      | weightlifting| skateboarding|

The only food left is cucumber, which must be in the middle column.


Now we can update the table:

| Nationality   | indian       | british     |               |
| Sport         |  tennis      | weightlifting| skateboarding|

The only job left is videographer, which must be on the far left.


Now we can update the table:

| Nationality   | indian       | british     | russian     |
| Sport         |  tennis      | weightlifting| skateboarding|

The only movie-genre left is martial-arts, which must be on the far right.


Now we can update the table:


|               |       1       |       2       |       3       |

Lv3-6x3-2	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a possible solution:

#############


Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 10, we know the videographer is on the far left. From clue 4, the person drinking water is in the middle, so the videographer must be in column 1.

Clue 9 states that the person drinking juice owns a horse. Clue 1 says the owner of the horse is to the left of the person who's hobby is reading. Since the person drinking juice is on the far right (clue 4), this means the person whose hobby is reading must be in column 2.

Clue 8 states that the person whose hobby is reading is to the left of the person whose hobby is baking, so the baker must be in column 3. Clue 7 says the person eating an apple is on either side of the fan of disco, and since the baker can't be a fan of disco (clue 8), this means the fan of disco must be in column 3.

Clue 6 states that the entrepreneur is between the fan of jazz and the person eating papaya. Clue 2 says the owner of the bird is on either side of the person drinking juice, so the owner of the bird can't be the entrepreneur (clue 9). This means the fan of jazz must be in column 1.

Clue 5 states that the videographer and analyst are on either side of the person drinking water. Clue 3 says the fan of disco is to the right of the person eating papaya, so this means the person eating papaya must be in column 2.

With all these constraints, we can start filling in the table:

* Column 1: videographer (clue 10), jazz (deduced), frog (only pet left)
* Column 2: water (clue 4), reading (clue 1), papaya (clue 6), horse (clue 9)
* Column 3: almond-milk, baking (clue 8), apple (clue 7), disco (clue 3), bird (only pet left)

The entrepreneur must be in column 2 (clue 6). The analyst can't be on the far right (clue 9), so it must be in column 3.

Finally, we can fill in the remaining beverages and food:


* Column 1: videographer, jazz, cherry (only food left), frog
* Column 2: water, reading, papaya, horse, entrepreneur
* Column 3: almond-milk, baking, apple, disco, bird, analyst

This solution satisfies all the clues."	{'beverage': ['water', 'almond-milk', 'juice'], 'food': ['cherry', 'papaya', 'apple'], 'hobby': ['collecting', 'reading', 'baking'], 'job': ['videographer', 'entrepreneur', 'analyst'], 'music-genre': ['jazz', 'classical', 'disco'], 'pet': ['frog', 'horse', 'bird']}	True	7	False
Lv3-6x3-3	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |      1      |    2     |      3       |

| Sport         | snowboarding| tennis   | skiing      |
#############


Here's how the solution was derived:

From clue 6, we know that the person who's hobby is board-games is on the far left. This means that column 1 has ""board-games"" as its hobby.

From clue 5, we know that the owner of the hamster is the person watching comedy movies. Since the person with the hobby ""camping"" also watches comedy movies (clue 1), and the person who's hobby is board-games is on the far left, the owner of the hamster must be in column 2.

From clue 2, we know that the owner of the bird is on the left or right of the fan of reggae. Since the owner of the hamster (in column 2) watches comedy movies and cannot be on the left of the fan of reggae, the owner of the bird must be in column 3.

From clue 8, we know that the person eating lemon is on the right of the owner of the bird. This means that column 3 has ""lemon"" as its food.

From clue 7, we know that the person eating pepper is on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since column 1 cannot be to the left of column 2, and column 3 already has lemon as its food, column 3 must have ""snowboarding"" as its sport. This means that column 2 has ""pepper"" as its food.

From clue 4, we know that the fan of jazz is on the left of the person watching thriller movies. Since the person in column 2 watches comedy movies and cannot be to the left of the person watching thriller movies, the fan of jazz must be in column 3. However, this contradicts with the fact that the owner of the bird (in column 3) is on the right or left of the fan of reggae. Therefore, the fan of jazz must be in column 1.

From clue 3, we know that the person who's sport is tennis is between the person who's sport is snowboarding and the person eating artichoke. Since column 2 has ""pepper"" as its food and column 3 has ""snowboarding"" as its sport, the person eating artichoke must be in column 1.

Finally, from clue 4, we know that the fan of jazz (in column 1) is on the left of the person watching thriller movies. This means that column 2 has ""mystery"" or ""comedy"" as its movie-genre, but since the owner of the hamster (in column 2) watches comedy movies, column 3 must have ""thriller"" as its movie-genre.

The rest of the information can be filled in accordingly."	{'food': ['artichoke', 'lemon', 'pepper'], 'hobby': ['board-games', 'camping', 'puzzles'], 'movie-genre': ['thriller', 'comedy', 'mystery'], 'music-genre': ['techno', 'reggae', 'jazz'], 'pet': ['hamster', 'bird', 'guinea-pig'], 'sport': ['snowboarding', 'tennis', 'skiing']}	True	4	False

#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 4, the person drinking juice is on the far right (column 3).
* From clue 11, the Brazilian is driving the subway, which must be in column 2.
* From clue 12, the teacher is on the far left or far right. Given that the Brazilian is already in column 2, the teacher must be in column 1.
* From clue 10, the software-developer is to the right of the person driving the train, which means the train must be in column 1 (driven by the teacher).
* From clue 9, the Turkish person is between the software-developer and the teacher. Since the teacher is in column 1, the Turkish person must be in column 1 as well.
* From clue 3, the person drinking fanta has puzzles as their hobby. This person cannot be on the far left (column 1), so they must be in column 2 or 3. Given that the Brazilian is already in column 2, the person with puzzles as their hobby must be in column 2.
* From clue 5, the person drinking almond-milk is next to the person who has puzzles as their hobby. This means the person drinking almond-milk must be in either column 1 or 3. Since the teacher is already in column 1, the person drinking almond-milk must be in column 3.
* From clue 8, the fan of classical music is between the person with puzzles as their hobby and the person who has traveling as their hobby. This means the person with classical music must be in column 2 (between columns 1 and 3).
* From clue 6, the person with video-games as their hobby is to the left of the person driving the boat. Given that the metal fan is driving the boat (clue 7), this person must be in column 3.
* Finally, from clue 2, the Egyptian person is on either side of the train driver (column 1). Since the Turkish person is already in column 1, the Egyptian person must be in column 2.

4. & 7. The person who's hobby is skydiving (American) is on the left or right of the person driving the subway and also on the left of the person drinking fanta (British).
5. The person who's hobby is skydiving (American) drinks tea.
6. The fan of hip-hop (Italian) is on the left of the Italian is not a direct clue, but it implies that the fan of hip-hop must be in column 1 or 2. Since the American is already using the subway, the Italian must be in column 3 and the fan of hip-hop must be in column 2.
8. The Italian (in column 1) is on the left of the person drinking water (British).
9. The fan of soul music (Italian) is indeed a police-officer.
10. The person who's hobby is baking (Italian) is on the left of the person driving the bus.

Lv3-6x3-7	"After analyzing the clues, I've solved the logic puzzle for you. Here's the final solution:


|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |
| Food          | banana   | blueberry | nectarine |
| Movie-Genre   | romance   | sports    | action    |
| Music-Genre   | gospel    | d&b       | hip-hop   |
| Nationality   | colombian | american  | nigerian  |
| Pet           | bird      | rat        | turtle    |
| Transport     | airplane  | bus        | jet-ski   |

Here's how I solved it:

From clue 8, we know the person driving the airplane is on the right of the owner of the rat. From clue 2, we know the owner of the rat eats nectarine.

Clue 3 tells us that the person watching sports movies is on the right of the person driving the airplane. Clue 5 says the american is on the left or right of the person driving the airplane, and since the person watching sports movies can't be in position 1 (due to clue 8), the american must be in position 2.

Now, from clue 4, we know the owner of the turtle is on the far right. From clue 9, the american is on the left or right of the nigerian, so the colombian must be in position 1.

Clue 7 tells us that the owner of the rat is on the left or right of the person eating blueberry, which means the rat's owner can't be in position 3 (since there's no one to their right). The only remaining spot for the rat's owner is position 2. Since the airplane driver is to the right of the rat's owner (clue 8), the airplane must be in position 1.

With these positions fixed, we can use the remaining clues to fill in the rest:

From clue 6, the fan of d&b is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski. The only spot left for the jet-ski driver is position 2 (since the airplane is already taken). This means the fan of d&b must be in position 3.

Clue 1 tells us that the fan of hip-hop watches action movies, and since they can't be in positions 1 or 2 (already occupied), they must be in position 3.

Finally, we're left with only one spot for the romance movie fan: position 1.

Lv3-6x3-9	"Based on the given clues, I'll fill in the table with the correct information.


|               |        1        |       2       |     3     |
| Beverage      | almond-milk    | 7up           | hot-chocolate|
| Job           | freelancer     | librarian     | project-manager|
| Movie-Genre   | mystery        | crime         | superhero     |
| Music-Genre   | gospel         | salsa         | reggae       |
| Nationality   | thai           | polish        | italian      |
| Sport         | snowboarding   | lacrosse      | badminton    |

Here's the explanation for each step:

1. From clue 6, we know the Italian is the project-manager. Since there are only three options for nationality and job, this limits our choices.
2. Clue 2 states that the person drinking 7up is the librarian. We can place them in column 2 (middle).
3. Clue 1 says the project-manager is on the far left or right. Given the Italian-project manager connection from clue 6, we'll put the project-manager in column 3.
4. From clues 9 and 11, we know the fan of gospel watches mystery movies. Since they can't be in column 2 (occupied by the librarian), we place them in column 1.
5. Clue 8 says the fan of gospel is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. This means the hot-chocolate drinker must be in column 3 (project-manager).
6. From clue 4, the salsa fan is Polish. Since they can't be in column 1 (occupied by the gospel fan) and the Italian-project manager is in column 3, we place the salsa-Polish combination in column 2.
7. Clue 10 says the freelancer is to the right of snowboarding. This puts the freelancer-snowboarder combination in columns 1 and 2, but since the gospel fan is already in column 1, we swap them: freelancer goes to column 1 (but that's incorrect), so they go to column 3 - no, snowboarding must be in column 1.
8. Clue 7 states that the crime movie watcher is on the right of almond-milk. Given the current configuration, this places the crime movie fan in column 2 or 3. However, since clue 5 says they're also near the Italian (column 3), we place them in column 2.
9. The remaining options can be filled: badminton for sport and reggae music-genre in column 1; lacrosse is already paired with gospel.

The final solution table is:
