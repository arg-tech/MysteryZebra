Lv3-1x7-1	"Let's analyze the clues:


From clue 1 and clue 3, we can conclude that the person drinking cola is on the right of the person drinking juice.

From clue 5, we know that the person drinking juice is on the left of the person drinking cola.


Now, let's combine these two: Juice - Cola


Clue 2 tells us that milk is next to juice. Since clue 3 already places cola to the right of juice, milk must be to the left of juice:


Milk - Juice - Cola


We also know from clue 4 and clue 7 that either 7up or milk can be on the far left or far right. Given that we've already placed milk next to juice, and it's possible for 7up to be next to another drink (iced-tea), let's place 7up on the far right:


Milk - Juice - Cola ?? ?? ?? 7up


From clue 6, lemonade is to the right of sprite. We also know that there are three remaining drinks: lemonade, sprite, and iced-tea.


Since 7up must be next to iced-tea (clue 8), let's place iced-tea before 7up:


Milk - Juice - Cola ?? ?? Iced-Tea 7up


Now, the only remaining positions are for lemonade and sprite. We can use clue 6 to determine their order:


Milk - Juice - Cola Sprite Lemonade Iced-Tea 7up

This solution satisfies all the clues.

Here's how the clues fit:


* The pilot is on the far right (Clue 4).
* The chef is on the right of the photographer, and since the pilot is on the far right, the chef must be in position 6 (Clues 3 and 4).
* The electrician is on the left of the photographer, so it's in position 4 (Clue 6).
* The designer is between the videographer and the dressmaker (Clue 8), and since the videographer can't be on the far right or left, the designer must be in position 2.
* The videographer is on the left or right of the electrician, so it's in position 3 (Clues 5 and the placement of electrician).
* The dressmaker takes the only remaining spot on the left (position 1).

| Nationality   | turkish  | australian| canadian  | indian     | american | colombian| argentine|
# #############

Explanation:

From clue 1, the Argentine is on either end.
From clue 2 and 3, we know the order of American, Colombian, and Argentine must be: A _ C or C _ A (where ""A"" represents Argentine).
Considering clue 4, which says the American is next to the Argentine, this eliminates the possibility of C _ A, so it's A _ C.
From clue 5 and 6, Turkish is to the left of Indian, and between Australian and Indian. So, we have: T ? I (where ""?"" represents either Australian or another nationality).
Clue 6 indicates that Australian must be on one side of Turkish, thus: A T ? I.
Since the Argentine cannot be in position 2 due to clue 1 (it has to be at an end), and clue 7 suggests Indian is next to Canadian, but doesn't specify sides or order relative to other nationalities yet. However, since A _ C must include American between them for a total of three positions but can only occupy the last three spots because Argentine is on one end (due to clue 1), we now know that these are in positions 5-7.
Considering all other clues and knowing positions 5-7 are taken by American, Colombian, and Argentine in some order with Argentine at one end and A _ C confirmed: 
Turkish must be in position 1 because it's the only way to satisfy clue 6 without interfering with the other conditions for positions 5-7.
Therefore, we get Australian next to Turkish (in position 2) as there are no restrictions that would prevent this given our fixed A T ? I sequence from earlier and knowing Indian is after Turkish but doesn't have to be directly after it due to clue 6 allowing another nationality between them which has been confirmed to be Australian.
Lastly, with all other nationalities assigned according to their clues without contradiction, Canadian and Indian's positions are flexible within the context of their own rule (clue 7) as long as they are next to each other. Since position 3 is open and directly follows Australian, it makes sense for this sequence to follow naturally after Turkish and Australian, placing Canadian in position 3 with Indian following directly after.
The table now looks like this:

Lv3-1x7-4	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |  1  |   2    |    3    |  4  |   5   |    6    |    7    |

|               | R&B | Indie  | Hip-Hop | Pop | Country| Reggae  | Dubstep |
#############

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 2, we know that the fan of pop is on the right of the fan of country. Clue 6 states that the fan of pop is in the middle, so the fan of country must be to the left of the fan of pop.

Clue 1 and clue 5 seem contradictory at first, but they actually imply that the fan of hip-hop is both on the left and right of the fan of indie. This can only happen if the fan of indie is in position 2 and the fan of hip-hop is in position 3.

From clue 4, we know that the fan of reggae is on the right of the fan of r&b. Clue 7 states that the fan of country is on the left or right of the fan of reggae. Given the existing positions of the fans, the only possibility is for the fan of r&b to be in position 1 and the fan of reggae to be in position 6.

Finally, clue 3 states that the fan of hip-hop is on the left of the fan of dubstep. This means that the fan of dubstep must be in position 7.

Putting it all together, we get the above solution table."	{'music-genre': ['', '', '', '', '', '', '']}	True	0	False
Lv3-1x7-5	"Based on the given clues, I will solve the puzzle and fill in the table.

From clue 2, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is in the middle, which means it must be at position 4.

From clue 5, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is on the left of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Therefore, the person with the hobby rock-climbing must be at position 5 or 6.

From clue 3, we know that the person who's hobby is fishing is between the person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the person who's hobby is dancing. This means that the person with the hobby dancing cannot be at position 1, since fishing would not have enough space to fit between rock-climbing and dancing.

From clue 6, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography. Therefore, the person with the hobby photography must be at position 3 or earlier.

Let's put together what we have so far:

| Hobby   |    1    |     2      |      3      |    4    |       5       |    6    |    7    |

From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. This means that puzzles cannot be at position 6 or 7.

Since photography must be on the left or right of filmmaking (clue 4), and writing is already at position 4, we can conclude that photography is at position 3 and filmmaking is at position 5:

| Hobby   |    1    |     2      |  photography |  writing |  filmmaking |         |         |

Now we know that rock-climbing must be at position 6 (since fishing is between rock-climbing and dancing, and there's not enough space for them if rock-climbing were at position 5).

From clue 3, we can now conclude that the person with the hobby dancing is at position 7:

| Hobby   |    1    |     2      |  photography |  writing |  filmmaking | rock-climbing | dancing |

Finally, we have enough space to fit fishing between rock-climbing and dancing. Therefore, puzzles must be at position 1 or 2.

Since all other hobbies are taken, the person with the hobby puzzles must be at position 1:

| Hobby   |    1    |     2      |      3      |    4    |       5       |    6    |    7    |
|         | puzzles |            | photography |  writing |  filmmaking | rock-climbing | dancing |

The only remaining hobby is fishing. It must be at position 2:

| Hobby   |    1    |     2      |      3      |    4    |       5       |    6    |    7    |

Lv3-1x7-6	"Let's break down the clues:

From clue 4, the fan of disco is on the far left or far right.
From clue 5, the fan of disco is on the left of the fan of trance.

So, the possible positions for disco and trance are:
- Disco (1) - Trance (?)
- ? - Trance (?) - Disco (7)

From clue 2, the fan of soul is on the left or right of the fan of gospel.
Let's assume soul is on the left of gospel for now.

From clue 6, the fan of d&b is between the fan of soul and the fan of metal.
Since d&b is in the middle (clue 3), it must be at position 4. 
So, soul must be on one side of d&b, and metal must be on the other.

Now we have:
- ? - ? - Soul (?) - D&B (4) - Metal (?) - ? - ?

From clue 1, the fan of metal is on the right of the fan of trance.
Since disco is already on the left of trance, it's more likely that the arrangement with disco at position 1 and trance at a lower position will work.

So, we have:
- Disco (1) - ? - Soul (?) - D&B (4) - Trance (?) - Metal (?) - ?

From clue 2, gospel is next to soul.
Let's try to fit in gospel:

- Disco (1) - Gospel (2) - Soul (3) - D&B (4) - Trance (5) - Metal (6) - ?

Now we have only one spot left for reggae.

Lv3-1x7-7	"Let's break down the clues:

1. Metal fan is to the left of Funk fan.
2. D&B fan is in the middle, which means they are in position 4 (since there are 7 positions).
3. Classical fan is to the right of Reggae fan.
4. Dubstep fan is to the right of Classical fan, but clue 5 says Classical fan is also to the left of Dubstep fan, so these two must be together with Classical on the left and Dubstep on the right.
5. This clue reinforces what we deduced from clues 3 and 4.
6. Funk fan is next to D&B fan.

Given that D&B is in position 4, and considering all other clues:

- Metal has to be on the left of Funk (clue 1), so they can't be on positions 5 or 6 because D&B (position 4) would then separate them.
- Classical and Dubstep are together (from clues 3, 4, and 5).
- Reggae must come before Classical (clue 3).

Considering the order Metal - Funk with D&B in the middle and combining all other information:

1. If we place Metal on position 1, then Funk can't be next to it without separating them from being on opposite sides of D&B when considering clue 6.
2. Given Reggae must come before Classical (clue 3) and Classical-Dubstep are together, they form a block.
3. Since Classical-Dubstep has to follow Reggae and be in the second half (because Metal and Funk need space on either side of D&B), we place them after considering positions for Metal-Funk around D&B.

**Solution Table:**

| Music-Genre   |  Metal  | Reggae | Ambient is not possible here because of D&B being in the middle, but we have to fill it; thus considering other constraints lets assume ""x"" for now | d&b   | Funk  | Classical | Dubstep |

Given our current setup doesn't account for every genre and clue perfectly yet (missing genres are Ambient and incorrectly placed x), let's correct this:

- Reggae must be followed by Classical-Dubstep, which means the order after D&B is fixed as per clues.
- Metal has to be on the left of Funk with D&B in the middle. This suggests a rearrangement where Funk is at position 5 or 6 and considering clue 6 (Funk next to D&B), let's adjust accordingly.

Given the constraints, we might have made an incorrect assumption about direct placements but sticking strictly to clues:

- Metal can't be directly next to D&B because of clue 6 regarding Funk.
- Reggae-Classical-Dubstep form a necessary sequence based on clues 3 and 4, placing them after considering D&B's position.

Let's adjust with all genres in mind and correct any oversight by strictly following the clues again:

1. Metal fan is to the left of Funk fan.
2. The fan of d&b is in the middle (position 4).
3. Classical fan is on the right of Reggae fan, but Dubstep also has to be on the right of Classical.

Given these constraints and correcting for a solution table that fits all genres:

The final arrangement considering all clues correctly would ensure:
- D&B's position as the pivot.
- Metal-Funk around it with Funk closer or next to D&B.
- Reggae-Classical-Dubstep sequence after placing other constraints.

| Music-Genre   |  Metal  | Ambient | Reggae | d&b | Funk   | Classical | Dubstep |

This solution adheres to the constraints:
- Metal is on the left of Funk.
- D&B is in the middle (position 4).
- Classical and Dubstep are together, with Classical on the left of Dubstep.
- The fan of classical is on the right of Reggae.

From clue 6, since ice-hockey can be on either far left or far right, let's consider both possibilities.

Case 1: Ice-hockey is on the far left (position 1)

In this case, from clue 2, swimming must be in position 2. From clue 1, lacrosse must be on the left of swimming, but it can't be on the far left since ice-hockey occupies that spot. Therefore, lacrosse can't be next to swimming as required by clue 5. This case leads to a contradiction.

Case 2: Ice-hockey is on the far right (position 7)

In this case, from clue 2, swimming must be in position 6. From clue 1, lacrosse must be on the left of swimming.

Since surfing is in the middle (clue 7), it occupies positions 3 or 4. Let's place surfing in position 4.


Now, from clue 5, lacrosse can't be next to swimming. The only remaining spot for lacrosse is position 1.

From clue 3, skiing is on the left of tennis. Since volleyball (clue 4) is on the left of skiing, we have:
