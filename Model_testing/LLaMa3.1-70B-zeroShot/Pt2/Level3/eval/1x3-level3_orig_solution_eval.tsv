Lv3-1x3-1	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The fan of trance is on the far left or far right.
This means that the trance fan can only be in position 1 or position 3.

2. The fan of soul is on the left of the fan of trance.
Since the trance fan is on the far left or far right, if they are on the far left (position 1), there would be no one to their left. Therefore, the trance fan must be on the far right (position 3).

Now we know that the trance fan is in position 3, and the soul fan is to their left, which means the soul fan is in position 2.

The only genre left is rock, which must be in position 1.

Lv3-1x3-2	"Let's analyze the puzzle step by step.


From clue 1, we know that the horse's owner can be either at position 1 or 3.


From clue 2, we know that the snake's owner is in the middle, which means the snake's owner is at position 2.


From clue 3, we know that the snake's owner is to the right of the hamster's owner. Since the snake's owner is already determined to be at position 2, the hamster's owner must be at position 1.


Now, let's fill in the table:


|       |    1    |   2   |   3   |
| Pet   |         |       |       |

Since the hamster's owner is at position 1 and the snake's owner is at position 2, we know that the horse's owner must be at position 3.


Here is the final solution:


#############
|       |    1    |   2   |   3   |
| Pet   | Hamster | Snake | Horse |

Lv3-1x3-3	"Let's break down the clues:


Clue 1: The person driving the tram is on the far left or far right.
This means the tram can be either in column 1 or column 3.


Clue 2: The person driving the tram is on the right of the person driving the taxi.
This means the taxi cannot be on the far right, and the tram must be to the right of the taxi. Since the tram can only be in column 1 or column 3 (from Clue 1), this means:


* If the tram were in column 1 (far left), it would be impossible for the taxi to be to its left.
* Therefore, the tram must be in column 3 (far right).
* The taxi cannot be on the far right, so it must be either in column 1 or column 2.

Given this information, we can conclude that:


* Column 1: Taxi
* Column 2: Train (since the only remaining option is train)
* Column 3: Tram

Here's the final solution table with '#############' around it:

Lv3-1x3-4	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 1, we know that the person whose hobby is dancing is on the far left, so we can fill in the first column:

|         |    1    |   2    |    3    |
| Hobby   | Dancing |        |         |

From clue 2, we know that the person whose hobby is writing is on either the far left or far right. Since dancing is already occupied on the far left, writing must be on the far right:

|         |    1    |   2    |    3    |
| Hobby   | Dancing |        | Writing |

The only remaining hobby is sudoku, which can only go in column 2:

| Hobby   | Dancing | Sudoku | Writing |

Here is the final solution table:

Lv3-1x3-5	"After analyzing the clues, I'll fill in the table:


|               |     1     |  2   |   3    |
| Music-Genre   | classical | folk | techno |

The reasoning is as follows:

* Clue 1 states that the fan of techno is on the far right, so techno goes in column 3.
* Clue 2 states that the fan of classical is on the far left or far right. Since techno already occupies the far right, classical must be on the far left, which is column 1.

The only remaining option for folk is column 2.

Lv3-1x3-6	"Based on the clues, I will solve the puzzle.


From clue 3, we know that the person watching documentary movies is in the middle, so:


|               |     1     |      2      |      3       |
| Movie-Genre   |           | Documentary |              |

Now, from clue 2, we know that the person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the person watching documentary movies, so:

| Movie-Genre   |           | Documentary | Martial-Arts|

Finally, since the person watching adventure movies is not specified to be anywhere in particular, they must be in the remaining seat:

Lv3-1x3-7	"Let's analyze the clues:


From clue 2, we know the person drinking coffee can be in either position 1 or 3.


From clue 1, we know the person drinking coffee is to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate. This means if the person drinking coffee is in position 1, then the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 2.


If the person drinking coffee were in position 3 (far right), then there would be no space for the person drinking hot-chocolate to their right. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.


So, we can conclude that:


* The person drinking coffee is in position 1.
* The person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 2.
* The person drinking tea must be in position 3 (since there are only three options).


Here's the final solution table:

Since the person drinking almond-milk is on the far left, we can start by placing it in column 1.

| Beverage   | Almond-milk |          |         |

From clue 1, we know that the person drinking mirinda must be on either the far left or far right. Since almond-milk is already on the far left, mirinda must be on the far right.

Lv3-1x3-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.


From clue 1, we know that the manager is either in column 1 (far left) or column 3 (far right).


From clue 2, we know that the fisherman is to the right of the manager.


If the manager were in column 1, then the fisherman would have to be in column 2. But this would leave no room for the firefighter, since the fisherman can't be in column 3 (because the manager would be on his left). Therefore, the manager must be in column 3.


Now that we know the manager is in column 3, the fisherman must be in column 2 (to the right of... well, not to the right, but to the left of the manager, actually!). This leaves column 1 for the firefighter.


So, here's the final solution:

Since the Colombian is on the far left (clue 1), it goes in position 1.

| Nationality   | Colombian |         |         |

From clue 2, we know the Turkish person is to the right of the Mexican. This means the Mexican must be in either position 1 or 2. But since position 1 is already taken by the Colombian, the Mexican must be in position 2.

|               |     1     |    2    |    3    |
