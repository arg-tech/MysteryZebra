Lv3-1x2-1	"Based on the given conditions:


Since the person drinking soy-milk can be on the far left, and the person drinking fanta must be to their right (condition 2), we have:


|            |    1     |   2   |
| Beverage   | Soy-milk | Fanta |

 

This satisfies both conditions. The final solution table is:


#############
|            |    1     |   2   |
| Beverage   | Soy-milk | Fanta |

Lv3-1x2-2	"Based on the clues:


Clue 1: The architect is on the left or right of the electrician.
This clue does not provide enough information to determine the exact positions.


Clue 2: The electrician is on the right of the architect.
This clue directly contradicts Clue 1, but it provides a clear answer.

Since the electrician is on the right of the architect, we can conclude that:


The final solution table is:

Lv3-1x2-3	"To solve the puzzle, let's break down the clues:

Clue 1: The person whose hobby is woodworking is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is camping.
This means that they cannot be in the same position.

Clue 2: The person whose hobby is woodworking is on the left of the person whose hobby is camping.
This tells us the exact order: woodworking must come before (to the left of) camping.

Given these clues, there's only one possible arrangement:

#############
| Hobby   |      1      |    2    |
|         | Woodworking | Camping |
#############

So, the person whose hobby is woodworking is in position 1, and the person whose hobby is camping is in position 2."	{'hobby': ['1', '2']}	True	0	False
Lv3-1x2-4	"Let's analyze the clues:

Clue 1: The fan of soul is on the left of the fan of house.
This means that if we number the positions from left to right, the fan of soul must be in position 1 and the fan of house in position 2.

There is no need to consider Clue 2, as it simply repeats part of the information in Clue 1.

So, here is the solution:


#############
|               |  1   |   2   |
| Music-Genre   | soul | house |
#############"	{'music-genre': ['soul', 'house']}	True	2	True
Lv3-1x2-5	"Let's analyze the puzzle:


From clue 1, we know the manager is on the far left. Since there are only two jobs, the manager must be in column 1.


From clue 2, we know the scientist is on the left or right of the manager. However, since the manager is already on the far left (column 1), the scientist cannot be to the left of the manager. Therefore, the scientist must be on the right of the manager, which means the scientist is in column 2.


Here's the final solution table:


|       |    1    |     2     |
| Job   |         |           |
#############
| Job   | Manager | Scientist |

Lv3-1x2-6	"Based on the given clues, I will fill in the table:


Since clue 1 states that the person who likes camping is on either side of the person who likes card-games, and clue 2 states that the person who likes card-games is on the left of the person who likes camping, we can conclude that:

* The person who likes card-games must be in position 1.
* The person who likes camping must be in position 2.

Here is the solution table:


|         |     1      |    2    |
| Hobby   | Card-games | Camping |

Lv3-1x2-7	"Let's analyze the puzzle:


We have two people using different means of transport: a bike and a bus.


From clue 1, we know that ""the person driving the bus is on the right of the person driving the bike"". This gives us an initial arrangement:


|             |  1   |  2  |
| Transport   | Bike | Bus |

Now, let's look at clue 2: ""the person driving the bus is on the left or right of the person driving the bike##3"". However, since we already know from clue 1 that the bus is to the right of the bike, this clue doesn't provide any new information.


Therefore, our final solution table remains:


#############
|             |  1   |  2  |
| Transport   | Bike | Bus |

Lv3-1x2-8	"Let's analyze the clues:


Clue 1 states that the freelancer is on the left or right of the coach, but Clue 2 specifies that the freelancer is actually on the right of the coach.


So, we can conclude that the correct order is: Coach - Freelancer

Lv3-1x2-9	"Based on the given clues:


Clue 1 states that the social-worker is on the left or right of the bartender, but Clue 2 specifically states that the social-worker is on the left of the bartender.


Since there are only two jobs and two positions, this means the bartender must be in position 2. Therefore, the social-worker must occupy position 1.


Here's the completed table:


#############
|       |       1       |     2     |
| Job   | Social-Worker | Bartender |

Lv3-1x2-10	"Based on the given conditions:


Since the person drinking cola is on the left of the person drinking sprite (condition 2), and considering there are only two columns, we can conclude that the person drinking cola must be in column 1.


The remaining option for column 2 is sprite.


Therefore, the final solution table is:
