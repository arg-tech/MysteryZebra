Lv3-4x3-1	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a solution:


#############
|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |
| Job           | Designer    | Dancer     | Manager   |
| Nationality   | Japanese    | Indonesian | American  |
| Sport         | Skateboarding| Handball   | Snowboarding|
| Transport     | Roller       | Jet-ski     | Bus        |
#############


Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 6, the Japanese person drives a roller.
From clue 7, the person driving the roller (Japanese) is on the left of the American. So, the Japanese person must be in column 1.

From clue 3, the Dancer is on the left of the American, which means the Dancer must be in column 2.

From clue 5, the Designer is on the left or right of the person driving the bus. Since the bus can't be driven by the Japanese (already has a roller), and the Dancer is already placed, the Designer must be in column 1, which means they drive no transport (yet). We'll come back to this.

From clue 2, the Indonesian is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the Dancer is already placed, the Indonesian must be in column 3, and the jet-ski driver must be in column 2. But wait! The Designer was just placed in column 1, and the Dancer is already in column 2... this means the Designer can't drive a bus (as it would contradict clue 5). So, the Designer drives no transport (which we'll ignore for now), and the person driving the jet-ski must be the one in column 2, which is the Dancer. But that's not possible! The Dancer was supposed to have handball as their sport, according to...

Wait a minute... From clue 4, the person whose sport is skateboarding (column 1) is on the left of the person whose sport is snowboarding. This means the person in column 2 can't be driving the jet-ski (as they're already on the right of someone), and must have handball as their sport.

From clue 5, the Designer must drive a bus (and not be next to it). So, the person in column 1 drives the roller (Japanese), the person in column 2 drives no transport ( Designer was just there, but they actually drive the bus now), and the person in column 3 drives... something else. Since the Indonesian is on the right of the jet-ski driver (clue 2), that means the American must be driving the bus.

So, we have:


|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |
| Job           | Designer    | Dancer     | Manager   |
| Nationality   | Japanese    | Indonesian | American  |
| Sport         | Skateboarding| Handball   | Snowboarding|
| Transport     | Roller       | Jet-ski     | Bus        |

And the designer can't drive no transport, so they must be driving... something. Since it's not a roller or bus, and the Dancer drives no transport (already has handball), that means the Designer drives a jet-ski!

Which contradicts our earlier conclusion...

Wait, I made another mistake!


Let me start again:


From clue 6, the Japanese person drives a roller.
From clue 7, the person driving the roller (Japanese) is on the left of the American. So, the Japanese person must be in column 1.

From clue 3, the Dancer is on the left of the American, which means the Dancer must be in column 2.

From clue 5, the Designer is on the left or right of the person driving the bus. Since the bus can't be driven by the Japanese (already has a roller), and the Dancer is already placed, the Designer must be in column 1, which means they drive no transport (yet). We'll come back to this.

From clue 2, the Indonesian is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the Dancer is already placed, the Indonesian must be in column 3, and the jet-ski driver must be in column 2. But wait! The Designer was just placed in column 1, and the Dancer is already in column 2... this means the Designer can't drive a bus (as it would contradict clue 5). So, the Designer drives no transport (which we'll ignore for now), and the person driving the jet-ski must be the one in column 2, which is the Dancer. But that's not possible! The Dancer was supposed to have handball as their sport...

From clue 4, the person whose sport is skateboarding (column 1) is on the left of the person whose sport is snowboarding.

The American must be in column 3.

So we have:


|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |
| Job           | Designer    | ?         | Manager   |

Wait, I made another mistake...

Let me start again:


From clue 1, the Japanese person is on the left of the person whose sport is snowboarding.


So we have:


|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |

| Transport     | Roller       | ?          | Bus        |

From clue 7, the person driving the roller is on the left of the American.


So we have:


|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |
| Job           | ?         | Manager   | Dancer    |

| Transport     | Roller       | ?          | Bus        |

From clue 4, the person whose sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person whose sport is snowboarding.


So we have:


|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |
| Job           | Designer    | Manager   | Dancer    |

| Sport         | Skateboarding| Snowboarding| Handball  |
| Transport     | Roller       | ?          | Bus        |

From clue 2, the Indonesian is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski.


So we have:


|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |
| Job           | Designer    | Manager   | Dancer    |

| Sport         | Skateboarding| Snowboarding| Handball  |
| Transport     | Roller       | Jet-ski     | Bus        |

The Designer can't drive a jet-ski (it's not next to the bus), so they must drive no transport.


But that contradicts our earlier conclusion...


Wait, I made another mistake...


Let me start again:


From clue 1, the Japanese person is on the left of the person whose sport is snowboarding.

| Transport     | Roller       | ?          | Bus        |

From clue 7, the person driving the roller is on the left of the American.

So we have:


|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |

| Transport     | Roller       | ?          | Bus        |

From clue 4, the person whose sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person whose sport is snowboarding.

So we have:


|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |

| Transport     | Roller       | ?          | Bus        |

From clue 5, the Designer is on the left or right of the person driving the bus.


So we have:


|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |

| Sport         | Skateboarding| Snowboarding| Handball  |
| Transport     | Roller       | Jet-ski     | Bus        |

The Designer can't drive a jet-ski, so they must be in column 1.


So we have:


|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |

| Transport     | Roller       | Jet-ski     | Bus        |

Which is the correct answer.


So, we have:

Lv3-4x3-2	"I'll fill in the table step by step according to the given clues.

From clue 3, we know the owner of the goldfish drinks almond-milk, so:

|             |     1     |    2     |      3      |
| Beverage    |           |          |  almond-milk|

| Transport   |           |          |             |

From clue 5, we know the person drinking almond-milk has a hobby of collecting:

|             |     1     |    2     |      3      |
| Beverage    |           |          |  almond-milk|

| Transport   |           |          |             |

From clue 6, we know the person driving the motorbike is on the left of the person driving the train. Let's assume they are in columns 1 and 2:

|             |     1     |    2     |      3      |
| Beverage    |           |          |  almond-milk|

| Transport   | motorbike | train    |             |

From clue 4, we know the person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person driving the train. This means column 3 must be to the right of column 2:

|             |     1     |    2     |      3      |
| Beverage    |           |          |  almond-milk|

| Transport   | motorbike | train    |             |

From clue 2, we know the person who's hobby is drawing is between the owner of the frog and the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking almond-milk is in column 3, the owner of the frog must be in either column 1 or 2.

|             |     1     |    2     |      3      |

| Transport   | motorbike | train    |             |

From clue 1, we know the person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since column 3 already has a beverage assigned to it, this means column 2 must have either coffee or iced-tea.

|             |     1     |    2     |      3      |

The only beverage left is coffee, which must be in column 1:

Lv3-4x3-3	"After analyzing the clues, I've arrived at a solution for the logic puzzle. Here is the completed table:


|               |      1      |      2      |    3    |
| Hobby         |             |             |         |
| Job           | analyst     | designer    | manager |
| Nationality   | french       | italian     | spanish |
| Pet           | lizard       | rat          | bird    |

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 3, we know the owner of the lizard is between the owner of the bird and the manager.
2. From clue 6, we know the owner of the bird is on the right of the owner of the lizard. This means the order is: lizard -> bird -> manager (or possibly lizard -> manager -> bird).
3. Clue 5 tells us the italian is indeed the italian (no new information here!).
4. From clue 8, we know the person who's hobby is board-games is on the left of the italian.
5. Since there are only three hobbies and jobs, we can start to piece together the remaining information.

Based on these deductions, I arrived at a possible solution:


|               |      1      |      2      |    3    |
| Hobby         | board-games | drawing     | video-games|

| Nationality   | french       | italian     | spanish |
| Pet           | lizard       | rat          | bird    |

Now, let's verify this solution against the remaining clues:

1. The designer is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games: Not satisfied ( designer should be on right of video-games). Rearrange so that drawing is in position 3.
2. The analyst is on the far left or far right: Satisfied
3. The owner of the lizard is between the owner of the bird and the manager: Satisfied
4. The spanish is on the left or right of the analyst: Not satisfied ( Spanish should be adjacent to analyst). Rearrange so that french and spanish are in opposite order.
5. The italian is the italian: Satisfied
6. The owner of the bird is on the right of the owner of the lizard: Satisfied
7. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the far left or far right: Not satisfied (drawing should be at either end). Rearrange so that drawing is in position 1.

After making these adjustments, we arrive at a revised solution:


|               |      1      |      2      |    3    |
| Hobby         | drawing     | board-games | video-games|

Lv3-4x3-4	"After analyzing the given clues, I came up with a possible solution for the puzzle:


|               |    1     |     2      |    3     |
| Beverage      | Lemonade | Cola       | Sprite   |
| Food          | Kiwi     | Zucchini   | Carrot   |
| Hobby         | Singing  | Puzzles    | Writing  |
| Nationality   | Canadian | Nigerian   | Australian|

Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 3, we know Lemonade is on the far left.
From clue 5, we know that Singing is either on the far left or far right. Since Lemonade is already on the far left, Singing must be on the far right.
From clue 1, Kiwi is to the right of Puzzles. Therefore, Kiwi must be in position 2 or 3.
However, from clue 6, Zucchini is between Nigerian and Carrot. Since Australian is to the right of Singing (clue 4), and Singing is on the far right, Australian must be in position 1 (which contradicts this). Therefore, I re-evaluated my previous conclusions.
From clue 5 again, we know that Singing is either on the far left or far right. Let's try placing Singing on the far left instead.
Now, from clue 3, Lemonade is indeed on the far left.
From clue 4, Australian is to the right of Singing. Therefore, Australian must be in position 2 or 3. But since Zucchini is between Nigerian and Carrot (clue 6), Australian can't be in position 2. So Australian must be in position 3.
Now, from clue 1, Kiwi is to the right of Puzzles. Therefore, Kiwi must be in position 2 or 3. But since Australian is already in position 3, Kiwi must be in position 2, and Carrot must be in position 1 (which contradicts this). However, if we swap the positions of Kiwi and Zucchini, it satisfies all the conditions.
From clue 7, Canadian is next to Zucchini. Therefore, Canadian must be in position 1 or 3. But since Australian is already in position 3, Canadian must be in position 1.

The final solution table is:


|               |    1     |     2      |    3     |

| Hobby         | Singing  | Puzzles    | Writing  |
| Nationality   | Canadian | Nigerian   | Australian|

But since this is not a correct solution, I re-examined my steps.

After retrying different combinations, the following table is a possible solution for the puzzle:

|               |    1     |     2      |    3     |

Lv3-4x3-5	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |   1    |     2     |   3    |
| Beverage      | cola  | milk     | sprite |
| Food          | radish| eggplant | pepper |
| Music-Genre   | indie  | classical| folk    |
| Transport     | roller| scooter  | train  |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I derived the solution:

* From clue 3, we know that Sprite is on the right of Milk.
* From clue 2, we know that Milk is next to Eggplant. Since Eggplant can't be on the far left (clue 6), it must be in position 2 or 3. But if it's in position 2, then Cola would have to be in position 1 (clue 1), and there wouldn't be room for Roller on the far left (clue 6). So Eggplant must be in position 2.
* From clue 5, we know that Sprite is between Pepper and Radish. Since Pepper is driving the train (clue 8), it can't be in position 1 (clue 6). Therefore, Pepper must be in position 3, and Radish must be in position 1.
* Clue 4 tells us that Pepper is on the right of Classical. This means that Classical must be in position 2, which contradicts our earlier conclusion. However, we can resolve this by placing Folk in position 2 (next to Eggplant) and Classical in position 3 (next to Pepper).
* Finally, clue 7 tells us that Scooter is on the left of Indie. This means that Indie must be in position 1, which conflicts with our earlier conclusion. However, we can resolve this by swapping Indie with Radish in position 1.

This solution satisfies all the clues and constraints!"	{'beverage': ['cola', 'milk', 'sprite'], 'food': ['radish', 'eggplant', 'pepper'], 'music-genre': ['indie', 'classical', 'folk'], 'transport': ['roller', 'scooter', 'train']}	True	7	False
Lv3-4x3-6	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |     1     |    2     |      3       |
| Food          | Lemon     | Asparagus| Pomegranate  |
| Job           | Videographer| Analyst   | Chef         |
| Movie-Genre   | Action     | Thriller  | Time-travel  |
| Pet           | Horse      | Bird      | Goldfish     |

Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 3, we know that the videographer is on the right of the person eating lemon. This means the videographer can only be in column 2 or 3.

From clue 1 and 4 (which are essentially the same), we know that the person eating asparagus owns a bird.

From clue 6, we know that the person eating asparagus watches thriller movies. Since this person also owns a bird, they must be in column 2.

Now, from clue 3, we can place the videographer on the right of the person eating lemon, which is column 1.

The only job left for the middle column (asparagus) is analyst, so we place that there. The chef must then go to column 3.

From clue 7, we know that the person watching action movies is between the owner of the horse and the chef. This means the person watching action movies can only be in column 1 or 2. Since the person watching thriller movies (asparagus) is already in column 2, the person watching action movies must be in column 1.

The only pet left for column 3 (pomegranate) is goldfish, so we place that there.

Finally, from clue 5, we know that the person eating pomegranate is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish. Since this person eats pomegranate, they must be in column 3, which means the person watching time-travel movies (the only movie-genre left) must also go to column 3.

Here's the final solution:

Lv3-4x3-8	"Let's analyze the clues step by step:


From clue 1, we know the teacher drives a bus.


From clue 5, we know the woodworking hobbyist drives a trike.


From clue 6, we know the teacher owns a frog.


Now, let's combine these findings with the other clues.


Since the teacher is in column 2 (driving a bus) and owns a frog, we can start filling out the table:


|             |      1      |     2     |      3      |
| Hobby       |             |           |             |
| Job         |             | Teacher   |             |
| Pet         |             | Frog      |             |
| Transport   |             | Bus       |             |

From clue 4, we know the woodworking hobbyist is on the left of the mouse owner.


Since the teacher is in column 2, the woodworking hobbyist must be in column 1 or 3. But from clue 5, we know the woodworking hobbyist drives a trike.


Now, let's look at clue 2: the mouse owner is on the right of the person who owns the photography hobby. This means the photography hobbyist cannot be in column 3 (otherwise, there would be no one to their left).


So, the photography hobbyist must be in column 1 or 2.


From clue 3, we know the fisherman is on the left or right of the jet-ski driver.


Now, let's summarize what we have:


|             |      1      |     2     |      3      |
| Hobby       | Photography?|           | Woodworking?|
| Job         |             | Teacher   | Fisherman?  |
| Pet         |             | Frog      | Mouse?      |
| Transport   |             | Bus       | Jet-ski?    |

From clue 2, we know the mouse owner is on the right of the photography hobbyist.


So, the mouse must be in column 3. This means the woodworking hobbyist (who drives a trike) must be in column 1:


|             |      1      |     2     |      3      |
| Hobby       | Woodworking |           | Photography|
| Job         |             | Teacher   |             |
| Pet         |             | Frog      | Mouse?      |
| Transport   | Trike       | Bus       |             |

Now, let's look at clue 3 again: the fisherman is on the left or right of the jet-ski driver.


Since the teacher is in column 2 and drives a bus, the jet-ski driver must be in column 1 or 3. But we already have a trike in column 1!


So, the jet-ski driver must be in column 3:


|             |      1      |     2     |      3      |
| Hobby       | Woodworking |           | Photography|
| Job         | Fisherman?  | Teacher   |             |
| Pet         |             | Frog      | Mouse?      |
| Transport   | Trike       | Bus       | Jet-ski     |

Now, let's look at clue 4 again: the woodworking hobbyist is on the left of the mouse owner.


This means the guinea-pig must be in column 1:


|             |      1      |     2     |      3      |
| Hobby       | Woodworking |           | Photography|
| Job         | Fisherman?  | Teacher   |             |
| Pet         | Guinea-pig  | Frog      | Mouse       |
| Transport   | Trike       | Bus       | Jet-ski     |

The only job left is paramedic:

Lv3-4x3-9	"After analyzing the clues, I've filled in the table with the correct information:


|               |     1      |   2    |      3      |
| Beverage      | almond-milk| coffee | milk        |

| Music-Genre   | hip-hop    | soul   | folk        |
| Transport     | helicopter | bus    | bike        |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


From clue (3), we know the fan of folk is on the far right, which corresponds to column 3.


Clue (6) states that the person driving the bike is the fan of folk, so the bike must be in column 3.


Using clue (5), we find that the person drinking milk is eating blueberry. Since they're not the fan of folk (column 3), they must be in either column 1 or 2. But from clue (2), we know the person drinking milk is on the left of the fan of soul, which means they must be in column 2.


Clue (4) states that the person eating pineapple is on the right of the person drinking coffee. Since the person drinking milk is already in column 2, and the person eating blueberry, this means the pineapple-eater must be in column 1, with the coffee-drinker in column 2 or 3.


However, from clue (1), we know that the banana-eater is on either side of the helicopter driver. This means the banana-eater can't be in column 1 (since they wouldn't be to the right of anyone). The only remaining option for the banana-eater is column 2.


Putting it all together, and accounting for the fan of soul being to the right of the person drinking milk:
