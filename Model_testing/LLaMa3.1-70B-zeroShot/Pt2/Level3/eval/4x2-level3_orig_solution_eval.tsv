From clue 2, we know that the musician is on the right of the social-worker. This means that the social-worker must be in column 1, and the musician in column 2.

Clue 3 tells us that the person driving the bike is on the right of the Italian. Since the bike driver can't be in column 1 (because they're to the right of someone), the Italian must be in column 1.

Now, looking at clue 1, we know that the social-worker is on the left or right of the person drinking Fanta. But since the social-worker is already in column 1, it means the person drinking Fanta can't be in column 1 (otherwise, they wouldn't be to the ""left or right"" of the social-worker). So, the person drinking Fanta must be in column 2.

Let's put together what we have so far:


|               |       1       |    2     |
| Beverage      |               | Fanta   |
| Job           | Social-worker | Musician|
| Nationality   | Italian        |          |
| Transport     |               |          |

Now, let's fill in the remaining gaps. Since the person drinking Soy-milk isn't in column 2 (because that's where Fanta is), they must be in column 1. Similarly, since the Airplane isn't associated with the Italian (who's driving a bike), it must be associated with the Musician.

Here's the completed table:

From clue 1, we know that the owner of the cat is on the left or right of the person driving the scooter. Since the scooter driver is on the far left, the cat owner must be on the right.

#################


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 1, we know the fan of R&B is on the far right (person 2).
* Clue 4 tells us that the person driving the scooter is to the left of the fan of R&B. This means person 1 must be driving the scooter.
* Clue 3 implies that person 1 (scooter) and person 2 (quad-bike) are adjacent, which fits with the arrangement above.
* From clue 2, we know the hiker is to the left of the analyst. Given the scooter is already on the left, this means person 1 must be a hiker and have a different job than analyst.
* The only job left for person 1 is project-manager (since analyst is on the right). Person 2 then becomes an analyst.
* Finally, with folk being the remaining music-genre, we assign it to person 1."	{'hobby': ['hiking', 'board-games'], 'job': ['project-manager', 'analyst'], 'music-genre': ['folk', 'r&b'], 'transport': ['scooter', 'quad-bike']}	True	8	True

| Movie-Genre   |  epic   | action|
| Music-Genre   | disco   | trance|
| Pet           | hamster | rat   |


Here's my reasoning:

* From clue 2, we know the person drinking tea owns a hamster. Let's place them in column 1.
* Clue 3 states that the person drinking cola is to the right of the person watching epic movies. This means the epic movie fan must be in column 1 as well (tea).
* Now, let's consider clue 1: the disco fan is on the left or right of the rat owner. Given the current arrangement, we can place the disco fan in column 1 and the trance fan (who owns a rat) in column 2.
* Finally, since action movies are the only remaining genre, they must be paired with cola (and thus the rat).

Here is the solution table:

From clue 2, we know that the person eating kiwi is on the right of the person eating kale.

Since there are only two columns, this means that the person eating kale must be in column 1, and the person eating kiwi must be in column 2.

So, the table now looks like this:


|            |     1      |      2       |
| Beverage   |            |              |

| Sport      |            |              |

From clue 3, we know that the accountant is on the left of the person who's sport is tennis.

This means that the accountant must be in column 1.


So, the table now looks like this:


|            |     1      |      2       |
| Beverage   |            |              |

| Job        | Accountant |              |
| Sport      |            |              |

From clue 1, we know that the person eating kiwi is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up.

Since the person eating kiwi is in column 2, this means that the person drinking 7up must be in either column 1 or column 2.


However, since there are only two beverages and two columns, we know that the other beverage (Fanta) must be in the remaining column.


If the person drinking Fanta were in column 1, then the person eating kiwi would not be next to the person drinking 7up.


Therefore, the person drinking 7up must be in column 2.


So, the table now looks like this:


|            |     1      |      2       |
| Beverage   | Fanta      | 7up          |

| Job        | Accountant |              |
| Sport      |            |              |

From clue 3, we know that the accountant is on the left of the person who's sport is tennis.

This means that the sport in column 2 must be Tennis.


So, the table now looks like this:


|            |     1      |      2       |
| Beverage   | Fanta      | 7up          |

| Job        | Accountant |              |
| Sport      | Climbing   | Tennis       |

Finally, since there is only one job left (Entrepreneur), we can place it in the remaining column.


So, the final solution table looks like this:

From clue 3, we know that the person driving the scooter watches drama movies. This means column 2 must be ""Drama"" in the Movie-Genre row.

Clue 1 tells us that the person driving the scooter is on the left or right of the owner of the pony. Since the scooter driver watches drama movies (column 2), the pony must be in column 1, and the scooter driver must be in column 2.

Now, from clue 2, we know that the skateboard driver is to the left of the person who's hobby is writing. This means column 1 must have ""Skateboard"" as its transport method, and column 2 must have ""Writing"" as its hobby.

The only remaining option for the hobby in column 1 is ""Video-games"". Similarly, the only remaining option for the pet in column 1 is ""Goat"".

Clue 1 tells us that the person driving the roller is on the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing. If the person driving the roller was in column 1, then the person who's sport is sailing would have to be in column 2, which means they wouldn't be next to each other (as per clue 1). Therefore, the person driving the roller must be in column 2.

From clue 2, we know the owner of the cat is the person who's sport is sailing. Since the person driving the roller is in column 2 (as deduced above), this means the person whose sport is sailing must also be in column 2. Therefore, their pet is a cat.

The remaining pet, dog, goes to column 1. The remaining sport, swimming, also goes to column 1.

Clue 3 already told us that the quad-bike driver was on the left of the bartender, so we place the quad-bike in column 1.
