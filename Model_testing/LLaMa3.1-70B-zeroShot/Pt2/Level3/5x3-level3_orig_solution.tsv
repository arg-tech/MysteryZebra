| Beverage      | sprite    | hot-chocolate | cola       |

| Sport         | biathlon   | ice-hockey    | basketball |
| Transport     | skateboard | trike         | helicopter |

 

Note that I've filled in the missing information based on the clues provided. Here's a brief explanation of how each clue helped to solve the puzzle:


1. The person watching drama movies is between the person driving the helicopter and the dancer.
This means the person watching drama movies cannot be in position 1 or 3.


2. The person driving the helicopter is the person drinking cola.
From this, we know that cola must be in position 3, since it's mentioned as being on the right of the skateboard (which can't be in position 3 due to clue 3).


3. The person drinking cola is on the right of the person driving the skateboard.
This means the skateboard cannot be in position 3.


4. The person watching satire movies is on the far left or far right.
Since drama is between helicopter and dancer, and drama can't be on the far left/right, satire must be either far left or right.


5. The person watching mystery movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is biathlon.
This means that mystery cannot be in position 1 (since it would have to be on the left of biathlon) and also can't be in position 3 (due to clue 7).


6. The chef is the person drinking hot-chocolate.
This places hot-chocolate in position 2.


7. The person watching mystery movies is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
Since hot-chocolate is in position 2, mystery must be in position 3 (but due to clue 5 and the positions available), it actually goes into position 2.


8. The person who's sport is basketball is the person drinking cola.

By combining all these clues and working through them systematically, we arrive at the final solution table:

Lv3-5x3-2	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |     1      |       2       |       3       |
| Food          | Cucumber   | Pear          | Spinach       |

| Job           | Social-worker | Bartender    | Architect     |
| Movie-Genre   | Satire      | Superhero     | Scientific    |
| Transport     | Boat        | Scooter       | Subway        |

Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 4, we know the person driving the subway is on the far right, so column 3. From clue 2, we know this person watches scientific movies.

From clue 1, we know the person driving the scooter is on either side of the person eating cucumber. Since the subway driver is already in column 3, the scooter driver must be in column 2.

Clue 6 tells us the bartender's hobby is rock-climbing, and clue 5 says the bartender is to the right of the person eating cucumber. Therefore, column 1 has cucumber, and column 2 has pear (since spinach is left).

Now we can fill in the jobs: from clue 3, the architect must be in column 3 (to be between pear and skydiving), so the social-worker is in column 1.

Clue 7 says the person who's hobby is filmmaking is to the left of the satire movie fan. Since column 1 has cucumber, this means the satire movie fan is also in column 2, with superhero movies in column 3 (since scientific movies are already taken).

Finally, clue 6 tells us rock-climbing is the bartender's hobby, so we can fill in the hobbies.

Here is the final solution table:


|               |     1      |       2       |       3       |

| Beverage      |  cola     | soy-milk |   tea     |

| Nationality   | indonesian| turkish  | nigerian  |
| Transport     | bus       | train    | ship      |

Here's how I solved it:

From clue 5, we know the person drinking cola is Indonesian. From clue 7, we know the person driving the bus watches thriller movies.

From clue 3, we know the person drinking tea is on the right of the person driving the train. And from clue 4, we know the person watching family movies is also on the right of the person driving the train.

Combining these clues, we can deduce that the person drinking tea and watching family movies must be in column 3, since they are both to the right of the train.

From clue 6, we know the person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person who's hobby is hiking. And from clue 1, we know the person whose hobby is hiking is on the right of the person whose hobby is singing. Therefore, the person whose hobby is singing must be in column 1.

From clue 2, we know the person watching epic movies is on the left or right of the Turkish person. Since the Indonesian person (cola) is already in column 1, and the Nigerian person (family movies) is in column 3, the Turkish person must be in column 2.

Putting all these clues together gives us the final solution.

Lv3-5x3-4	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:


From clue 8, we know that the person who's sport is biathlon is on the left of the brazilian.


From clue 3, we know that the person who's sport is snowboarding is on the right of the person eating peach. Combining this with clue 2, we can conclude that the order is: biathlon, brazilian, peach, cat, snowboarding (since peach is on the left of the owner of the cat).


From clue 5, we know that the owner of the cat is on the right of the person who's sport is parkour. Combining this with the previous conclusion, we can conclude that the order is: biathlon, brazilian, peach, cat, snowboarding, parkour.


From clue 1, we know that the person eating pear is on the left or right of the person who's sport is parkour. Since there is no space to the left, pear must be to the right of parkour.


From clue 9, we know that the person eating pear is on the left of the owner of the lizard. Therefore, the order is: biathlon, brazilian, peach, cat, snowboarding, parkour, pear, lizard.


Now let's fill in the music-genres:


From clue 4, we know that the brazilian is on the left of the fan of techno. Therefore, techno must be in column 3 or 2 (since it can't be in column 1 because of biathlon).


From clue 6, we know that the fan of folk is on the left of the fan of ambient.


Since there are only three music-genres and two nationalities (brazilian and german) with known positions, we can conclude that italian must be in column 2. Also, since brazilian is in column 1 or 2, techno must be in column 3.


Now let's fill in the remaining information:


From clue 10, we know that the german is the person eating papaya.


Since pear is to the right of parkour and lizard is to the right of pear, we can conclude that the order is:


|               |    1     |     2     |      3       |
| Food          | biathlon | italian  | german       |
| Music-Genre   | folk     | ambient  | techno       |
| Nationality   | brazilian| italian  | german       |
| Pet           | horse    | cat      | lizard       |
| Sport         | biathlon | snowboarding| parkour      |

However, there is a mistake in the table above. The food column for column 2 should be peach and not papaya.


Here is the corrected solution:


#############
|               |    1     |     2     |      3       |
| Food          | papaya   | peach    | pear         |
| Music-Genre   | folk     | ambient  | techno       |
| Nationality   | brazilian| italian  | german       |
| Pet           | horse    | cat      | lizard       |
| Sport         | biathlon | snowboarding| parkour      |

The final answer is: 

However, the solution table above has papaya in column 1 which contradicts with clue 7. The correct solution should be:


#############
|               |    1     |     2     |      3       |
| Food          | pear   | peach    | papaya         |
| Music-Genre   | folk     | ambient  | techno       |
| Nationality   | brazilian| italian  | german       |
| Pet           | horse    | cat      | lizard       |
| Sport         | biathlon | snowboarding| parkour      |

Wait, that's not correct either!


Let me re-analyze the clues:


From clue 7, we know that the person eating papaya is on the right of the brazilian. Therefore, papaya must be in column 3 or 2.


However, from clue 10, we know that the german is the person eating papaya. Combining this with clue 7, we can conclude that brazilian and german are not in columns 1 and 3 respectively.


From clue 8, we know that the person who's sport is biathlon is on the left of the brazilian.


Combining the above information, we can conclude that column 1 must be biathlon and column 2 must be brazilian.


Now let's fill in the remaining information:


|               |    1     |     2     |      3       |
| Food          | pear   | peach or papaya | papaya or peach|
| Music-Genre   | folk     | ambient  | techno       |
| Nationality   | brazilian| italian or german | german or italian|
| Pet           | horse    | cat      | lizard       |
| Sport         | biathlon | snowboarding| parkour      |

However, from clue 2, we know that the person eating peach is on the left of the owner of the cat.


Therefore:


#############
|               |    1     |     2     |      3       |
| Food          | pear   | peach    | papaya         |
| Music-Genre   | folk     | ambient  | techno       |
| Nationality   | brazilian| italian  | german       |
| Pet           | horse    | cat      | lizard       |
| Sport         | biathlon | snowboarding| parkour      |

This solution does not satisfy clue 7 (person eating papaya is on the right of the brazilian). The correct order for column 1 and 2 should be reversed.

From clue 6, we know the chef is on the far right. From clue 9, we also know that the person who's sport is climbing is on the far right. Since there can only be one person on the far right, this means the chef and the person who's sport is climbing are the same person.

Now, from clue 3 and 4, we know the person driving the van is in the middle. From clue 5, we also know that the person who's sport is tennis is between the owner of the mouse and the entrepreneur. Since there are only three positions, this means the person driving the van must be the entrepreneur.

Now, let's look at clue 1: the owner of the horse is on the left or right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since there is no one to the right of the person who's sport is tennis (they're in position 2), this means the owner of the horse must be in position 1.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 3, we know that the person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the person watching musical movies. Since there are only three columns, this means that Reading must be in column 1 and Musical must be in column 2.
* From clue 2, we know that the person watching musical movies is the person who's hobby is cooking. Therefore, Cooking must also be in column 2.
* From clue 4, we know that the person who's hobby is cooking is the person who's sport is rowing. So, Rowing must be in column 2 as well.
* Clue 5 tells us that the person who's hobby is reading is on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since Reading is already in column 1, Weightlifting must be in column 1 as well.
* From clue 7, we know that the person watching sports movies is on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. This means that Sports must be in either column 2 or 3. But since Musical is already in column 2, Sports must be in column 3.
* Clue 1 tells us that the person watching sports movies is on the left or right of the person driving the train. Since Sports is in column 3, Train must also be in column 3.
* From clue 8, we know that the owner of the lizard is on the right of the person driving the bike. This means that Lizard and Bike are in columns 2 and 1, respectively.
* Clue 9 tells us that the owner of the goat is on the left or right of the owner of the lizard. Since Goat can't be in column 3 (because Sports is there), Goat must be in either column 1 or 2. But since Reading is already in column 1, Goat must be in column 1 as well.
* The only remaining options are Biathlon and Turtle, which must go in columns 3 and 2, respectively.

This solution satisfies all the clues, and I hope it's correct!"
Lv3-5x3-8	"After analyzing the clues, I've arrived at a solution for the logic puzzle. Here's the completed table:


|               |    1    |     2      |       3       |
| Hobby         | puzzles | skydiving  | singing       |
| Movie-Genre   | scientific | fantasy  | spy           |

| Sport         | sailing  | basketball| skateboarding|
| Transport     | bus      | skateboard| tram          |

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

From clue (2), we know that the person with basketball is on the left of skydiving. This means that skydiving cannot be in column 1, since it needs to have someone to its left.

Clue (3) tells us that the hamster owner has basketball as a sport. Clue (5) says that skateboarding and skydiving go together. So, we can deduce that column 2 will have basketball on the left and skydiving/skateboarding on the right.

From clue (1), we know that fantasy is to the right of sailing. This means that sailing cannot be in column 3, since it needs to have someone to its right. Thus, sailing goes into column 1.

Clue (4) tells us that scientific movies are to the right of puzzles. Clue (6) says that puzzles is adjacent to bus transport. Therefore, we can place puzzles and bus in columns 1 and 2 or columns 2 and 3. Given that we already have sailing in column 1, we'll put puzzles and bus in columns 1 and 2.

Clue (7) tells us that tram is to the right of pony. Clue (8) says that skateboard is to the right of fantasy. This means that pony must be in column 2, which also places tram in column 3.

Finally, using the remaining options for each category, we can fill out the rest of the table.
