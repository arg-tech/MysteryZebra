| Transport     | ship    | van        | subway      | bus       |

From clue 2, we know that the person driving the van is between the australian and the fan of folk.

| Transport     | ship    | van        | subway      | bus       |

From clue 1, we know that the fan of indie is on the right of the person driving the van. Therefore:

Lv3-3x4-2	"After solving the logic puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


|               |      1      |     2     |     3      |      4      |

| Hobby         | photography | card-games| singing    | woodworking |
| Movie-Genre   | thriller    | superhero | romance    | epic        |

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

1. From clue 4, we know that the person watching thriller movies is on the far left.
2. Clue 5 tells us that the person watching thriller movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is singing. Since the thriller movie fan is on the far left, they must be to the left of the singer.
3. From clue 1, we know that the person whose hobby is photography is on the far left, which means they are also watching thriller movies (from step 1).
4. Clue 7 tells us that the person eating cucumber is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games. This places cucumber in position 1.
5. From clue 2, we know that the person eating avocado is to the left of the person eating peach. This means that avocado must be in position 2 and peach in position 3.
6. Clue 3 tells us that the person watching superhero movies is on the left of the person eating corn. Since epic movies are on the right of corn (from clue 6), this places superhero movies in position 2.
7. From clue 5, we know that the singer must be either to the left or right of the thriller movie fan (photographer). Given the other constraints, they can only fit in position 3.

With these steps, the solution falls into place!

Lv3-3x4-3	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.


From clue 7, we know the person drinking almond-milk is on the far left:


|               |      1      |    2    |    3     |    4     |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk |         |          |          |

| Sport         |             |         |          |          |

From clue 4, we know the person who's sport is sailing is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk:


|               |      1      |    2    |    3     |    4     |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk |         |          |          |
| Nationality   |             |         |          |          |
| Sport         |             | Sailing |          |          |

From clue 6, we know the person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person who's sport is baseball:


Since the person who's sport is sailing is already in column 2, the person who's sport is baseball must be in column 1 (which is already occupied by the person drinking almond-milk), or column 3. Let's assume it's in column 3 for now.


|               |      1      |    2    |    3     |    4     |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk |         | Soy-milk |          |
| Nationality   |             |         |          |          |
| Sport         | Baseball    | Sailing |          |          |

Now, let's use clue 5. The Malaysian is on the far left or far right. Since the person drinking almond-milk is already on the far left, the Malaysian must be on the far right.


From clue 1, we know the Dutch is on the far right. This means the Malaysian and the Dutch are in columns 3 and 4, but we don't know which one is which yet.


|               |      1      |    2    |    3     |    4     |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk |         | Soy-milk |          |
| Nationality   |             |         | Malaysian| Dutch    |
| Sport         | Baseball    | Sailing |          |          |

From clue 8, we know the person who's sport is cycling is on the right of the person drinking fanta.


Since the person who's sport is sailing is already in column 2, the person drinking fanta must be in either column 1 or 3. However, since column 1 is occupied by the person drinking almond-milk and column 3 is occupied by the person drinking soy-milk, this means the person drinking fanta must be in column 1 (which is already occupied) or there's a mistake in our previous assumptions.


Let's re-examine our previous assumptions. We assumed that the person who's sport is baseball was in column 3. However, we didn't consider another possibility - what if the person who's sport is baseball was actually in column 1?


If that's the case, then the person drinking soy-milk would be in column 2 or 4 (since they need to be on the right of the person who's sport is baseball). This means we have more flexibility with our previous assumptions.


Let's try again. We know the person drinking almond-milk is on the far left:


|               |      1      |    2    |    3     |    4     |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk |         |          |          |
| Nationality   |             |         |          |          |
| Sport         | Baseball    |          |          |          |

From clue 4, we know the person who's sport is sailing is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk:


|               |      1      |    2    |    3     |    4     |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk |         |          |          |
| Nationality   |             |         |          |          |
| Sport         | Baseball    | Sailing |          |          |

From clue 6, we know the person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person who's sport is baseball:


|               |      1      |    2    |    3     |    4     |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk | Soy-milk|          |          |
| Nationality   |             |         |          |          |
| Sport         | Baseball    | Sailing |          |          |

Now, let's use clue 8. The person who's sport is cycling is on the right of the person drinking fanta.


Since the person who's sport is sailing is already in column 2, and we have a beverage already assigned to column 3 (although it might be incorrect), the person drinking fanta must be either in column 1 or 3. However, since column 1 is occupied by the person drinking almond-milk, this means the person drinking fanta must be in column 4.


|               |      1      |    2    |    3     |    4     |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk | Soy-milk|          | Fanta   |
| Nationality   |             |         |          |          |
| Sport         | Baseball    | Sailing | Cycling  |          |

Now, let's use clue 5. The Malaysian is on the far left or far right. Since the person drinking almond-milk is already on the far left, this means the Malaysian must be on the far right.


However, we also know that the Dutch is on the far right (from clue 1). This is a contradiction!


We made an incorrect assumption somewhere along the line.


Let's go back to our previous assumptions. We assumed that the person who's sport was sailing was in column 2. What if they were actually in column 3 or 4?


If we re-arrange everything, this could be the solution:


|               |      1      |    2    |    3     |    4     |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk | Fanta   | Soy-milk | Coffee  |
| Nationality   | British     | Polish  | Malaysian| Dutch    |
| Sport         | Baseball    | Cycling | Sailing  |          |

Now, let's use clue 8. The person who's sport is cycling is on the right of the person drinking fanta.


This matches our solution!


We still need to figure out the last sport. From clue 2, we know the person drinking coffee is on the left or right of the Malaysian.


Since the person drinking coffee is already in column 4 and the Malaysian is in column 3, this condition is satisfied.


However, what if we swap columns 2 and 3?


|               |      1      |    2    |    3     |    4     |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk | Soy-milk| Fanta   | Coffee  |
| Nationality   | British     | Malaysian| Polish  | Dutch    |
| Sport         | Baseball    | Sailing | Cycling |          |

Now, let's re-check our conditions. The person drinking coffee is still on the left or right of the Malaysian.


The person who's sport is cycling is no longer on the right of the person drinking fanta!


We need to swap columns 2 and 3 again.


|               |      1      |    2    |    3     |    4     |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk | Fanta   | Soy-milk | Coffee  |
| Nationality   | British     | Polish  | Malaysian| Dutch    |
| Sport         | Baseball    | Cycling | Sailing  |          |

Finally, we can fill in the last sport. The only remaining sport is climbing.


This must be assigned to column 4 (the person drinking coffee).


Here's our final solution:

Lv3-3x4-4	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:

| Movie-Genre   | action | time-travel| drama    | family    |
| Pet           | turtle | goat       | lizard   | dog       |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 4, we know kiwi is on the far left.
* From clue 3, we know the owner of the lizard is to the right of the person eating kiwi, so the lizard must be in position 2 or 3. But since the goat is between drama and avocado (clue 1), and drama is to the right of the goat (clue 6), the lizard can't be in position 2. So it must be in position 3.
* From clue 7, we know pineapple is to the right of action movies, so action movies must be in position 1 or 2. Since kiwi is already in position 1, action movies must be in position 2 or not at all (because of clue 2). But since drama is to the right of the goat, and the goat is between drama and avocado, action movies can't be in position 3 or 4. So it must be in position 1 is already taken by kiwi so action movie will be in column 2.
* From clue 8, we know time-travel movies are on either side of broccoli, but since action movies are already in position 2 and pineapple (and dog) are to its right, time-travel movies must be in position 2 is not available. The only available left column from broccoli will be column 1 or kiwi so that means there has been a mistake previously we need to swap columns of the  action movie genre and the time travel movie.
* By process of elimination, the remaining food (avocado) goes in position 3, and the remaining pet (goat) goes between drama and avocado as stated by clue 1.


I apologize for any mistakes. Here is the corrected solution table:


|               |   1    |      2      |    3     |     4     |

From clue 1, we know that the person eating eggplant is on the far right.

From clue 5, we know that the lawyer is on the right of the librarian. Since the person eating eggplant is already placed on the far right (clue 1), and there's no mention of a specific job for this person, let's assume the lawyer can't be in column 4.

From clue 6, we know that the person watching drama movies is on the right of the person eating raspberry.

Lv3-3x4-6	"After analyzing the clues, I think I have found the solution:


#############
|               |    1     |    2     |      3       |      4       |

| Sport         | Biathlon | Rowing   | Golf          | Baseball     |
#############


Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 1, we know that the coach is the person who likes biathlon.

Clue 3 tells us that the coach is to the left of the baseball fan. Since there are only four positions, this means that the coach must be in position 1 or 2.

Clue 5 says that the reggae fan is next to the biathlon fan (the coach). Given that the coach is in position 1 or 2, the reggae fan must also be in one of these two positions. If we put them together, we can conclude that the coach is a reggae fan and is in position 1.

Now, let's look at clue 8: ""the doctor is on the left of the fan of rock"". Clue 2 tells us that the golf fan likes rock music. So, the doctor must be to the left of the golf fan (in position 2).

The funk fan must be in position 3, since they are not next to the coach (reggae fan) and are also not the doctor.

Clue 6 says that the entrepreneur is on the left of the rowing fan. The only available positions for the entrepreneur and rowing fan are positions 3 and 4. But wait! If we put them there, it would contradict clue 7: ""the doctor is on the right of the fan of funk"". So, the rowing fan must be in position 2 or 3.

Given that the doctor is in position 2 and likes being next to the funk fan, the funk fan must be in position 3. And since the entrepreneur is on the left of the rowing fan, they must be in positions 2 and 4 (in this order).

Now we have:


|               |    1     |    2     |      3       |      4       |
| Job           | Coach    | Doctor   | ?            | ?            |
| Music-Genre   | Reggae   | Funk     | Indie        | Rock         |
| Sport         | Biathlon | Rowing   | Golf          | Baseball     |

The only job left for position 3 is entrepreneur, and the only one left for position 4 is videographer.

Finally, we know that the indie fan must be next to the golf fan (clue 4). The only available positions are positions 2 and 3. But wait again! If we put them there, it would contradict our previous conclusions about the doctor's position. So, the indie fan must be in position 3 or 4.

And that's how we arrived at the final solution!

Lv3-3x4-7	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############

|               |      1       |    2     |     3     |     4     |
| Hobby         | Camping     | Gardening| Traveling | Writing   |
| Job           | Bartender   | Doctor   | Videographer| Dancer  |
| Nationality   | Mexican     | Japanese | American  | Brazilian |

#############


Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* From clue 2, we know that the Japanese person is on either side of the person who likes traveling.
* Clue 5 tells us that the Japanese person is also on the left of the person who likes gardening.
* Combining these two clues, we can conclude that the order is: Japanese - Gardening - Traveling.
* From clue 9, we know that the American is on the right of the person who likes gardening, so the order becomes: Japanese - Gardening (American) - Traveling.
* Clue 4 tells us that the doctor is on the right of the Japanese, and since the dancer is also a Japanese person (clue 11), the doctor must be in column 2 or 3. But if the doctor were in column 3, it would contradict clue 7 (the doctor is on the right of the person who likes camping). Therefore, the doctor must be in column 2.
* Clue 1 tells us that the Brazilian is on either side of the American, but since the American is already in column 3 or 4, and we have a Japanese person in column 1, the Brazilian must be in column 4.
* The remaining clues can be used to fill in the gaps:
	+ Clue 7 tells us that the doctor is on the right of the person who likes camping, so the Mexican person (the only one left) must like camping and be in column 1.
	+ Clue 10 tells us that the dancer is on either side of the doctor, but since the Japanese person is already a dancer, it must be referring to another pair. The only possible combination is for the videographer to be in column 3 (and have the American nationality) and the dancer to be in column 4.
	+ Clue 6 tells us that the person who likes traveling has no other hobbies, but we've already placed them correctly based on earlier clues.
	+ Finally, clue 8 tells us that the Japanese is on either side of the videographer, which confirms our previous placement.

Lv3-3x4-8	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a solution:


|               |     1      |      2       |    3     |      4      |

| Hobby         | hiking     | magic-tricks | dancing  | board-games|
| Movie-Genre   | western    | mystery     | action    | spy         |

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:


From clue 5, we know the person eating pineapple is on the right of the person eating watermelon.


Clue 1 states that the person who's hobby is dancing is on the left or right of the person eating pineapple. Since dancing can't be on the far left (because of the watermelon), it must be to the right of pineapple.


From clue 6, we know that the person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is hiking. Also, from clue 3, we know that the person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is hiking.


We can now place the person eating watermelon and the person watching western movies in column 1.


From clue 4, we know that the person watching spy movies is on the far right.


Clue 7 states that the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left or right of the person eating zucchini. Also, from clue 8, we know that the person who's hobby is hiking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.


Considering all these constraints, the only possible arrangement for columns 2 and 3 is broccoli with mystery movies, pineapple with action movies (due to clue 2), and dancing as the hobby.


The final column is zucchini with spy movies and board-games as the hobby (the remaining option).


Therefore, the solution table is:

Lv3-3x4-9	"Here's my attempt to solve the logic puzzle:

| Job           | Doctor   | Security-Guard  | Nurse     | Dressmaker|
| Movie-Genre   | Adventure| Documentary     | Animation | Musical   |

Let's go through the steps:


From (2), we know that the doctor is to the left of the documentary movie fan.


From (4), the security-guard is to the right of the nurse. Also, from (7), the security-guard is to the right of the sprite drinker.


From (3), the fanta drinker is on either side. Given that there's no restriction for Fanta being in column 2 or 3, I'll place it at position 1.


Considering (6), tea must be on the left of water, so we can put them at positions 3 and 4 respectively isn't possible as dressmaker has to be at far right from statement (1). Thus tea is placed at column 3


Musical movie fan should be in last column according to (5)


Sprite drinker cannot be at position 1 since Fanta's already occupying it. Let's place the sprite drinker at position 2, and put security-guard on its right.


Security guard will push nurse one step back from the end as mentioned in statement (4), so we'll shift nurse to column 3 which would make tea drinker occupy position 2 or be pushed forward by one


If we try shifting tea to the second column that leaves sprite for third and water has no place left, pushing us against statement 6. Thus dressmaker and musical movies stays at last column as per statements (1) and (5)


Finally animation comes on right of documentary from statement (8), making adventure only option left


The final solution table is:

From clue 5, we know that the person watching thriller movies is the person eating raspberry.


|               |    1     |     2     |      3      |     4     |

| Nationality   |          |           |             |           |

From clue 8, we know that the person eating garlic is on the far left or far right. Since the far right is already occupied by raspberry, the person eating garlic must be on the far left.


|               |    1     |     2     |      3      |     4     |

| Nationality   |          |           |             |           |

From clue 3, we know that the person eating garlic is on the left or right of the chinese. Since garlic is already placed on the far left, the chinese must be in position 2.

| Nationality   |          | Chinese   |             |           |

From clue 1, we know that the person watching horror movies is on the far left or far right. Since the far right is already occupied by thriller, and the far left is already occupied by garlic, the person watching horror movies cannot be in position 1. However, this contradicts with the fact that garlic can only be on the far left (clue 8). Therefore, we need to re-evaluate clue 3.


Let's try placing chinese on the right of garlic instead.


|               |    1     |     2     |      3      |     4     |

| Nationality   | Egyptian |           | Mexican    |           |

From clue 1, we know that the person watching horror movies is on the far left or far right. Since the far left is already occupied by crime (and garlic), the person watching horror movies must be in position 3.


|               |    1     |     2     |      3      |     4     |
