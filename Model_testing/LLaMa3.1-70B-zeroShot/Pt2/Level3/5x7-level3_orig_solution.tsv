Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

1. From clue 8, the thai is in the middle, so the manager (clue 1) is in position 4.
2. The writer is on the left of the person eating blueberry (clue 6), and since the writer is on the right of the manager (clue 13), the writer must be in position 5 or 6.
3. The security-guard eats eggplant (clue 5) and is not the thai, so they must be in position 3.
4. The person eating kiwi is on the right of the person eating eggplant (clue 10), so kiwi must be in position 4 or 5.
5. From clue 9, the dancer is on the right of the owner of the goat, and since the dancer is on the far left or far right (clue 2), they must be in position 7.
6. The person eating pineapple is the owner of the frog (clue 11) and is on the left or right of the bird (clue 14), so pineapple must be in position 1 or 7.
7. Since the german drinks juice (clue 20), they must be in position 2, and since the american is on the right of the person eating eggplant (clue 23), they must be in position 1.
8. The rest of the clues were used to fill in the remaining positions.

7. Clues 11 and 24 allowed me to place lime next to onion and tea next to fanta.
8. Clue 18 put horse with either soccer or snowboarding, but since clue 22 linked horse with snowboarding, I was able to confirm their positions.

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:


First, I used clues 2 and 14 to determine that the fan of r&b is the photographer and is on the right of the analyst. Then, using clue 1, I placed the security-guard on the far right.


Next, I applied clues 15 and 5 to place the person driving the skateboard in the middle and the person driving the ship to the left of the fan of r&b.


Using clue 22, I placed the fan of ambient on the far left. Then, using clue 16, I confirmed that the fan of ambient is indeed on the far left.


I applied clues 18 and 23 to place the software-developer driving the roller on the far left. Using clue 24, I determined that the person eating strawberry is also the software-developer.


Clue 25 allowed me to place the person eating apricot next to the person eating pumpkin. Then, using clue 19, I placed the person eating apricot on the right of the skateboard.


I used clues 3 and 20 to determine that the owner of the rabbit is the fan of gospel. Clues 17 and 21 allowed me to place the owner of the cat next to the fan of soul and the fan of gospel.


Clue 8 was used to place the owner of the ferret between the owner of the lizard and the owner of the goat. Using clue 26, I confirmed that the owner of the ferret is indeed on the left or right of the owner of the goat.


I applied clues 10 and 11 to determine that the owner of the hedgehog is on the far left. Clues 27 and 6 were used to place the chef next to the fan of soul and the person eating strawberry next to the owner of the lizard.


Using clue 9, I placed the person eating potato on the far right. Then, using clues 4 and 13, I determined that the fan of techno is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski, who is between the person driving the scooter and the person eating tomato.


Finally, using clue 28, I placed the person eating cherry on the right of the software-developer.
