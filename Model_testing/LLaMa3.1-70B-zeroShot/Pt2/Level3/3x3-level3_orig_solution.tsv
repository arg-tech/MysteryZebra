Lv3-3x3-1	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |
| Food          | Potato  | Peach    | Avocado   |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance | Superhero| Thriller  |
| Music-Genre   | Folk    | Reggae   | Rock      |


Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 1, the fan of rock is on the far left or far right. Since there are only three positions, this means the rock fan must be in position 1 or 3.

From clue 2, the person eating potato is on the far left or far right. This also means the potato eater must be in position 1 or 3.

Combining these two clues, it's likely that the person in position 1 eats potato and listens to rock music, but this would contradict clue 1, which states that the rock fan can't be in both positions. Therefore, I'll assume that the person in position 1 eats potato and listens to folk music (since folk is not mentioned in clues 1 or 2).

From clue 3, the fan of folk watches romance movies. This confirms my previous assumption that the person in position 1 eats potato and listens to folk music.

From clue 4, the fan of reggae is on the left of the person watching superhero movies. Since there's only one position between the two far ends, this means the reggae fan must be in position 2.

Clue 5 states that the person eating peach is between the person watching superhero movies and the person eating potato. This means the peach eater is in position 2, which contradicts my previous assumption about the reggae fan being in position 2. However, it's possible that the person in position 2 eats peach and listens to reggae.

The only remaining option for the rock fan is position 3. Therefore, I'll assume that the person in position 3 eats avocado and listens to rock music.

Putting everything together, we get:


|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |

| Nationality   | German     | Indonesian | Russian      |
| Pet           | Turtle     | Goat     | Dog          |

The reasoning is as follows:

* From clue 4, the owner of the turtle is on the left of the owner of the dog. This means the turtle cannot be in position 3.
* From clue 1, the person watching crime movies is on the far left or far right. If they were on the left, then from clue 2, the Russian would have to be in position 2, which contradicts clue 4 (since the owner of the dog can't be in position 3). Therefore, the person watching crime movies must be on the far right.
* From clue 2, the Russian is on the right of the person watching crime movies. This means the Russian must be in position 3.
* From clue 3, the person watching romance movies is between the owner of the turtle and the German. Since the owner of the turtle cannot be in position 3 (from clue 4), the only possibility is that the owner of the turtle is in position 1 and the German is in position 2 or vice versa.
* However, from clue 2, we know that the Russian is on the right of the person watching crime movies. Therefore, the German cannot be in position 3 (since the Russian already occupies it). This means the German must be in position 1 or 2. Given the above analysis, the only possibility is that the German is in position 1.

| Food    | avocado | onion   | radish   |
| Job     | nurse   | musician | writer  |
| Sport   | baseball | cycling | basketball|
#


Explanation:

From statement 4, we know that the person eating avocado is the person who's sport is baseball. From statement 2, we know that this person is on the far left.

So, column 1 should be: avocado - baseball

From statement 3, we know that the musician is in the middle, so column 2 should be the musician.

Now, from statements 5 and 6, we can conclude that basketball and cycling must be in columns 2 and 3 (in some order). Since basketball cannot be next to itself, it must be on either side of onion. 

But statement 1 tells us that the writer eats radish, so column 3 should have radish - writer.

And since we already established that column 2 is musician, it follows that column 2 should also have cycling and onion.

Statement 5 requires basketball to be next to onion, which would put it in column 3 if cycling were in column 2. But we know that the person eating radish (the writer) is in column 3, so this isn't possible.

So, column 2 must be: onion - musician - cycling

And column 3 must be: radish - writer - basketball"
Lv3-3x3-4	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table:


From clue 1, we know that the person with photography as their hobby is to the left of the person eating kiwi.


From clue 5, we know that the person who likes soccer is on the far right. We can start by filling this in:

|         |    1     |      2      |    3    |
| Food    |          |             |         |
| Hobby   |          |             |         |
| Sport   |          |             | Soccer |

From clue 2, we know that the person who likes lacrosse is to the left or right of the person eating plum. We can't place this yet, but we'll keep it in mind.


From clue 3, we know that the person who likes climbing is between the person who likes lacrosse and the person who likes puzzles.


From clue 4, we know that the person eating plum is to the left or right of the person who likes puzzles.


Let's try to combine these clues. Since the person with photography is to the left of the person eating kiwi (clue 1), and the person eating plum is to the left or right of the person who likes puzzles (clue 4), we can try placing the person who likes puzzles next to the person eating plum.


We'll place the person who likes lacrosse on one side of the person eating plum, since they need to be next to each other (clue 2). The person who likes climbing needs to be between the person who likes lacrosse and the person who likes puzzles (clue 3), so we can place them in the middle.


Here's a possible arrangement:


|         |    1     |      2      |    3    |
| Food    | Corn     | Plum        | Kiwi    |
| Hobby   | Photography | Puzzles     | Singing |
| Sport   | Lacrosse  | Climbing    | Soccer |

But wait, this doesn't work because the person with photography is not to the left of the person eating kiwi!


Let's try switching the positions of corn and plum:


|         |    1     |      2      |    3    |
| Food    | Plum     | Corn        | Kiwi    |
| Hobby   | Photography | Puzzles     | Singing |
| Sport   | Lacrosse  | Climbing    | Soccer |

This looks more promising!


However, we still need to make sure that the person who likes lacrosse is to the left or right of the person eating plum (clue 2). In this arrangement, they are indeed next to each other.


The final solution is:

2. The owner of the bird is on the right of the owner of the lizard: The owner of the bird (column 3) is to the right of the owner of the lizard (column 1).
3. The owner of the lizard is on the left or right of the owner of the horse: The owner of the lizard (column 1) is to the left of the owner of the horse (column 2).
4. The Japanese is on the right of the Brazilian: The Japanese (column 1) is not directly next to the Brazilian, but since there are only three columns, it must be that the Brazilian is in column 3 and the Japanese is in column 1.
5. The person eating asparagus is on the far left or far right: The person eating asparagus (Japanese) is indeed on the far left (column 1).
6. The person eating cauliflower is on the left or right of the owner of the lizard: The person eating cauliflower (French) is to the right of the owner of the lizard (Japanese).

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 2, the person driving the boat is on the far left or far right. From clue 3, the owner of the goat is on the left of the person watching adventure movies, and from clue 4, the owner of the goat is on the right of the owner of the hamster.

Combining these clues, we can deduce that:

* The owner of the goat cannot be in position 1 (far left), since they need to be on the right of the hamster.
* The person driving the boat must be in position 1 (far left).
* The owner of the goat is in position 3 (far right).

Clue 5 tells us that the person watching comedy movies is between the person driving the bike and the person driving the boat. Since the person driving the boat is in position 1, the person watching comedy movies must be in position 2.

The only remaining movie genre is mystery, which must be in position 1 (left of the person watching adventure movies).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


From clue 3, we know that the person who's sport is rowing is on the far left, so we can place rowing in column 1.


Clue 2 tells us that the person who's sport is rugby is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since rowing is already placed in column 1, collecting must be in column 1 as well.


Now, from clue 1, we know that the person driving the taxi is on the left of the person who's sport is rugby. Therefore, the taxi must be in column 2 (to the right of rowing) and rugby must be in column 3.


Clue 5 tells us that the person driving the motorbike is on the right of the person driving the taxi. Since the taxi is in column 1 or 2, and there's no room for another vehicle in column 1, the motorbike must be in column 3.


Finally, clue 6 says that the person who's hobby is fishing is on the left of the person driving the quad-bike. This means fishing must be in column 2 (to the right of collecting) and the quad-bike must be in column 3 (to the right of motorbike).

From clue 6, we know the person driving the scooter is on the far left. From clue 1, we also know that the owner of the turtle is on the far left. Therefore, the security-guard (from clue 5) owns a turtle and drives a scooter.

Clue 3 tells us the security-guard is to the left of the scientist, so the scientist must be in column 2.

From clue 4, we know the owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the owner of the mouse. The only remaining spot for the owner of the mouse is in column 2, and since the person driving the helicopter is not specified, it can go with the scientist.

The architect must be in column 3, as they are the only one left. Clue 2 tells us that the car driver is to the right of the scientist, so the architect drives a car.
