Note that I used the process of elimination and logical deductions to solve the puzzle. Here's a brief explanation of the steps:

1. From clue 30, we know the person driving the ship is the fan of techno, so we can fill in row 1.
2. From clue 29, we know the person driving the ship is on the far left, so we can place it in column 1.
3. From clue 4, we know the software-developer is on the far left, so we can place it in column 1.
4. From clue 15, we know the person watching drama movies is the person driving the ship, so we can fill in row 4.
5. We continue applying clues and using process of elimination to fill in the rest of the table.

Note that I used the information from all 38 clues to deduce the correct order of each person's characteristics.

Here is a brief explanation of how I solved it:

* Clues 1-5 provided initial constraints on the positions of some people, such as the dog owner and the fan of electronic.
* Clue 7 connected woodworking with rabbit ownership, and clue 14 connected scientific movies with woodworking.
* Clue 10 linked epic movies with handball, and clue 16 connected soul music with badminton.
* Clues 21-23 placed the social-worker in the middle, which helped to anchor some of the other positions.
* Clue 25 constrained the hedgehog owner to be on the far left or right, which ultimately led to placing them on the far right (column 7).
* Clue 36 provided a constraint on the rat owner's position relative to the Malaysian.
* Clues 37 and 38 helped to narrow down the positions of some people based on their proximity to others.

Using these constraints, I iteratively deduced the correct order for each characteristic until all clues were satisfied."
