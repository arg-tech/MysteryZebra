Lv3-1x6-1	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a possible solution:


|       |     1     |   2   |        3        |     4     |    5     |   6    |
| Job   | Bartender | Pilot | Engineer | Fisherman | Project-manager | Writer |

Here's how the clues lead to this solution:

* Clue 1: The bartender is on the far left (1).
* Clue 5: The pilot is on the right of the bartender, so the pilot must be in position 2.
* Clue 3 and 4 together imply that the engineer and fisherman must be adjacent to each other, with one of them being next to the bartender or pilot. Given the positions of the bartender and pilot, it's more likely that the engineer is in position 3, followed by the fisherman (to satisfy clue 6).
* Clue 2: The pilot is on the left of the project-manager, so the project-manager must be after the fisherman.
* Clue 6: The project-manager is on the left of the fisherman, which we've already satisfied.

The only job left is the writer, which can go in position 6.

# 

Explanation:

From statement 7, we know the person eating nectarine is on the left of the person eating orange.

From statements 1 and 2, we can conclude that the order for orange, watermelon, and papaya is: O-W-P (Orange-Watermelon-Papaya).

Statement 3 says apricot is next to lettuce. Statement 6 says nectarine is next to apricot. So far we have two groups:
1) N-A or A-N
2) A-L or L-A

Since the order for orange, watermelon, and papaya is already decided (O-W-P), and statement 5 says orange is on either side of watermelon, we can place these three in a row in between the other two groups.

Considering the constraints from statements 3, 5, 6, and 7, the only possible arrangement is:
N-A-L-O-W-P"
Lv3-1x6-3	"Based on the given conditions, I'll solve the puzzle step by step:


From condition 3, we know the person eating carrot is on the left of the person eating kiwi.
Let's assume the order is: Carrot - Kiwi


From condition 2, we know the person eating lime is on the right of the person eating kiwi. So, the updated order is:
Carrot - Kiwi - Lime


Now, from condition 5, we know the person eating asparagus is on the left or right of the person eating lime.
Also, from condition 6, we know the person eating pomegranate is on the right of the person eating asparagus.


Considering both conditions, let's assume Asparagus is to the left of Lime:
Carrot - Kiwi - Asparagus - Lime
Then, Pomegranate should be to the right of Asparagus, but this contradicts condition 7. So, we swap Asparagus and Pomegranate:
Carrot - Kiwi - Pomegranate - Lime is not possible.


Now, let's assume Asparagus is to the right of Lime:
Carrot - Kiwi - Lime - Asparagus
Then, Pomegranate should be to the right of Asparagus, but this also contradicts condition 7. So, we swap Asparagus and Pomegranate again:
Carrot - Kiwi - Lime - Pomegranate is not possible either.


Re-examining condition 5, let's try placing Asparagus to the left of Kiwi:
Asparagus - Carrot - Kiwi - Lime


Now, from condition 7, we know Pomegranate is between Cranberry and Asparagus. So, the order becomes:
Cranberry - Pomegranate - Asparagus - Carrot - Kiwi - Lime


This order satisfies all conditions. The final solution table is:

Lv3-1x6-4	"Let's analyze the clues step by step:


From clue 1, the person who's hobby is fishing can be either at position 1 or 6.


From clue 2, photography is to the left of dancing.


From clue 3, woodworking is to the left of fishing.


From clue 4 and 6, gardening is to the left of board-games.


Now let's combine the information:


* Woodworking is to the left of fishing (clue 3)
* Fishing can be either at position 1 or 6 (clue 1). But if it were at position 1, woodworking would have to be outside the table. So, fishing must be at position 6.
* Woodworking is then at position 5.


From clue 2 and the above deduction:


* Photography can't be at position 6 since dancing is not on the right (fishing occupies that space). 
* Therefore photography and dancing are together but to the left of woodworking.
* The only possible arrangement is photography, dancing in positions 3-4 or positions 1-2.


However from clue 5:


* Dancing has to be next to woodworking which limits our options for the pair (photography and dancing)


Hence we must place the pair at position 3-4


The table now looks like this:


| Hobby | Fishing can't fit here |  | Photography  |  Dancing   | Woodworking | Fishing |
 


We're left with two hobbies: board-games, gardening. We know from clue 4 that they are next to each other.


But we also know from clue 6 that gardening is on the left of board games


So our final solution table looks like this:


| Hobby | Gardening  | Board Games  | Photography  | Dancing   | Woodworking | Fishing |
 

Now let's put '#############' around it:

Lv3-1x6-5	"Based on the given clues, I will solve the puzzle and provide the final solution.


First, we know that:


* The person driving the airplane is on the far left (Clue 4), so it must be in column 1.
* The person driving the trike is on the far right (Clue 5), so it must be in column 6.

We can start filling in the table:


|             |    1     |     2      |  3   |   4   |   5    |   6   |
| Transport   | Airplane |            |      |       |        | Trike |

From Clue 2, we know that the person driving the helicopter is to the right of the person driving the airplane. So, it must be in column 2 or 3.


From Clue 1, we know that the person driving the trike is on the right of the person driving the subway. Since the trike is already in column 6, the subway must be in one of the columns to its left (4 or 5).


Now, let's use Clue 3: The person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person driving the helicopter. This means that the taxi cannot be in column 1 (already occupied by the airplane) and it also cannot be in column 6 (already occupied by the trike). So, the taxi must be in one of the columns 2-5.


Considering all these constraints, we can try to fit the remaining transport modes:


* If the helicopter is in column 3, then the taxi would have to be in column 2 or 4. But this would leave no room for the subway and the train.
* So, let's put the helicopter in column 2.


Now, the table looks like this:


|             |    1     |     2      |  3   |   4   |   5    |   6   |
| Transport   | Airplane | Helicopter |      |       |        | Trike |

From Clue 3, we know that the taxi is on the left or right of the helicopter. Since the helicopter is already in column 2, the taxi must be in column 1 (no, it's already occupied by the airplane) or column 3.


Let's put the taxi in column 3:


|             |    1     |     2      |  3   |   4   |   5    |   6   |
| Transport   | Airplane | Helicopter | Taxi |       |        | Trike |

Now, we have two columns left to fill (4 and 5). We know that the subway is on the left of the trike, so it must be in column 4 or 5. The train can go in either column.


But wait! If the train were in column 4, then the subway would have to be in column 5, which would contradict Clue 1 (the person driving the trike is on the right of the person driving the subway).


So, let's put the train in column 5:


|             |    1     |     2      |  3   |   4   |   5    |   6   |
| Transport   | Airplane | Helicopter | Taxi | Subway| Train  | Trike |

Here is the final solution:


#############
|             |    1     |     2      |  3   |   4   |   5    |   6   |
| Transport   | Airplane | Helicopter | Taxi | Subway| Train  | Trike |

From clue 2, we know that Sports is on the right of Epic. We don't know their exact positions yet.


From clue 4, we know that Sports is on the left of Horror. This means that the order must be: ...Sports...Horror...

Now, let's try to place Epic and Sports. Since Sports is on the right of Epic (clue 2) and on the left of Horror (clue 4), we can deduce that the order is: ...Epic...Sports...Horror...


|               |   1    |     2      |  3   |   4    |   5    |    6    |

Lv3-1x6-7	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 4, we know that Volleyball is to the right of Lacrosse.

From clue 5 and 7, we know that Skiing is between Volleyball and Rugby (clue 3 also supports this).

From clue 6, we know that Skiing is to the left of Rugby.

So far, we have:

Lacrosse - ? - ? - Skiing - Volleyball - Rugby

From clue 2, we know that Golf is on either side of Water-Polo. And from clue 1, we know that Golf is between Rugby and Water-Polo. This means Golf must be to the right of Rugby.

Now we have:

Lacrosse - ? - ? - Skiing - Volleyball - Rugby - Golf

The only spot left for Water-Polo is to the right of Golf.

Lv3-1x6-8	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:

|       | bartender | scientist | engineer | police-officer | videographer | doctor |

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 2, we know the doctor is on the far right, so they must be in column 6.
* From clue 5, we know the bartender is to the left of the scientist. Since there are no other jobs between them, they must be in columns 1 and 2, respectively.
* From clue 4, we know the scientist is to the left of the engineer. This means the engineer must be in column 3.
* Now we have columns 1-3 filled: bartender, scientist, engineer.
* Clues 1 and 3 tell us that the doctor (column 6) and police-officer are on either side of the videographer. Since the doctor is already fixed in column 6, the police-officer must be to the left of the videographer. This means the videographer must be in column 5.
* Finally, we place the police-officer in column 4.
