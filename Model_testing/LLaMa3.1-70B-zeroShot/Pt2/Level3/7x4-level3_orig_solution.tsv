Lv3-7x4-2	"After solving the logic puzzle, I arrived at the following solution:


|               |       1       |     2      |     3      |    4     |

| Movie-Genre   | comedy        | disaster   | adventure  | thriller |
| Nationality   | indian        | mexican    | russian    | egyptian |
| Pet           | hedgehog      | guinea-pig | lizard     | snake    |
| Sport         | skateboarding | ice-hockey | swimming   | biathlon |

 

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* From clue 3, we know the person watching disaster movies is on the right of the Egyptian. Since the Egyptian can't be in position 1 (due to clue 16), they must be in position 4.
* Clue 8 tells us the teacher eats peach, and from clue 14, we know eggplant is on the far right. This means peach must be in position 2 or 3.
* Clue 9 indicates that grapes are between the Mexican and skateboarding. Since skateboarding can't be in position 1 (due to clue 5), this means the Mexican must be in position 2 or 3, and grapes in position 1.
* From clue 10, we know the chef is on the left of the nurse. This means cher (in position 1) can't be the chef, so they must be a different job (maybe manager?).
* Clue 11 tells us the lizard is on the right of the hedgehog, and from clue 6, we know the hedgehog is on the far left or right. This means the hedgehog is in position 1.
* Now that we have some pieces in place, let's look at clue 4: the person watching adventure movies eats raspberry. From clue 7, we know disaster movies are on the left of raspberry. Since disaster movies can't be in position 1 (due to clue 3), this means adventure movies must be in position 3.
* Clue 5 indicates that skateboarding is on the left of ice-hockey. This means skateboarding can only be in positions 1 or 2, and since it's already determined to be with grapes, it must be in position 1. Ice-hockey then goes to position 2.
* From clue 13, we know milk is biathlon. Clue 12 tells us lemonade is on the left or right of guinea-pig. Since lemonade can't be in position 4 (due to clue 1), it must be in positions 2 or 3.
* At this point, most pieces are in place. We just need to figure out fanta and tea. Clue 15 says the Indian is on the left of fanta. Since we already have an Indian in position 1 (due to clue 9), fanta must be in position 2. This leaves tea for position 3.
* The remaining piece, snake, goes to the last empty spot.

Lv3-7x4-4	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a possible solution for the logic puzzle:


|               |     1     |       2        |      3      |      4       |

| Pet           | frog      | rabbit        | pony        | rat          |

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


1. From clue 18, we know that the person who's hobby is fishing is on the far left, so they must be in column 1.
2. Clue 5 tells us that the person watching zombie movies is the security-guard, and from clue 4, we know the fan of country is on the left or right of the owner of the pony. Since the security-guard can't be in column 1 (because of the fishing hobby), they must be in column 3.
3. Clue 19 tells us that the person watching western movies is on the left of the journalist, so the western movie fan must be in column 2 or 3. However, since column 3 is already occupied by the security-guard, the western movie fan must be in column 2.
4. From clue 9, we know that the person who's hobby is video-games is the person watching western movies, so the video-game hobbyist must also be in column 2.
5. Clue 8 tells us that the person eating pear is on the right of the person eating artichoke, and since the artichoke eater can't be in column 4 (because it's occupied by the watermelon eater), they must be in column 1 or 2. Let's assume the artichoke eater is in column 1 for now.
6. Clue 10 tells us that the owner of the rabbit is on the left of the person watching horror movies, and from clue 14, we know the owner of the rabbit is on the right of the owner of the frog. This means the frog owner must be in column 1 or 2. Since column 1 is already occupied by the fishing hobbyist (who can't own a frog), the frog owner must be in column 2.
7. Clue 16 tells us that the person drinking sprite is on the left of the fan of r&b, so the sprite drinker must be in column 1 or 2. Let's assume they're in column 2 for now.
8. From clue 6, we know the fan of techno is on the left of the owner of the frog, so the techno fan must be in column 1 (since the frog owner is in column 2).
9. Clue 15 tells us that the person drinking water is on the right of the fan of rock, and from clue 7, we know they're also on the far left or far right. Since the fan of rock can't be in column 1 (because it's occupied by the techno fan), the rock fan must be in column 2 or 3.
10. Clue 12 tells us that the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the far left or far right, and from clue 13, we know they're also not drinking water (since it's on the far left or far right). This means the magic-trick hobbyist must be in column 4.
11. Clue 3 tells us that the security-guard is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is fishing, so the security-guard can't be in column 1 (since it's occupied by the fishing hobbyist). Therefore, the security-guard must be in column 3, and the journalist must be in column 4.
12. Clue 11 tells us that the person eating watermelon is on the far right, which confirms our earlier assumption.

With these deductions, we can fill in the rest of the table:


|               |     1     |       2        |      3      |      4       |

Please note that the rules are applied step by step, and each row is filled in accordingly. The solution table shows the final arrangement of all the attributes for each person.


Here's a brief explanation of how the rules were applied:


* Rule 4 places the coach on the far left.
* Rule 19 places the Turkish on either the far left or far right, but since the coach is already on the far left, the Turkish must be on the far right. However, rule 6 states that the Turkish owns the turtle, and rule 12 says the turtle's owner is next to the quad-bike driver (lemonade drinker). This means the Turkish cannot be on the far right, so they must be placed in position 1.
* Rule 18 places the Indian, who drinks 7up, in position 4.
* Rule 2 places the Pakistani to the left of the Indian.
* Rule 11 places the subway driver (who is not drinking water) to the left of the fisherman. Since the coach is already on the far left, this means the subway driver must be in position 3 or 4. However, rule 16 says the fisherman is next to the subway driver, and rule 8 states that the fisherman plays rugby. This places the fisherman in position 4 (next to the Indian) and the subway driver in position 3.
* Rule 5 places the scooter driver (who drinks water) to the right of the water drinker. Since the water drinker cannot be in position 1 (Turkish), they must be in position 2, and the scooter driver must be in position 1 or 3. However, rule 4 already placed the coach on the far left, so the water drinker must be in position 1.
* Rule 10 places the rock fan next to the blues fan. Since rule 15 states that the blues fan is between the punk fan and the soccer player, this means the rock fan must be in either position 2 or 3. However, rule 17 says the rock fan is next to the entrepreneur, who cannot be in position 1 (coach). This places the rock fan in position 3.
* Rule 15 states that the blues fan is between the punk fan and the soccer player. Since rule 13 says the salsa fan is next to the soccer player, this means the blues fan must be in position 2 or 3. However, rule 10 already placed the rock fan next to the blues fan, so the blues fan must be in position 2.
* Rule 1 places the milk drinker to the left of the skateboarding enthusiast.
* Rule 7 states that the cat owner is next to the mouse owner. Since rule 14 says the frog owner is next to the Turkish, this means the cat and mouse owners must be in positions 3 or 4.
* The remaining attributes can now be filled in accordingly.


This solution satisfies all the given rules and constraints."

| Transport     | bike     | train     | subway           | tram         |

Let me explain the steps I took to solve this puzzle:

From clue 1, we know that tea is on the far left. From clue 3, we know that french is also on the far left. 

From clue 6, we know that epic movies are watched by someone on the right of the person drinking tea.

From clue 16, we know that disaster movies are watched by someone on the far left. This must be the same person as in clue 1 and 3.

From clue 2, we know that sailing is either on the far left or far right. Since the far left is already taken by the french person drinking tea and watching disaster movies, sailing must be on the far right.

From clue 7, we know that biathlon is on the left or right of fantasy movies. But from clue 12, we know that biathlon is actually on the right of fantasy movies.

From clue 17, we know that software-developer is on the right of cola. 

From clue 18, we know that tram is either on the far left or far right. Since the far left and far right are already taken by bike (clue 11) and sailing, this means that tram must be in column 4.

From clue 8, we know that lizard is owned by someone who drives a tram. This means that lizard must also be in column 4.

From clue 14, we know that the lawyer is on the right of the owner of the dog. 

From clue 15, we know that british is on the left of the owner of the dog. Since british cannot be on the far right (where sailing is), this means that dog must be in column 4 and british must be in column 3.

From clue 10, we know that water is on the left of horse. 

Since epic movies are watched by someone on the right of the person drinking tea (clue 6), and biathlon is on the right of fantasy movies (clue 12), this means that epic must be in column 2.

From clue 13, we know that software-developer is either on the left or right of bike. Since bike is on the far left (clue 11) and software-developer is also on the right of cola (clue 17), this means that software-developer must be in column 2.

The rest of the puzzle can be solved by combining these deductions with the remaining clues.

| Transport     | bus          | snowmobile   | ship         | quad-bike |

Here's a brief explanation of the steps to solve this puzzle:


Step 1: We start by applying rule 4, which states that ""the analyst is the owner of the turtle"". This gives us an initial starting point for column 1.

Column 1:
|               |      1       |
| Beverage      |              |
| Food          |              |
| Job           | analyst      |
| Movie-Genre   |              |

| Pet           | turtle       |
| Transport     |              |

Step 2: Next, we apply rule 8, which states that ""the person drinking water is on the right of the owner of the turtle"". This places the beverage in column 1.

Column 1:
|               |      1       |
| Beverage      | water        |
| Food          |              |
| Job           | analyst      |
| Movie-Genre   |              |
| Nationality   |              |
| Pet           | turtle       |
| Transport     |              |

Step 3: Then, we apply rule 5, which states that ""the british is on the right of the analyst"". This places the nationality in column 2.

Column 1 & 2:
|               |      1       |       2       |
| Beverage      | water        |              |
| Food          |              |              |
| Job           | analyst      |              |
| Movie-Genre   |              |              |
| Nationality   |              | british      |
| Pet           | turtle       |              |
| Transport     |              |              |

Step 4: Next, we apply rule 12, which states that ""the person driving the bus is on the left or right of the british"". This places the transport in column 1.

Column 1 & 2:
|               |      1       |       2       |
| Beverage      | water        |              |
| Food          |              |              |
| Job           | analyst      |              |
| Movie-Genre   |              |              |
| Nationality   |              | british      |
| Pet           | turtle       |              |
| Transport     | bus          |              |

Step 5: Then, we apply rule 13, which states that ""the brazilian is the person drinking 7up"". This places the beverage and nationality in column 2.

Column 1 & 2:

| Transport     | bus          |              |

Step 6: Next, we apply rule 14, which states that ""the person drinking 7up is the owner of the bird"". This places the pet in column 2.

Column 1 & 2:
|               |      1       |       2       |
| Beverage      | water        | 7up          |

| Transport     | bus          |              |

Step 7: Then, we apply rule 11, which states that ""the person eating peas is the owner of the bird"". This places the food in column 2.

Column 1 & 2:
|               |      1       |       2       |
| Beverage      | water        | 7up          |

| Transport     | bus          |              |

Step 8: Next, we apply rule 3, which states that ""the teacher is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile"". This places the job in column 2.

Column 1 & 2:
|               |      1       |       2       |
| Beverage      | water        | 7up          |

| Pet           | turtle       | bird         |
| Transport     | bus          | snowmobile |

Step 9: Then, we apply rule 2, which states that ""the person driving the quad-bike is the owner of the dog"". This places the pet and transport in column 4.

Column 1 & 2 & 3 & 4:
|               |      1       |       2       |     3      |     4     |
| Beverage      | water        | 7up          |            |           |
| Food          |              | peas         |            |           |

| Transport     | bus          | snowmobile   | ship      | quad-bike |

Step 10: Finally, we apply the remaining rules to fill in the rest of the table.


|               |      1       |       2       |     3      |     4     |

Lv3-7x4-9	"Here is the solved puzzle:


|               |      1      |     2      |      3      |      4       |
| Beverage      | mirinda    | almond-milk| 7up         | milk          |
| Hobby         | camping    | baking     | board-games | video-games   |
| Movie-Genre   | martial-art| epic        | action       | drama         |
| Music-Genre   | gospel     | ambient    | disco        | classical     |
| Nationality   | nigerian  | spanish    | german       | turkish       |

| Transport     | airplane   | tram        | bike         | taxi          |

Note:

* From clue 18, martial-arts must be at either end. But from clue 4, action is next to ambient, so martial-arts can't be on the right (as classical is already there). So martial-arts is on the left.
* From clue 12, epic is between camping and turkish. Also, from clue 11, mirinda drinks epic movies. And from clue 14, baking is on the left of epic. So, we have a sequence: ..., camping, baking, epic, ...
* From clue 8, spanish is on the left of baking.
* From clue 16, board-games is next to action (as they are the only two options for '...' in ...action...).
* From clue 6, ferret is on the left of camping.
* From clue 9, almond-milk drinks cat. And from clue 13, gospel drives bike.
* The rest can be filled in using the remaining clues.

Please let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any step!"
Lv3-7x4-10	"After analyzing the given clues, I've come up with a possible solution for the logic puzzle:


|               |     1      |       2       |     3      |    4     |
| Beverage      | mirinda    | water         | lemonade   | juice    |
| Hobby         | filmmaking | drawing        | baking     | fishing  |
| Movie-Genre   | martial-arts| romance        | action      | western   |
| Music-Genre   | punk       | folk           | metal       | d&b       |
| Pet           | turtle     | bird           | cat          | goat      |
| Sport         | handball   | skateboarding  | rugby       | swimming  |
| Transport     | quad-bike  | skateboard     | van          | train     |

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

* Clue 7 tells us that the person driving the train is on the far right, so we can start by placing ""train"" in column 4.
* Clue 20 tells us that the person driving the van is drinking juice, and since they're not on the far right (clue 7), they must be in column 3. This also means that ""juice"" goes in column 3 or 4.
* Clue 1 says that the person drinking water is to the right of the person drinking juice. Since ""van"" and ""juice"" are already placed, we can put ""water"" in column 2.
* Clue 13 tells us that the fan of folk is drinking lemonade, which must be in either column 1 or 3 (clue 5). We'll place it in column 3 for now.
* Clues 19 and 6 tell us that the owner of the goat is doing rugby, which is also done by the person drinking lemonade. Since ""lemonade"" is already placed in column 3, we can put ""rugby"" in column 3 as well.
* ...and so on.

Please note that this solution might not be unique, and there could be other possible arrangements that satisfy all the clues.
