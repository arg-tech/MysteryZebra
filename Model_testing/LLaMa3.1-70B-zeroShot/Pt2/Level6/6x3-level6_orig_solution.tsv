| Nationality   | chinese   | canadian   | spanish     |

#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:

From clue 10, we know that Chinese is on the left of Electrician. From clue 6, we know that Hiking is on the far right, so Electrician must be in position 2.

Clue 9 tells us that Entrepreneur is between Funk and Spanish. Since Electrician is already in position 2, Entrepreneur must be in position 1 or 3. But from clue 4, we know that Sudoku is next to Gospel, which means Entrepreneur can't be in position 1. So Entrepreneur must be in position 2, but this contradicts our earlier conclusion. Therefore, Entrepreneur must be in position 3.

From clue 9 again, Funk must be on the left of Entrepreneur (in position 2), and Spanish must be on the right (in position 3). But from clue 5, we know that Family movies is not Lemonade, which means Scientific movies (from clue 7) must be in position 2. This also fits with clue 1, which says Journalist is in an odd position.

From clue 8, Hip-Hop must be on the right of Lemonade, so Hip-Hop is in position 3. From clue 4, Sudoku and Gospel are next to each other. Since Funk is already in position 2, Sudoku and Gospel must be in positions 1 and 2 (in some order). But from clue 2, we know that Juice is in the middle, so Sudoku must be in position 1.

Now we can fill in the remaining gaps: Lemonade is in position 3, Hiking is in position 3, and Tea is in position 1. Finally, Canadian is the only nationality left, which fits perfectly into position 2.

Lv6-6x3-2	"After solving the logic puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


|               |      1      |     2      |       3       |
| Beverage      | tea         | 7up        | mirinda      |

| Pet           | chinchilla  | cat        | bird         |
| Sport         | surfing     | skateboarding| baseball     |


Let me explain the step-by-step reasoning:

From clue 5, we know that the person who's sport is surfing is on the far left. From clue 7, we know that the person drinking tea is on the left of the person who's hobby is drawing. Therefore, the person drinking tea must be in position 1.

From clue 6, we know that the person drinking 7up is in the middle. Since there are only three positions, this means that the person drinking 7up must be in position 2.

From clue 3, we know that the japanese is on the right of the person who's hobby is board-games. But since the person drinking tea is already in position 1, and their hobby can't be board-games (because then the japanese would have to be in a non-existent position 0), the person with the hobby board-games must be in position 2.

From clue 4, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is the egyptian. From clue 2, we know that the owner of the bird is somewhere to the left of the lawyer. Since the person drinking mirinda (in position 3) can't have a hobby other than drawing or photography (because then their nationality would be ambiguous), and since the person with the hobby board-games is already in position 2, the person with the hobby drawing must be in position 3.

From clue 8, we know that the nurse is on the right of the person who's hobby is drawing. But since the person drinking tea (in position 1) can't have a job other than nurse or lawyer (because then their nationality would be ambiguous), and since the person with the hobby board-games (in position 2) already has an assigned job, the nurse must be in position 1.

From clue 9, we know that the electrician is not the person who's sport is baseball. Since the person drinking mirinda (in position 3) can't have a job other than lawyer or electrician (because then their nationality would be ambiguous), and since the person with the hobby drawing (in position 3) already has an assigned job, the electrician must be in position 2.

From clue 1, we know that the malaysian is in an odd position. But since the japanese is already in position 1, and since there are only three positions, this means that the malaysian must be in position 3.

Finally, from clue 10, we know that the owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the owner of the cat. Since the person with the hobby photography (in position 1) can't have a pet other than bird or chinchilla (because then their nationality would be ambiguous), and since the person drinking mirinda (in position 3) already has an assigned pet, the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 1.

The final solution is:

Lv6-6x3-3	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a solution for the logic puzzle:

| Sport         | cycling    | handball  | volleyball  |
| Transport     | subway     | tram      | quad-bike   |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 3, we know that the person who likes cycling is on the left or right of the person who likes handball. Since there are only three positions, the person who likes cycling must be in either position 1 or 3.

Clue 9 tells us that the person who likes handball is to the left of the person whose hobby is filmmaking. This means that the person who likes handball cannot be in position 3 (since there's no one to their right). Therefore, the person who likes handball must be in position 2.

Now we can use clue 1 to determine that the person whose hobby is drawing is in an odd position. Since the only remaining odd position is 1, this person must be in position 1. From clue 8, we know that the person who likes fishing is to the left of the person watching epic movies. This means that the person who likes fishing must be in position 3.

The rest of the clues can be used to fill in the remaining gaps:

* Clue 11 tells us that the person who likes handball is on the left or right of the person watching thriller movies. Since the person who likes handball is in position 2, this means that the person watching thriller movies must be in position 1 (i.e., drawing).
* Clue 7 tells us that the person driving the tram is between the person watching thriller movies and the person driving the quad-bike. This means that the person driving the tram must be in position 2 (i.e., handball), and the person watching thriller movies is indeed in position 1.
* Clue 10 tells us that the dancer is between the person driving the quad-bike and the bartender. Since the person driving the quad-bike is in position 3, this means that the dancer must be in position 2 (i.e., handball), and the bartender is indeed in position 1.
* Clue 12 tells us that the bartender is to the left of the person watching disaster movies. This means that the bartender must be in position 1 (i.e., drawing).
* Clue 5 tells us that the police-officer is not a fan of soul music. Since there's no other job available for the person who likes funk, this means that the police-officer must like funk music.
* Clue 2 and clue 6 tell us that the fan of house music is not the person who likes handball or volleyball. This means that the fan of house music must be in position 3 (i.e., fishing).

The final solution table shows all these relationships satisfied."
Lv6-6x3-4	"After analyzing the given clues, I've constructed the solution table as follows:


|               |     1     |    2     |     3     |
| Beverage      | mirinda   | soy-milk | coffee    |

| Hobby         | cycling   | reading  | sudoku    |
| Movie-Genre   | musical   | adventure| animation |
| Pet           | hamster   | goldfish | fish      |
| Sport         | hiking    | surfing  | baseball  |

#############


Here's a brief explanation of the deductions:

From clue 4, we know coffee is to the right of mirinda. From clue 11, musical movies are paired with grapes. Since reading is not adventure (clue 10), and adventure is not surfing (clue 2), reading must be paired with animation or musical, but since musical is already taken by grapes, it's paired with adventure.

Using clues 5 and 7, we can deduce that cycling and hiking are the leftmost hobbies. Clue 1 tells us artichoke is to the left of reading, which places artichoke on the first column.

Clue 9 says baseball is to the right of hiking, placing hiking in either column 1 or 2. Since cycling is also on the left (clue 7), it must be paired with hiking. Clue 6 says soy-milk's pet is not a fish, so hamster must be its owner.

The remaining columns fall into place by process of elimination and applying the given clues.


Please let me know if this solution satisfies all the conditions!"
Lv6-6x3-5	"I'll start by analyzing the clues and filling in the table accordingly.


From clue 5, we know that the nurse is in an even position, so it must be either person 2 or person 3 (not person 1, since there's no person 4).

From clue 6, we also know that the person who's sport is biathlon is in an even position. This could be the same person as the nurse, but we don't know yet.

From clue 7, we know that the indonesian is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since there are only three people, this means that the indonesian must be either person 1 or person 3.

Now let's look at clues 2 and 4 together. We know that the person watching western movies is somewhere to the left of the journalist (clue 2), and that the person watching documentary movies is between the person watching sports movies and the indonesian (clue 4). This means that the order must be: [sports movies], [documentary movies], [western movies]. We also know that the indonesian can't be in position 1, because then there wouldn't be anyone to the left of them for the documentary movie fan. Therefore, the indonesian is person 3.

From clue 9, we know that the russian is not the person watching sports movies.


Now let's look at clues 1 and 10 together. We know that the fan classical is on the far left or far right (clue 1), and that the fan r&b is on the far left or far right (clue 10). Since there can't be two people on the far left, this means that one of these fans must be person 1 and the other must be person 3.

Let's make a few educated guesses to see if we can fill in more information.


Suppose the fan classical is person 1. Then from clue 3, we know that the fan r&b must be either person 2 or person 3. But then from clue 10, we'd have two people competing for the far left and far right spots, which doesn't work.


Therefore, it's more likely that the fan classical is person 3, and the fan r&b is person 1.

From clue 8, we know that the person who's hobby is board-games is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is basketball. Since there are only three people, this means that the person with board-games as their hobby must be either person 1 or person 2.


Now let's put it all together!


We can try a few different possibilities and see what works:


What if person 1 has r&b music and rock-climbing? Then from clue 8, person 2 would have to have board-games as their hobby. From clue 6, person 2 could be the biathlete.


Then we'd have:


|               |      1      |      2      |       3       |
| Hobby         | rock-climbing| board-games | dancing       |
| Job           |             |             |               |
| Movie-Genre   |             |             |               |
| Music-Genre   | r&b          |             | classical     |
| Nationality   |             |             |               |
| Sport         |             | biathlon    |               |

But then we'd have to figure out the rest of it!


What if person 1 has r&b music and dancing? Then from clue 8, person 2 would still have board-games as their hobby. From clue 6, person 2 could be the biathlete.


Then we'd have:


|               |      1      |      2      |       3       |
| Hobby         | dancing     | board-games | rock-climbing |
| Job           |             |             |               |
| Movie-Genre   |             |             |               |
| Music-Genre   | r&b          |             | classical     |
| Nationality   |             |             |               |
| Sport         |             | biathlon    |               |

From clue 7, we know that the indonesian is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Therefore, the indonesian must be either person 1 or person 2 doesn't work (because then they'd have to be in position 3). So the indonesian must be person 3.


Then we can try filling in some more information:


We know that the nurse is in an even position (clue 5), so it could still be either person 2 or person 3. But since the biathlete is also in an even position (clue 6), this means that these two must actually be the same person!


From clue 4, we know that the person watching documentary movies is between the person watching sports movies and the indonesian.


Now let's put it all together!


Here's our final solution:


|               |      1      |      2      |       3       |

#############


Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

From clue 1, we know the Australian is into golf. From clue 2 and 3, we can deduce that the person who likes sudoku is also the fan of techno music. Clue 5 tells us the American is the fan of techno music, so the American must be on the far left (clue 12). 

Clue 6 places the social-worker on the far left or far right, but since the American is already on the far left, the social-worker must be on the far right.

From clue 4, we know the scientist is to the right of the person who likes golf. Clue 8 tells us the scientist is not American, so the scientist must be in column 3 (Australian). 

Clue 9 places the fan of electronic music on either side of the Australian. Since the American is already on the far left, the fan of electronic music must be in column 1.

From clue 10 and 11, we can deduce that the person who likes collecting is to the left of the fisherman, and the person who likes sudoku is to the right of the fan of electronic music. This places the collector on the far left (American) and the sudoku enthusiast on the far right (column 3).

Clue 13 tells us the person who likes puzzles also likes swimming. Since the Australian is already accounted for, this must be in column 1.

The rest of the clues help to fill in the remaining gaps, resulting in the above solution."
Lv6-6x3-7	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with the following solution:

| Transport     |          |           |                |
 
Here's the step-by-step explanation:

From clue 2, we know the person driving the boat is in an odd position. This means it can be either column 1 or 3.

From clue 10, we know the tram driver is between the adventure movie fan and the disaster movie fan. Since there are only two positions left ( columns 1 & 2), this means the tram driver must be in column 2.

Now, from clue 9, we know the person watching adventure movies owns a goat. This can't be column 2 since it's taken by the tram driver. Therefore, the adventure movie fan is in either column 1 or 3.

However, from clue 6, we know the techno fan is on the left of the jazz fan, and the jazz fan is on the left of the police-officer. This means the techno fan can't be in column 3 (since there's no one to their right). Hence, the adventure movie fan must be in column 1.

Now, from clue 11, we know the goat owner isn't a techno fan. So, the person watching adventure movies and owning a goat is not a techno fan. But they can be either an engineer or police-officer (since the analyst hasn't been ruled out for this position).

Let's move to column 3: from clue 8, we know the lacrosse fan isn't watching superhero movies. Since there are two options left for the movie genre (disaster and superhero), one of these must be in column 3.

However, from clue 7, we know the jazz fan is on the left of the police-officer. This means the jazz fan can't be in column 3 (since there's no one to their right). Hence, the lacrosse fan is not watching superhero movies and must be watching disaster movies.

From clue 4, we know the engineer is to the right of the lacrosse fan. Since the lacrosse fan is in column 3, this means the engineer can't be in column 1 (since there's no one to their left). Therefore, the engineer must be in column 2.

However, from clue 10, we already determined that column 2 belongs to the tram driver. This means the person watching disaster movies is actually the analyst.

From clue 5, we know the police-officer isn't a jazz fan. Since the techno fan is on the left of the jazz fan (clue 6), and the jazz fan is on the left of the police-officer, this means the engineer can be either a techno or trance fan.

However, from clue 1, we know the goat owner watches adventure movies and plays soccer. Since column 1 is taken by the adventure movie fan, this means they must also play soccer.

Now, let's put everything together:

* From clue 1, we know the electrician owns the mouse.
* From clue 2, we know the person who likes soccer is between the pilot and social-worker.
* From clue 8, we know the hamster owner is on the far right.
* Using clues 3 and 4, we can deduce that the satire movie fan is in position 2.
* Clue 6 tells us that the funk music fan is between the weightlifting enthusiast and comedy movie fan. Since the electrician (mouse owner) is to the right of the rowing enthusiast (clue 7), the electrician must be in position 2, which means the satire movie fan is also in position 2.
* Clue 9 tells us that the techno music fan is to the right of the snowmobile driver. Since the motorbike driver is to the right of the bike driver (clue 10), and the bike driver can't be on the far right (since the hamster owner is there), the bike driver must be in position 1.
* Clue 11 tells us that the mouse owner (electrician) is on the left or right of the social-worker. Since the electrician is already in position 2, the social-worker must be in position 3.
* With these deductions, we can fill in the remaining blanks to get the final solution.

####################

Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 3, we know that the person watching musical movies is on the far right (position 3).
From clue 11, we know that the person who's sport is rugby is on the far right (position 3). Therefore, the person watching musical movies and playing rugby must be the same person.

Clue 2 tells us that the person whose hobby is drawing is to the right of the person watching sports movies. Since the person watching musical movies is already on the far right, the person watching sports movies cannot be in position 3. Therefore, they must be in either position 1 or 2.

From clue 9, we know that the person watching disaster movies is in an odd position (either 1 or 3). If they were in position 3, it would contradict with the fact that the person watching musical movies and playing rugby is already there. Therefore, the person watching disaster movies must be in position 1.

Now, let's look at the music genres:

Clue 4 tells us that the fan of folk is to the left of the person who plays rugby (position 3). This means that the fan of folk must be in either position 1 or 2. Since we already know that the person watching disaster movies is in position 1, and they cannot watch musicals (clue 3), it's likely that the fan of folk is in position 1.

From clue 7, we know that the fan of r&b is on either side of the person driving the airplane. Since the person driving the airplane must be to the right of the fan salsa (clue 12), and the fan salsa cannot be in position 3, it's likely that the fan of salsa is in position 2.

Now let's look at the hobbies:

From clue 8, we know that the person whose hobby is gardening is on either side of the person eating garlic. We already have a possible candidate for position 1 (fan of folk and watching disaster movies). This means that the person whose hobby is gardening might be in position 2.

However, this would contradict with clue 1, which states that the person whose hobby is gardening is not a fan of r&b. Since we don't know if the fan of salsa likes gardening or not (but it's possible), let's look at other clues:

From clue 10, we know that the person whose hobby is skydiving is to the right of the person driving the ship. If the person driving the ship were in position 2, this would mean that there's no space for the person whose hobby is skydiving (as position 3 is already taken by the person watching musical movies and playing rugby).

Therefore, the person driving the ship must be in position 1 or 2. We already have a possible candidate for position 1 (fan of folk and watching disaster movies). This means that the person whose hobby is gardening might actually be in position 1.

From clue 5, we know that the person eating pineapple drives the subway, which must be in either position 2 or 3 (since the airplane is already occupied by someone who plays rugby).

This means that the fan of salsa, the person watching sports movies, and the person driving the ship are likely to be in positions 1 and 2.

Considering all these constraints and deductions, I came up with a possible solution:

Lv6-6x3-10	"Here is the solved logic puzzle:


|               |     1     |      2      |    3     |
| Beverage      | tea       | almond-milk | iced-tea |
| Job           | fisherman | musician    | lawyer   |
| Music-Genre   | rock      | trance      | classical|
| Nationality   | polish    | french      | canadian |
| Pet           | ferret    | rat         | fish     |
| Transport     | helicopter| ship        | jet-ski  |

The solution was derived by carefully applying the given clues:


From clue 7, we know the polish is on the right of the fisherman. Since there are only three columns, this means the polish must be in column 2 or 3.


From clue 4, we know the polish person drives a helicopter, so they must be in column 1 (since helicopters are not typically used for short-distance travel).


Now that we have the polish person's position, we can use clue 6 to place the french person. The fan of trance music is somewhere to the right of the french, and since the polish person drives a helicopter, the french must be in column 2 or 3.


From clue 10, we know the french person is also a rock music fan, so they must be in column 1 (since rock music fans are already accounted for in columns 2 and 3).


However, this conflicts with our earlier conclusion that the polish person is in column 1. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the clues.


From clue 8, we know the lawyer is on the right of the musician. This means the lawyer must be in either column 2 or 3, and the musician must be in either column 1 or 2.


We can use this information to place the polish person again. From clue 7, we know the polish person is on the right of the fisherman. If the polish person were in column 2, then the fisherman would have to be in column 1, but this would leave no room for the musician (who must be in either column 1 or 2). Therefore, the polish person must be in column 3.


Now that we have the polish person's position, we can use clue 5 to place the person drinking almond-milk. This person is somewhere to the left of the jet-ski driver, so they must be in column 1 or 2.


From clue 9, we know the person drinking tea is on the right of the owner of the ferret. Since the polish person drives a helicopter and is already accounted for, the owner of the ferret must be in column 1 or 2.


However, if the owner of the ferret were in column 1, then the person drinking tea would have to be in column 2 or 3, which conflicts with our earlier conclusion that the polish person is in column 3. Therefore, the owner of the ferret must be in column 2.


Now we can use clue 1 to place the person drinking almond-milk. This person is on the right of the owner of the fish, but since the owner of the ferret is already in column 2, this means the person drinking almond-milk must be in column 3 (but we've already established that the polish person is in column 3).


However, if the person drinking almond-milk were not in column 3, then clue 1 would place them on the right of the owner of the fish. Given our previous conclusions about columns 2 and 3 being accounted for by the french and polish people respectively, it means that both the owner of the ferret AND the person drinking almond milk cannot be placed based solely on these clues - which forces us to go back to clue 5 again:


the person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the left of the person driving the jet-ski.


This clue now indicates that since the polish person must drive a helicopter and the polish drives on the right hand side, then this means the person who drinks almond milk MUST be in column 2, with only one position available for transport - which would have to be ship!


With these placements, we can use the remaining clues to fill in the rest of the table:


The person drinking tea must be on the right of the owner of the ferret (clue 9), so they must be in column 1.


The fan of trance music is somewhere to the right of the french (clue 6), so they must be in column 2 or 3. However, since the polish person drives a helicopter and the french person is already accounted for, this means the fan of trance music must be in column 3.


Finally, the owner of the rat is somewhere to the right of the polish (clue 3), but since the polish person is in column 1, this means the owner of the rat must be in either column 2 or 3. However, since the person drinking almond-milk is already in column 2, this means the owner of the rat must be in column 3.


With these final placements, we can complete the table as shown above:


|               |     1     |      2      |    3     |
| Beverage      | tea       | almond-milk | iced-tea |
| Job           | fisherman | musician    | lawyer   |
| Music-Genre   | rock      | trance      | classical|
| Nationality   | polish    | french      | canadian |
| Pet           | ferret    | rat         | fish     |
| Transport     | helicopter| ship        | jet-ski  |
