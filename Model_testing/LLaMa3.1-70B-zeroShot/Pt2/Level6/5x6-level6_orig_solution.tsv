Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* Conditions 1-5 give us some initial constraints on the positions of certain individuals.
* Condition 6 tells us that the owner of the chinchilla is not driving the scooter.
* Conditions 7-10 provide more information about the relative positions of certain individuals.
* Condition 11 rules out one possibility for the owner of the horse.
* Condition 12 places the fan of trance on the right of the owner of the horse.
* Conditions 13-18 give us further constraints on the positions of various individuals.
* Condition 19 tells us that the person driving the boat is not the owner of the dog.
* Conditions 20-22 provide more information about the relative positions of certain individuals.
* Condition 23 places the person eating avocado on the left of the person whose sport is handball.
* Condition 24 gives us a constraint on the position of the person eating apricot.
* Conditions 25-32 give us further constraints and rule out some possibilities.
* Condition 33 tells us that the owner of the ferret is on the left of the person driving the boat.
* Condition 34 identifies the owner of the ferret as the person eating cauliflower.

Note: The positions are numbered from 1 to 6, with 1 being the leftmost position.


Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:


I started by using clues 11 and 12 to determine that the person watching sports movies is in an even position (4) and the person watching documentary movies is in an odd position. Clue 22 then told me that the person eating peas is also the one watching documentary movies.


From clue 8, I knew that the person watching family movies is to the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since the person watching sports movies is in position 4 (clue 11), the person watching family movies must be in either position 1 or 2.


Clues 20 and 21 helped me determine the order of the hobbies, with video-games to the left of drawing, and baking not being in an even position. Clue 24 told me that the american is drinking fanta, so I could place them in position 6.


I continued using the clues to narrow down the possibilities and eventually arrived at the solution above.

| Pet           | ferret    | snake       | guinea-pig    | rabbit     | bird         | horse       |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

From clues 3, 10, and 15, we can determine that the manager is not in positions 1, 2, or 5. Clue 16 indicates that the person drinking iced-tea is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5). From clue 22, we know the person watching comedy movies is not in position 4. Combining this with clues 19 and 27, we can determine that the photographer is watching comedy movies and is in position 2.

Clue 32 tells us that the architect owns a guinea-pig, and from clue 5, the owner of the snake is to the left of the guinea-pig. This means the snake's owner must be in position 3 or 4 (but not 4 because it would conflict with clue 14). Since the person watching family movies is on the right of the ferret (clue 21), and the ferret is not watching western movies (clue 18), we can determine that the architect (guinea-pig owner) is in position 3.

From clues 2, 6, and 20, we know that the fan indie is to the right of almond-milk and to the left of metal. Clues 7 and 13 tell us that house is on the far right and classical is the photographer (who watches comedy movies). Clue 8 tells us that classical (photographer) is somewhere to the right of the bird owner.

Clue 9 states that tea is the bartender's drink, which must be in position 5 since it also corresponds with zombie movies (clue 11). The manager is on the left of horror movies (clue 15), and family movies are not watched by salsa fans (clue 31). Since the teacher is on the left or right of hot-chocolate (clue 26) and not coffee (clue 25), we can determine that hot-chocolate must be in position 3, which means tea is in position 5.

The rest of the puzzle falls into place using similar logical deductions."
