| Nationality   | japanese | american | italian   | argentine| canadian  | british| indian      |

Here's the explanation of how I solved it:

From clue 23, we know that lettuce is on the far left. 
From clue 26, almond-milk is Japanese, and from clue 5, Japanese is either on the far left or far right, but since lettuce is already on the far left, Japanese must be on the far right (column 7). From clue 25, country is artichoke.
From clue 28, reggae is next to fanta. 
From clue 2, blues is on the left of reggae, so the order is: blues-reggae-fanta.
From clue 3, reggae is somewhere to the left of metal, and from clue 14, fanta is not metal, so the order is: blues-reggae-fanta-metal.
From clue 16, indian is on the left of artichoke. 
From clue 1, italian is on the left of reggae. 
From clue 24, soy-milk is next to italian.
From clue 27, techno is not italian, and from clue 8, garlic is on the right of techno. From clue 22, metal is next to garlic. So, the order is: techno-garlic-metal.
From clue 4, artichoke is on the right of indian.
From clue 12, argentine is between canadian and orange. 
From clue 15, canadian is on the left of orange.
From clue 20, trance is not italian, but from clue 13, trance is on the left of indian.
So, the order for nationality is: japanese (7), american (2), british (6), italian (3), argentine (4), canadian (5), and indian (left of artichoke).
The rest can be filled in using the remaining clues.

.


Here's a brief explanation of the solution process:

* From clue 14, nectarine is on the far left or far right. Since mango (clue 29) and nectarine are next to each other, and mango can't be on the far left (due to ambient being in position 1, as deduced from clues 6 and 12), nectarine must be on the far left.
* From clue 17, satire is next to nectarine. Since western (clue 28) and drama (clue 25) are next to each other, and western can't be in position 2 (due to ambient being in position 1), western must be in position 1.
* From clue 11, basketball is the person watching thriller movies. From clue 31, tennis is the person watching horror movies.
* The rest of the solution follows from a combination of the remaining clues.

Please note that this is one possible solution, and there might be other valid solutions depending on the interpretation of some clues.


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


* Clues 1 and 17 together imply that the person driving the taxi is also the writer.
* Clue 5 implies that the board-games enthusiast is either on the far left or far right, which is confirmed by clue 18.
* Clue 3 places the roller driver (German) to the right of the writing hobbyist.
* Clues 10 and 21 imply that the police-officer is also a photography enthusiast.
* Clue 12 implies that the tram driver is between the chef and the scooter driver (Dutch).
* Clue 13 places the Thai in the middle, which helps to anchor other positions.
