Lv6-2x4-1	"After analyzing the given clues, I came up with the following solution:


###########

|            |     1      |    2     |    3     |    4    |
| Beverage   | Juice    | Water   | Lemonade | Mirinda |
| Sport      | Volleyball| Baseball | Handball | Cycling |

###########


Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:


From clue (3), we know that baseball is to the right of volleyball. This gives us a possible ordering: Volleyball, ?, ?, ? and Baseball, ?, ?, ?

From clue (1), we know that baseball is to the left of handball. This means that handball cannot be in position 2, so it must be in position 3 or 4.

Now, let's consider clue (5). The person drinking juice is on the right of the person who's sport is baseball. This means that juice cannot be in position 1 or 2. If we place juice in position 4, then baseball would have to be in position 3, but this contradicts clue (1), which says baseball is to the left of handball.

So, juice must be in position 3. But wait! Clue (5) also implies that baseball cannot be in position 3 or 4. This means baseball can only be in position 2.

Now, let's fill in the gaps:


* Volleyball goes to position 1.
* Baseball goes to position 2.
* Juice goes to position 3.
* Handball must go to position 4 (because of clue (1)).


From clue (4), we know that mirinda is on the right of handball. This means mirinda cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3, so it must be in position 4.

But wait! We already placed handball in position 4. So, this means cycling (the only sport left) must go to position 4, and mirinda goes to the person who's sport is not listed yet... which is cycling.


Finally, we can fill in the remaining beverages:


* Water goes to volleyball (because it's the only beverage left for this spot).
* Lemonade cannot be baseball (clue (2)), so it must go to handball.


And that's our final solution!

Lv6-2x4-2	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############

|            |   1   |     2      |    3     |     4     |
| Beverage   | Sprite |  Mirinda |  Iced-Tea |    Milk   |
| Food       | Onion | Lettuce | Grapefruit | Artichoke |

#############


Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning:

* From clue 1, artichoke is on the far right (column 4).
* From clue 6, lettuce must be to the left of artichoke (column 3 or column 2).
* From clue 5, onion is to the left of mirinda. Since mirinda cannot be in column 1 (due to clue 8), it must be in column 2 or column 3.
* Considering clues 2 and 8 together, milk must be in column 4, and mirinda must be in column 2.
* From clue 7, sprite is on the right of iced-tea. Since sprite cannot be in column 1, it must be in column 1 or column 3 doesn't work because then iced-tea would have to be in column 4, which conflicts with milk being in column 4). Therefore, sprite is in column 1.
* From clue 3, onion is to the left of sprite. This means onion is in column 1 (and matches the beverage sprite).
* Iced-tea must be in column 3 (due to clue 7 and because columns 1, 2, and 4 are taken by other beverages).
* Grapefruit is left as the only option for column 3's food.
* Lettuce is left as the only option for column 2's food.

Lv6-2x4-3	"Based on the clues, I'll try to solve the puzzle. Here's my step-by-step reasoning:

From clue 4, we know the doctor drinks fanta.
From clue 6, we know the person drinking fanta is in an odd position, so it must be either position 1 or 3.

Let's assume the doctor (drinking fanta) is in position 1. Then, from clue 5, the person drinking hot-chocolate would be on the left of the doctor, which means there is no one to the left of the doctor. This contradicts our assumption, so the doctor must be in position 3.

Now, we have:

|            |      ?      |       ?        |   Doctor (Fanta)    |   ?    |
| Beverage   |             |                |        |        |
| Job        |             |                |        |        |

From clue 5, the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the doctor. Since the doctor is in position 3, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 2.

We also know from clue 7 that the coach is on the far left or far right. Let's assume the coach is on the far left (position 1). Then, we can start filling in the table:

|            |      Coach   |       ?        |   Doctor (Fanta)    |   ?    |
| Beverage   |             |                |        |        |
| Job        |             |                |        |        |

Now, let's consider clue 3: the electrician is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 2, the electrician can be either in position 1 (which is taken by the coach) or position 4. Let's assume the electrician is in position 4.

We also know from clue 8 that the electrician is somewhere to the left of the police-officer. This means the police-officer must be in position 4, but we already placed the electrician there. So, our assumption was wrong, and the electrician cannot be in position 4. Therefore, the electrician must be in a different position.

Let's re-examine clue 8: the electrician is somewhere to the left of the police-officer. This means the electrician can be in either position 1 or 2, but we already placed the coach in position 1 and the person drinking hot-chocolate in position 2. So, our initial assumption was correct, and the electrician must be in a different column.

Since the electrician cannot be in position 4 (as it would contradict clue 8), the police-officer must be in position 4.

Now, let's look at the remaining beverage: sprite. We know from clue 2 that the doctor is not the person drinking sprite, and from clue 1 that the person drinking water is not the coach. The only one left to drink sprite is the electrician (or the police-officer, but we already placed the police-officer in position 4). Let's assume the electrician drinks sprite.

We can now fill in the table:

|            |      Coach   |       Hot-Chocolate        |   Doctor (Fanta)    |   Police-Officer |
| Beverage   |             |                |        | Water        |
| Job        |             | Electrician    |        |        |

Finally, we know from clue 1 that the person drinking water is not the coach. The only one left to drink water is the police-officer.

Here's the final solution table:

Lv6-2x4-4	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:


From clue 1, we know the hedgehog is on the left of the snake.


From clue 2, the guinea-pig is somewhere to the left of the quad-bike.


From clue 3, the trike owner is not the guinea-pig owner.


From clue 4, the trike is to the right of the quad-bike.


From clue 5 (again!), the snake is to the left of the trike.


Now, let's combine the information:


Since the guinea-pig is to the left of the quad-bike and the hedgehog is to the left of the snake, and the snake is to the left of the trike, we can start building a possible order:


guinea-pig -> ? -> hedgehog -> snake -> ?


We know the quad-bike is to the right of the guinea-pig, so it's likely in the second position:


guinea-pig -> quad-bike -> hedgehog -> snake -> ?


The trike must be to the right of the quad-bike, and since the snake is to its left, the order becomes:


guinea-pig -> quad-bike -> hedgehog -> snake -> trike


Now we can add the last pet: goldfish. It's the only one left!


Since there are four means of transport (quad-bike, subway, train, trike), and the person driving the train is on the right of the person driving the subway (clue 5), we know the order for the second row:


subway -> ? -> train


The train must be to the right of the quad-bike (since the subway-train pair can't fit in the first two positions), so we have:


guinea-pig (quad-bike) -> hedgehog (subway) -> goldfish (?) -> snake (train) -> trike


But wait! We still need a pet for the second row, third column. It must be the goldfish!


Here's the final solution table:

| Beverage    | 7up        | milk | fanta    | i-tea|
| Transport   | car         | bike | boat      | snowmobile|

Let me explain how I arrived at this solution:


From clue (1), we know that the person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking milk. This means that 7up cannot be in column 4.


From clue (2) and (3), we know that the person drinking milk is to the left of both the car and the boat drivers. This implies that milk cannot be in column 1, as there would not be enough space for both the car and boat to be on its right.


From clue (5), we know that the bike rider is not drinking 7up. If we place bike in column 2, this leaves room for the person drinking iced-tea to be on the left of fanta, as per clue (6).


Now, let's look at clue (4): ""the person drinking fanta is not the person driving the snowmobile"". This tells us that fanta cannot be in column 4. Therefore, we place fanta in column 3.


Finally, from clue (7), we know that the car driver is on either far left or far right. Given that milk must be to its left, this means the car must be in column 1.


Putting it all together gives us the final solution:


#############
|             |     1      |  2   |    3     |   4   |

| Movie-Genre   | Mystery | Spy    | Disaster | Thriller   |
| Nationality   | Indian   | Polish | Colombian| Australian |

Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 5, we know that the person watching spy movies is somewhere to the left of the australian (clue 6). Since the australian is on the far right (clue 3), the person watching spy movies must be in column 1 or 2.

Clue 7 states that the person watching spy movies is also to the left of the person watching disaster movies. This means that the person watching spy movies cannot be in column 4, so it must be in column 1 or 2.

Clue 8 states that the person watching mystery movies is to the left of the polish (and also clue 9 repeats this). Since the polish cannot be in column 1 (because the person watching spy movies is already there), the polish must be in column 2. This means that the person watching mystery movies is in column 1.

From clue 4, we know that the colombian is to the right of the polish. Therefore, the colombian must be in column 3 or 4.

Since the australian is on the far right (clue 3), and the colombian is to the right of the polish (clue 4), the colombian must be in column 3, and the australian must be in column 4.

The only movie-genre left for column 1 is mystery, and the only nationality left for column 2 is polish. The person watching spy movies must be in column 2, so the polish watches spy movies.

The colombian cannot watch thriller movies (clue 6), so they must watch disaster movies.

The australian cannot watch disaster movies (because they are to the right of them), and they also cannot watch mystery or spy movies. Therefore, they must watch thriller movies.

Lv6-2x4-7	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 5, we know that the fan gospel is on the far left, so we can start with:

| Music-Genre   | Gospel |         |             |             |

From clue 6, we know that the person watching spy movies is the fan country. Since gospel is on the far left, country must be either in position 2 or 3 (because it's on the right of gospel). But from clue 4, we also know that country is on the left or right of reggae. If country were in position 2, then reggae would have to be in position 1, but we already know that gospel is in position 1. Therefore, country must be in position 3.

From clue 7, we know that the person watching zombie movies is somewhere to the left of the fan country. This means that zombie movies must be in either position 1 or 2.

From clue 6, we know that the person watching spy movies is the fan country. This means that spy movies cannot be in position 1 (because gospel is not country), so zombie movies must be in position 2.

Now we can start filling in the remaining blanks. From clue 1, we know that gospel is on the left or right of country. This means that reggae must be in position 2.

|            |   1   |     2      |       3       |      4       |
| Beverage   | 7up   |    milk    |  soy-milk    |     tea      |
| Job        | coach | journalist | social-worker| photographer |

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 1, we know the coach is to the left of the journalist. From clue 4 and 5, we can deduce that the journalist must be in position 2 or 3.

Clue 6 tells us the coach is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up. Since the coach is already placed to the left of the journalist (clue 1), it's more likely that the coach is paired with the 7up drinker.

From clue 8, we know the social-worker is not drinking milk. Combining this with clue 3 and 4, we can place the social-worker in position 3, as they must be to the right of the journalist and cannot be drinking milk.

Clue 2 tells us the social-worker is somewhere to the left of the photographer. With the social-worker already placed in position 3, this means the photographer must be in position 4.

From clue 7, we know the person drinking tea is to the right of the soy-milk drinker. Since the social-worker is not drinking soy-milk (they're not drinking milk, and they're on the right of the journalist who is on the left or right of the soy-milk drinker), this means the soy-milk drinker must be in position 3, which contradicts our previous placement of the social-worker. However, re-examining clue 5, we can see that it only requires the soy-milk drinker to be on the left or right of the journalist, not necessarily next to them.

Considering all these constraints and clues, I placed the soy-milk drinker in position 3 seems unlikely given other constraints. However, re-examining clue 5 again: ""the person drinking soy-milk is on the left or right of the journalist##3"". This means that soy milk can be on either side of journalist (2). Considering this, we need to rearrange some positions.

Let me correct my solution:


|            |   1   |     2      |       3       |      4       |

Lv6-2x4-9	"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:


From clue 4 and 6, we know that the person driving the subway is in an even position and is the lawyer.

| Transport   |            |        |            |           |

From clue 7, we know that the bartender is not the person driving the subway. Since the bartender is in an odd position (clue 1), the bartender can be in either position 1 or 3.


From clue 5, we know that the person driving the airplane is somewhere to the right of the lawyer. The lawyer is already in an even position (2 or 4). If the lawyer were in position 2, there would not be enough space for the airplane to be to its right. Therefore, the lawyer must be in position 4.


From clue 5 again, we know that the person driving the subway (lawyer) is on the left of the person driving the skateboard. Since the lawyer is in position 4, the skateboard must be in an odd position (1 or 3). If it were in position 3, there would not be enough space for another job and transport combination to its right.


So far:

| Job         |            |        |            | Lawyer   |
| Transport   | Skateboard |        |            | Subway   |

From clue 8, we know that the fisherman is somewhere to the right of the teacher. This means that the fisherman cannot be in position 1 or 2 (as they would not have enough space for a job and transport combination to their right). Therefore, the fisherman must be in either position 3 or 4.


Since we already know the lawyer is in position 4, the fisherman must be in position 3. This also means that the teacher must be somewhere to the left of the fisherman (position 1 or 2).


The only job left for position 1 or 2 is the bartender. Since the bartender cannot drive the subway (clue 7), it must drive either the airplane or the helicopter.


From clue 3, we know that the person driving the airplane is somewhere to the right of the lawyer. However, there are no more positions available to the right of the lawyer (as position 4 is already occupied by the lawyer). This means that the airplane cannot be driven by anyone in this puzzle.


The only job left for the bartender is the helicopter. Therefore:


|             |     1      |   2    |     3      |     4     |
| Job         | Bartender | Teacher| Fisherman | Lawyer   |

From clue 8, we know that the teacher is to the left of the fisherman. This means that the teacher must be in position 2.


The only transport combination left for the teacher and fisherman is the airplane and skateboard (which cannot be driven by the fisherman as it's already occupied). Therefore:

| Transport   | Helicopter| Airplane| Skateboard | Subway   |

Lv6-2x4-10	"Based on the given clues, I will solve the puzzle step by step:


From clue 3 and 7, we know that the person whose sport is weightlifting is in an even position (2 or 4). Since the owner of the rabbit is to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting (clue 4), the person who's sport is weightlifting must be in position 2.


From clue 8, we know that the owner of the hedgehog is the person whose sport is golf. From clue 1, we know that this person cannot own a ferret.


From clue 5, we know that the owner of the hedgehog (whose sport is golf) is not the person who's sport is weightlifting.


The current state of the table:


|         |    1     |       2       |    3    |    4     |
| Pet     |          | Weightlifting |         |          |
| Sport   |          |               |         |          |

From clue 2, we know that the owner of the rabbit is to the left of the owner of the fish. This means the rabbit must be in position 1 or 3.


Since the person who's sport is weightlifting is already in position 2, and the owner of the hedgehog (whose sport is golf) cannot own a ferret (clue 1), we can deduce that the ferret must be in position 4.


Now, let's try to place the remaining pets. The rabbit cannot be in position 3 because it would not be to the left of the fish. Therefore, the rabbit must be in position 1.


The current state of the table:


|         |    1     |       2       |    3    |    4     |
| Pet     | Rabbit   |               |         | Ferret   |
| Sport   |          | Weightlifting |         |          |

From clue 6, we know that the person who's sport is surfing is not the owner of the fish. This means the fish must be in position 3.


The current state of the table:


|         |    1     |       2       |    3    |    4     |
| Pet     | Rabbit   |               | Fish    | Ferret   |
| Sport   |          | Weightlifting |         |          |

From clue 8, we know that the owner of the hedgehog is the person whose sport is golf. This means the hedgehog must be in position 1 is not possible (rabbit is there), so it must be in a different row.


The current state of the table:


|         |    1     |       2       |    3    |    4     |
| Pet     | Rabbit   | Hedgehog     | Fish    | Ferret   |
| Sport   |          | Weightlifting |         |          |

Since there is no other information that would indicate the sport of the person who owns the rabbit, and we already know that surfing is not with fish (clue 6), we can safely place golf in position 4 (since it cannot be with ferret), and then surfing must go to position 1.


The current state of the table:


|         |    1     |       2       |    3    |    4     |
| Pet     | Rabbit   | Hedgehog     | Fish    | Ferret   |
| Sport   | Surfing  | Weightlifting | Golf    |          |

The remaining sport is swimming, which must go to position 3.
