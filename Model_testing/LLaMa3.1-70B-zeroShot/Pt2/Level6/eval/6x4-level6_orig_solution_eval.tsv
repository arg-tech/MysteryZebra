Lv6-6x4-2	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############

|               |      1       |    2     |      3      |       4       |

| Transport     | bus          | train      | scooter     | skateboard    |

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 10, we know that the person eating broccoli is also into swimming. Since broccoli is not on the far left or right (clue 18), it must be in position 4.
* Clue 6 tells us that the owner of the horse is to the left of the person who's sport is surfing. Since surfing is to the right of skateboarding (clue 8), the owner of the horse must be in position 3 or 2. However, clue 11 states that the owner of the horse is to the right of the person drinking juice, so it can't be in position 3.
* Clue 4 indicates that the person drinking water is to the left of the person eating zucchini. Since zucchini is not on the far left (clue 18), it must be in position 2 or 3.
* Clue 9 tells us that the person driving the bus is to the left of the person eating raspberry. Since raspberry can't be on the far right (clue 1), it must be in position 3.
* Putting these clues together, we get a partial solution:

|               |      ?       |    zucchini   | raspberry    | broccoli      |

* Clue 5 tells us that the person drinking almond-milk is in an odd position. Since almond-milk can't be on the far left (clue 14), it must be in position 3.
* However, we already know that raspberry is in position 3, so this means that clue 5 actually refers to position 1 or 2 being eliminated, and position 3 is indeed an odd position. Therefore, almond-milk must be in position 1.
* Clue 15 tells us that the owner of the rat is on the left or right of the owner of the cat. Since cat can't be on the far right (clue 14), it must be in position 2. Rat must then be in position 3, but since we already know that raspberry is in position 3, this means that rat and cat must actually be swapped.
* Clue 17 tells us that the person driving the train is to the left of the person driving the skateboard. Since train can't be on the far right (clue 12), it must be in position 2.
* Putting these clues together, we get a partial solution:

|               |      ?       |    zucchini   | raspberry    | broccoli      |
| Beverage      | almond-milk  | juice         | lemonade     | water         |

* The remaining pieces fall into place with relative ease:
	+ Clue 13 tells us that the mexican is not driving the skateboard, so it must be in position 1 or 3. Since we already know that the person eating potato is on the left or right of the mexican (clue 16), and potato can't be on the far left (clue 18), it means that the mexican must be in position 1.
	+ Clue 2 tells us that the person drinking juice is not thai, so thai must be in position 2 or 4. Since we already know that the nigerian is to the right of the owner of the hedgehog (clue 7), and the owner of the cat is to the left of the nigerian (clue 14), it means that thai must be in position 2, and nigerian must be in position 4.
	+ Clue 19 tells us that the mexican is not eating raspberry, so it must be eating potato."	{'beverage': ['almond-milk', 'juice', 'lemonade', 'water']}	False	0	False

| Transport     | car       | bus       | snowmobile | motorbike    |
#############


Here's how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 13, the person drinking milk is on the far left.


From clue 16, the owner of the horse is also on the far left, so the french (clue 17) must be in position 1, with milk as their beverage and horse as their pet.


Clue 9 states that the owner of the cat is the person who's hobby is writing. Since the person drinking milk (position 1) has a hobby (writing), they cannot have a cat as their pet.


From clue 3, the person driving the car is in an odd position. Clues 4 and 10 further restrict this to being on the far left or far right of the bus driver. Given that the french are already on the far left, the car must be driven by someone other than them.


Clue 18 states that the person who's hobby is collecting is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the person drinking milk (position 1) has a hobby (writing), they cannot have collecting as their hobby.


From clue 2, the Australian is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is hiking. Clue 8 states that the person who's hobby is collecting eats carrot, so position 2 must be the collector, eating carrot and having an odd-numbered hobby (collecting).


Clue 1 states that the person who's hobby is hiking is the person eating kale. Since the Australian cannot be on the far left or right, they must be in position 3.


Position 4 can now be filled with soy-milk as their beverage (clue 6), making them Colombian, with rock-climbing as their hobby and nectarine as their food.


Finally, we fill in the remaining gaps: cat for position 3's pet (Australian), motorbike for the person drinking sprite, bus for the person driving it (position 2 cannot be the bus driver since they drive a car), fish for the rabbit's owner (Russian), and snowmobile for its corresponding position."	{'beverage': ['milk', '', '', 'soy-milk'], 'food': ['strawberry', 'carrot', 'kale', 'nectarine'], 'hobby': ['writing', 'collecting', 'hiking', 'rock-climbing'], 'nationality': ['french', 'russian', 'australian', 'colombian'], 'pet': ['horse', 'fish', 'cat', 'rabbit'], 'transport': ['car', 'bus', 'snowmobile', 'motorbike']}	True	7	False
Lv6-6x4-4	"After solving the logic puzzle, I got the following solution:

| Nationality   | Chinese   | Thai     | Italian  | Australian|
| Transport     | Trike     | Bus      | Motorbike| Car      |

Here's how I solved it:

From clue 1, the Italian is to the left of the Australian. From clue 16, the Australian is on the far left or far right. Since the Italian cannot be on the far left (clue 5), the Australian must be on the far right.

From clue 2, the freelancer drinks coffee. From clue 4, the person driving the motorbike is to the right of the freelancer. From clue 17, the person drinking cola drives the bus. From clue 7, the person driving the car is to the right of the person driving the trike.

From clue 8, the person drinking soy-milk is to the left of the Thai. From clue 12, the person drinking soy-milk is not the Thai. Therefore, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 2, and the Thai must be in position 3.

From clue 10, the person who's hobby is puzzles is to the left of the person driving the bus. Since the freelancer drinks coffee (clue 2) and the motorbike driver is to the right of the freelancer (clue 4), the freelancer cannot drive the bus. Therefore, the person with puzzles as a hobby must be in position 3.

From clue 18, the person who's hobby is cooking is between the fan hip-hop and the freelancer. Since the freelancer drinks coffee (clue 2) and the motorbike driver is to the right of the freelancer (clue 4), the cooking hobbyist cannot be in position 1 or 2. Therefore, the cooking hobbyist must be in position 3.

From clue 21, the fisherman is Chinese. From clue 14, the accountant is to the left of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since the freelancer drinks coffee (clue 2) and the motorbike driver is to the right of the freelancer (clue 4), the fisherman cannot be in position 1 or 2. Therefore, the fisherman must be in position 1.

The rest of the solution falls into place from here.

| Sport         | Water-Polo     | Lacrosse    | Swimming   | Handball   |

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

From clue 3, we know the police-officer is on the far left.

From clue 1, we know the person drinking water is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming. Since swimming can't be in position 1 (because it would contradict with clue 3), it must be in position 4 or 3. We'll come back to this later.

From clue 2, we know the person drinking fanta is the person who's hobby is skydiving. From clue 6, we know this person is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk. So, fanta and skydiving are in positions 3 or 4, and soy-milk is in position 4.

From clue 7, we know the person drinking water is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since water can't be in position 2 (because it would contradict with clue 1), it must be in position 1.

Now, let's go back to swimming. From clue 1, we know the person drinking water is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming. So, swimming must be in position 3.

From clue 9, we know the lawyer is on the left or right of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since lawyer can't be in position 1 (because it would contradict with clue 3), it must be in position 2 or 4. But from clue 15, we know the lawyer is in an odd position, so it must be in position 1 or 3. Combining these two clues, the lawyer must be in position 1 or not exist (because there's already a police-officer in position 1). Since there is a lawyer, it must be in position 3.

From clue 16, we know the fan salsa is not the person watching musical movies.

Now, let's fill in some gaps:

|               |       1        |     2      |     3     |     4     |

| Sport         | Water-Polo     |             | Swimming   | Handball   |

From clue 10, we know the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the person drinking fanta. So, filmmaking must be in position 1 or 2.

From clue 4, we know the person who's hobby is skydiving is not the person watching adventure movies.

Now, let's look at music-genre. From clue 13, we know the fan d&b is between the person who's sport is lacrosse and the person watching musical movies.

From clue 14, we know the person who's hobby is drawing is on the right of the person watching satire movies.

Let's combine these clues:

|               |       1        |     2      |     3     |     4     |

Lv6-6x4-10	"I'll solve the logic puzzle and provide the final solution table.


After analyzing the clues, I've deduced the following:


|               |       1       |     2     |      3      |     4     |

| Transport     | subway        | bus         | bike         | tram        |

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:


From clues 1 and 9, we know the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far left and is also a fan of blues.


Clue 14 tells us that this person is to the left of the photography enthusiast. Since clue 3 states that the photography enthusiast is a fan of trance, and clue 4 says the fan of trance is on the left or right of the country music fan, we can conclude that the order for these three people must be: blues (hot-chocolate), country, and trance (photography).


Clue 2 tells us that the reggae fan is to the right of the fanta drinker. Since clue 6 says the traveling enthusiast is to the left of the fanta drinker, we can conclude that the order for these three people must be: traveling, fanta, and reggae.


Now, let's look at the food preferences:


Clues 5 and 8 tell us that banana and tomato are in odd positions. Since asparagus (clue 11) is in an even position (2 or 4), we can conclude that banana must be in position 1 or 3, and tomato must be in position 1 or 3.


Clue 17 tells us that banana is to the left of the tram driver. This means banana cannot be in position 1 (since hot-chocolate is already there). Therefore, banana must be in position 3.


Tomato, being an odd-positioned food item, must be in position 1.


Asparagus is in an even position (2 or 4), and since asparagus is paired with golf (clue 11) and the bus driver (clue 15), we can conclude that asparagus must be in position 2.


Garlic is paired with bike driving (clue 13). Since water-polo is to the left of garlic (clue 12), and sailing cannot be paired with garlic or water-polo, sailing must be paired with tomato.


Now, let's look at the transport:


Clues 10 and 18 tell us that the person drinking milk is on the left or right of the basketball player, and the person who's sport is water-polo is to the right of the bus driver. Since milk cannot be paired with water-polo (clue 10), we can conclude that milk must be paired with the subway driver.


The person who's hobby is puzzles is also a fan of blues (clue 20). Therefore, this person must be in position 1 and drive the subway.


The bus driver is in an even position (2 or 4) and must be paired with golf. This means the tram driver cannot be paired with asparagus or golf. Since banana is to the left of the tram driver (clue 17), we can conclude that the tram driver must be in position 4.


The person eating garlic drives a bike, which leaves no other option for this person but to be in position 4's adjacent position, i.e., position 3 is not possible since banana is already there. Hence garlic and biking are paired with water-polo (since it cannot be sailing), resulting in:
