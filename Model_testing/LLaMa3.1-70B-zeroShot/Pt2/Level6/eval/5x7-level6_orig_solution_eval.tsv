Lv6-5x7-1	"After solving the logic puzzle, I came up with the following solution:

| Beverage      | lemonade   | iced-tea      | almond-milk | hot-chocolate| milk        | soy-milk | hot-cho te    |
| Hobby         | card-games | collecting     | rock-climbing| fishing      | writing     | sudoku   | cooking       |
| Movie-Genre   | musical    | time-travel    | zombie       | sports       | spy          | action    | scientific     |
| Music-Genre   | gospel     | indie          | trance       | salsa        | blues       | rock      | jazz          |

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 3, we know that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not drinking soy-milk##6. From clue 32, we also know that this person is on the left or right of the owner of the ferret##3.
* Clue 27 tells us that the owner of the guinea-pig is on the far left or far right##3. Given the constraints from other clues, it's more likely that they are on the far left (position 1).
* Using clue 28, we can deduce that the person drinking lemonade must be in position 1, as they need to be to the left of the owner of the mouse.
* From clue 10, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is in an odd position##4. Since there are no other constraints on this beverage, it's likely that it's in position 3 or 5. However, from clue 24, we also know that they need to be to the right of the fan trance. Given the other constraints, it's more likely that hot-chocolate is in position 4.
* From clue 2, we can deduce that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing must be in position 3, as they need to be to the left of the person drinking almond-milk.
* Using clue 25, we can place iced-tea and almond-milk in positions 2 and 5, respectively (or vice versa).
* From clue 15, we know that the person watching spy movies is somewhere to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since this person is also drinking milk##31, they must be in position 5.
* We can now start filling in the hobbies using clues 1-49.

* Clue 26 established a relationship between the software-developer and water drinker.
* Clue 27 tied together eggplant, peach, and orange eaters.
* Clues 28-30 revealed salsa as the far right music genre, avocado eater as nurse, and pakistani's proximity to orange eater.
* Clue 31 resolved security-guard's nationality.
* Clues 32-35 further constrained positions for coach (russian), lemonade drinker, and person eating nectarine.
* Clues 36-39 tied together mechanic, lettuce eater, and eggplant eater with their respective neighbors.

Here's a brief explanation of the solution process:

* First, I used clues 25 and 26 to place the german journalist on position 2, driving the van.
* Clue 29 placed the coach between the german journalist and the pilot.
* Clues 10 and 31 helped me determine that the photographer was in an odd position (either 3 or 5), but not 1, since they were to the right of the airplane driver.
* From clue 6, I knew the airplane driver couldn't be the chinese. This led me to place the pilot on position 6, with the american as their nationality.
* Clue 28 helped me determine that the person watching adventure movies was somewhere to the left of the crime movie fan. Since the adventurer is in an odd position (clue 9), I placed them on either position 1 or 3. But since they're on the right of the turkish (clue 7), it had to be position 3.
* Clues 15, 17, and 20 helped me figure out that the person eating pear was on the right of the time-travel movie fan, who is in an even position. This placed them on position 4.
* With the journalist's placement (clue 19) and their relation to the thriller movies (clue 18), I deduced that the german watched thriller movies.
* Clues 36, 38, 42, and 44 helped me narrow down the chinese person's job. Since they couldn't be the coach or the librarian, and were to the right of the asparagus eater, it placed them on position 5, watching disaster movies.
* The rest of the puzzle fell into place using various other clues.

| Nationality   | canadian   | argentine | malaysian| mexican  | brazilian | egyptian  | dutch     |

Here's how the solution was derived:


* From clue 23, zombie movies are in an even position, and from clue 30, it is to the right of water.
* Clue 28 says disaster movies are on the far right (7).
* Clue 29 puts the egyptian between techno and dutch. Since dutch is at position 7 (clue 25), this places the egyptian at position 6.
* From clue 26, the egyptian eats onion.
* Clue 42 puts onion on the left or right of time-travel movies.
* Clue 31 says watermelon watches time-travel movies.
* Since kale is sports (clue 15) and water drinks kale (clue 39), kale must be at position 6. However, the egyptian is already there, so this forces a swap with another person eating spinach or eggplant to meet clue 25. Thus, kale moves to position 5.
* From clue 4, tea is left of dutch and therefore must be at position 1, 2, or 3.
* Clue 11 puts folk left of disaster movies (at position 7), so folk cannot be at position 6 or 7. 
* From clue 32, the fan r&b is on the left of folk, which places r&b at either position 1 or 2.
* Since eggplant can only be at positions 1 or 7 (clue 6), and tea cannot be at position 7 (because dutch is there), eggplant must be at position 1.
* From clue 33, folk is not argentine. This places folk at either position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
* Clue 34 says spinach is not scientific movies. Since eggplant watches adventure movies (clues 1 and 11), this means the person eating spinach must watch animation movies (the only other option).
* From clue 35, d&b is on the right of eggplant.
* From clue 12, argentine is at an even position, which places it at either position 2 or 4. But from clue 38, spinach eats to the right of argentine, and since spinach watches animation movies (deduced earlier), this means that argentine must be watching time-travel movies.
* From clues 36 and 37, tea is left of onion, which puts it at either position 2 or 3. Since eggplant already occupies position 1, the person drinking tea cannot watch adventure movies. This places them at position 3.
* Clue 14 says argentine is at an even position, so this confirms that they are watching time-travel movies (position 4).
* From clue 17, animation movies must be left of tea (at position 2), and since argentine watches time-travel movies at position 4, the person eating spinach must watch animation movies.
* Clue 22 puts iced-tea to the right of juice, which places it between positions 2 and 6. Since it cannot be at position 5 (because water is drinking kale), this means that it must be either position 3 or 4. But tea watches adventure movies (from clue 1), so this cannot happen since they are already watching animation.
* From clues 20 and 27, the malaysian watches disaster movies (position 7). This confirms that dutch is at position 6, as egyptian must be between techno and dutch.
* Clue 5 places zombie movies right of the person watching adventure movies, which puts them at position 4 or 5. Since argentine is at position 2, this forces a swap to get the correct nationalities in order. Thus, argentine moves to position 4 (where they were previously), and malaysian swaps out with another nationality that can be on either side of time-travel movies: mexican.
* Clue 40 confirms that country watches animation movies at position 1.

#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

From clue 39, we know that baseball is on the far left. Clue 20 tells us that the owner of the lizard is the person who's sport is cricket, and from clue 8, we can infer that the bird is to the left of cricket. Putting these together, we get:

1. Baseball
2. Bird (water-polo)
3. Ferret (ice-hockey)

Clue 31 tells us that the lizard is on the right of the fan indie. Since indie and soul are adjacent (clues 17 and 21), we can place them to the right of baseball.

From clue 10, we know that guinea-pig is between bus and dog. Clue 11 tells us that guinea-pig is to the right of dog, so:

4. Guinea-pig
5. Dog

Clues 26 and 35 tell us that electronic is on the left of soccer and airplane, respectively. Since airplane is already placed (clue 5), we can infer that electronic is between baseball and skiing.

The remaining pieces fall into place using the other clues:

* Clue 12 tells us that train is to the right of indonesian.
* Clue 16 places golf (d&b) to the right of baseball.
* Clue 25 places ice-hockey to the left of australian, which puts it at position 3.
* Clues 28 and 32 place egyptian between dutch and french.

Note that some clues were redundant or provided additional confirmation for already-placed pieces."	{'music-genre': ['', '', '', '', '', '', ''], 'nationality': ['australian', 'russian', 'mexican', 'dutch', 'egyptian', 'indonesian', 'french'], 'pet': ['lizard', 'bird', 'ferret', 'guinea-pig', 'dog', 'goldfish', 'fish'], 'sport': ['baseball', 'water-polo', 'ice-hockey', 'cricket', 'skiing', 'golf', 'soccer'], 'transport': ['airplane', 'train', 'helicopter', 'bus', 'taxi', 'motorbike', 'trike']}	True	5	False
