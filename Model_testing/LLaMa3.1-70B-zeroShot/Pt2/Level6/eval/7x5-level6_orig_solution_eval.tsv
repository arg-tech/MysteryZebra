Note: The numbers in the rules refer to the column number.

Explanation:

From rule 25, the Thai is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies. From rule 22, the person who's hobby is sudoku is the person watching scientific movies. From rule 30, the person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Combining these rules, we can deduce that the Thai and the person watching martial-arts movies are in columns 3 and 4.

From rule 35, the Indonesian is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton. From rule 20, the American is not the person who's sport is badminton. Therefore, the person who's sport is badminton must be the British or the Argentine. But from rule 8, the person who's sport is badminton is the fan gospel, and from rule 26, the person driving the snowmobile is between the fan gospel and the owner of the frog. Since the American is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile (rule 32), the person who's sport is badminton cannot be in column 5. Therefore, it must be in column 1.

From rule 34, the person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the fan soul. From rule 39, the person driving the taxi is somewhere to the left of the person driving the subway. Since the person driving the subway is in an odd position (rule 12), it must be in column 3 or 5. But if it were in column 5, there would not be enough space for the fan soul and the person driving the taxi. Therefore, the person driving the subway must be in column 3.

From rule 19, the person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the British. Since the British cannot be in column 1 (because of the badminton player), it must be in column 2.

From rule 27, the person watching comedy movies is not the person driving the roller. From rule 21, the person watching comedy movies is not the person who's sport is swimming. Therefore, the person watching comedy movies must be in column 4 or 5. But if it were in column 5, there would not be enough space for the fan r&b (rule 16). Therefore, the person watching comedy movies must be in column 2.

From rule 36, the fan r&b is somewhere to the right of the British. Since the British is in column 2, the fan r&b must be in column 3 or 4. But from rule 16, the fan r&b is on the left or right of the person watching scientific movies, which is in column 4. Therefore, the fan r&b must be in column 3.

From rule 15, the owner of the lizard is somewhere to the right of the fan blues. From rule 6, the person who's hobby is writing is on the left of the person watching adventure movies, which is also the owner of the lizard (rule 6). Therefore, the fan blues must be in column 1.

From rule 29, the owner of the ferret is on the far left or far right. Since it cannot be in column 5 (because of the filmmaking hobby), it must be in column 1.

The rest of the puzzle can be solved by using the remaining rules and eliminating possibilities."	{'hobby': ['writing', 'collecting', 'filmmaking', 'sudoku', 'fishing'], 'movie-genre': ['sports', 'comedy', 'scientific', 'martial-arts', 'adventure'], 'music-genre': ['soul', 'gospel', 'blues', 'r&b', 'ambient'], 'nationality': ['british', 'american', 'indonesian', 'thai', 'argentine'], 'pet': ['ferret', 'frog', 'goldfish', 'lizard', 'goat'], 'sport': ['badminton', 'parkour', 'surfing', 'tennis', 'swimming'], 'transport': ['taxi', 'snowmobile', 'subway', 'roller', 'airplane']}	True	14	False

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

1. Clue 21 states that the bartender is drinking lemonade, which must be in position 1 or 5 (Clue 2).
2. From Clue 11, we know the bartender is skydiving.
3. Clue 25 states the mechanic is somewhere to the right of the architect, so they can't be in positions 1-3.
4. The Nigerian person's hobby is puzzles (Clue 6), and they're eating peach (Clue 24).
5. From Clues 13 and 16, we know the Mexican is on either side of the Nigerian, which means they must be in position 2 or 4.
6. Using process of elimination, I filled out the remaining positions.
