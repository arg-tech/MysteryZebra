Lv6-3x2-1	"Let's analyze the given information:

From statement 1, we know that the project-manager does not watch musical movies, so they must watch crime movies.

From statement 2, we know that the person watching musical movies is on the right of the owner of the ferret. This means that the owner of the ferret cannot be watching musical movies, because then there would be no one to their right. Therefore, the owner of the ferret watches crime movies.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |        1        |    2    |
| Job           |                 |         |
| Movie-Genre   |                 |         |
| Pet           |                 |         |

We know that the project-manager watches crime movies. We also know that the owner of the ferret watches crime movies. Since there is only one person who can watch crime movies, we conclude that the project-manager owns a bird and the teacher owns a ferret.

The person watching musical movies must be on the right of the owner of the ferret, which means they are in column 2. Therefore, the teacher watches musical movies.

Here's the completed table:

Lv6-3x2-2	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who's hobby is baking is not the person eating pumpkin.
This means that if we find a row with ""baking"" in the Hobby column, the corresponding Food cannot be pumpkin.

2. The person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the left of the person watching disaster movies.
Since there are only two columns, this means that the person who's hobby is baking must be in column 1, and the person watching disaster movies must be in column 2.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |    1    |     2      |
| Food          |         |            |
| Hobby         |         |            |
| Movie-Genre   |         |            |

We know that the person who's hobby is baking is in column 1. We also know that this person cannot be eating pumpkin (from clue 1). Therefore, the person in column 1 must be eating pepper.

As for the Hobby and Movie-Genre columns, we can now fill them in:

|               |    1    |     2      |
| Food          | Pepper |            |
| Hobby         | Baking | Card-games |
| Movie-Genre   | Musical| Disaster   |

Now we have a complete table. We can add the ""##########"" markers around it:

Lv6-3x2-3	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a possible solution:


|             |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage    | Water         | Cola        |
| Job         | Social-worker | Journalist   |
| Transport   | Van           | Motorbike    |

Here's my reasoning:

From clue 2, we know the social-worker is to the left of the person drinking cola. This means the social-worker must be in column 1.

Clue 1 tells us that the person driving the van is not drinking water. Since the social-worker (column 1) can't be drinking cola (due to clue 2), they must be drinking water.

Now, let's consider the transport options. If the social-worker (drinking water) were driving a motorbike, then the person in column 2 would have to drive a van and drink cola (since it's not water). But this contradicts clue 1! Therefore, the social-worker must be driving a van.

The only remaining option for column 2 is the journalist drinking cola on a motorbike.

Lv6-3x2-4	"Based on the clues, I'll try to fill in the table.


From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is gardening does not own a hamster.

From clue 2, we know that the owner of the hamster is on the right of the scientist.


Let's start by placing the scientist. Since the owner of the hamster is on the right of the scientist, the scientist must be in column 1.


|         |     1     |      2      |
| Hobby   |           |             |
| Job     | Scientist |             |
| Pet     |           |             |

Now, since the person who's hobby is gardening does not own a hamster (clue 1), and the owner of the hamster is on the right of the scientist (clue 2), we can conclude that:


* The person in column 1 has a hobby other than gardening.
* The person in column 1 cannot own a mouse, since the owner of the hamster is on the right.


So, let's place the dressmaker in column 1 and give them the hobby board-games. We'll also assign them a pet mouse.


|         |     1     |      2      |

| Job     | Scientist | Dressmaker  |
| Pet     | Mouse      |             |

Now, we can fill in the remaining slots:


* The person in column 2 must have the hobby gardening (since the other hobby is already taken).
* The person in column 2 must own a hamster (since they are on the right of the scientist).


Here's the completed table:

Lv6-3x2-5	"Let's break down the clues:


1. The person watching horror movies is to the left of the person whose sport is rowing.
This means that if Rowing is in column 2, then Horror must be in column 1.


2. The person eating pomegranate is not the person who's sport is rowing.
This doesn't give us a direct placement yet, but we can use it to eliminate possibilities later.


Based on clue 1, let's place Horror in column 1 and Rowing in column 2:


|               |      1      |     2     |
| Food          |             |           |
| Movie-Genre   | Horror      |           |
| Sport         |             | Rowing    |

Now we need to fill in the remaining blanks.


We know that the person eating pomegranate is not the one whose sport is rowing (clue 2). Since rowing is in column 2, Pomegranate must be in column 1:


|               |      1      |     2     |
| Food          | Pomegranate |           |
| Movie-Genre   | Horror      |           |
| Sport         |             | Rowing    |

Now we have one food and one movie-genre left: Pumpkin and Superhero.


The person whose sport is rowing (column 2) must be the one who eats pumpkin:


|               |      1      |     2     |
| Food          | Pomegranate | Pumpkin   |
| Movie-Genre   | Horror      |           |
| Sport         |             | Rowing    |

Finally, we can place Superhero in column 1, and Basketball (the only sport left) in column 1:


|               |      1      |     2     |
| Food          | Pomegranate | Pumpkin   |

Here's my reasoning:

From clue 1, we know that the Brazilian is on the right of the person driving the ship. This means that the Brazilian cannot be driving the ship, and must be in column 2.

From clue 2, we know that the fan of funk is not driving the trike. Since there are only two options for music-genre (funk and indie), this implies that the fan of indie must be driving the trike.

Putting these together, we can deduce that the person driving the ship is the Nigerian who likes indie music, and the Brazilian who likes funk music is in column 2."	{'music-genre': ['indie', 'funk'], 'nationality': ['nigerian', 'brazilian'], 'transport': ['ship', 'trike']}	True	4	False

From clue 1, we know that the person driving the scooter is not eating broccoli.


From clue 2, we know that the person driving the scooter is to the left of the Australian.


Since there are only two columns, this means that the Australian must be in column 2.


Now, let's try to fill in the table:


|               |    1    |     2      |
| Food          |         |            |

| Transport     |         |            |

From clue 1, we know that the person driving the scooter is not eating broccoli. This means that the person in column 1 must be eating lemon and driving the scooter.


So, the table becomes:


|               |    1    |     2      |
| Food          | Lemon   | Broccoli   |
| Nationality   |         |            |
| Transport     | Scooter |            |

Now, we know that the Australian is in column 2. The only nationality left is Polish, so it must be in column 1.


The table becomes:


|               |    1    |     2      |
| Food          | Lemon   | Broccoli   |
| Nationality   | Polish  | Australian |
| Transport     | Scooter |            |

Finally, the only transport left is the jet-ski, so it must be in column 2.

Lv6-3x2-8	"Based on the given clues, here's my attempt at solving the puzzle:


|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | cola     | iced-tea   |
| Music-Genre   | rock     | electronic |
| Sport         | baseball | lacrosse    |

Let me explain how I arrived at this solution:


From clue #6, we know the person drinking iced-tea is not a fan of rock music. Therefore, the person who drinks iced-tea must be the fan of electronic music.


From clue #5, we know the fan of rock music is to the left of the person whose sport is lacrosse. Since there are only two columns, this means the fan of rock music must be in column 1. If they were in column 2, there would be no one to their right for the lacrosse fan.


Given these constraints, I've filled out the table as shown above.

| Beverage    | Fanta   | Water     |
| Food        | Avocado| Zucchini  |
| Transport   | Roller  | Motorbike |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 1, we know the person eating zucchini is on the right of the person drinking water. This means the person drinking water must be in column 1, and the person eating zucchini must be in column 2.


|             |    1    |     2     |
| Beverage    | Water   | ?         |
| Food        | ?       | Zucchini  |
| Transport   | ?       | ?         |

From clue 2, we know the person eating zucchini is not driving the roller. Therefore, the roller must be in column 1.


|             |    1    |     2     |
| Beverage    | Water   | ?         |
| Food        | ?       | Zucchini  |
| Transport   | Roller  | ?         |

Now we can deduce that the person drinking water is driving the roller (column 1), and the person eating zucchini must be using a motorbike.

| Beverage    | Water   | ?         |
| Food        | ?       | Zucchini  |
| Transport   | Roller  | Motorbike |

Finally, we can conclude that the person drinking fanta is eating avocado (by process of elimination).

Clue 1: The owner of the rabbit is not a fan of R&B.
Clue 2: The person who likes Cricket is to the right of the owner of the Rabbit.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:


From Clue 2, we can deduce that the owner of the Rabbit must be in column 1 (since someone has to be to their right).

Now, let's analyze Clue 1: The owner of the rabbit is not a fan of R&B. This means the person in column 1 cannot like R&B.
