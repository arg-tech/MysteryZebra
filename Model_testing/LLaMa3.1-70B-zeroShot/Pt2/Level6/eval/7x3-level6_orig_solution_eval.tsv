Lv6-7x3-1	"I'll help you solve the logic puzzle.


After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:

| Sport         | water-polo        | climbing   | lacrosse   |
#############


Here's how the solution was derived:


From clue 5, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is on the far left or far right. Since there are only three positions, this means that the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 1.


From clue 10, we know that the person drinking milk is in an even position. This means that the person drinking milk must be in position 2.


From clue 6, we know that the owner of the mouse is the person eating artichoke. Since there are only three food options, this means that the person eating artichoke must be in position 1 (to avoid conflicts with other clues).


From clue 4, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the person eating zucchini. This means that the person eating zucchini cannot be in position 1, so it must be in position 2.


From clue 7, we know that the person eating zucchini is somewhere to the right of the nigerian. Since the person eating zucchini is already in position 2, this means that the nigerian must be in position 3.


From clue 8, we know that the coach is somewhere to the left of the scientist. This means that the coach cannot be in position 3, so it must be in either position 1 or 2. However, since the person drinking iced-tea (who is also the person eating artichoke) is already in position 1, the coach must be in position 2.


From clue 9, we know that the person who's sport is climbing is on the right of the software-developer. Since the scientist is already to the right of the coach, this means that the software-developer must be in position 2 and the person who's sport is climbing must be in position 3.


From clue 11, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda. Since there are only three positions, this means that the person who's hobby is writing must be in either position 1 or 2. However, since the coach and software-developer are already in positions 2 and 3, respectively, the person who's hobby is writing must be in position 1.


From clue 12, we know that the person eating nectarine is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is climbing. This means that the person eating nectarine cannot be in position 1 or 2, so it must be in position 3.


The rest of the puzzle can be filled in using the remaining clues:


* The pakistani is between the australian and the person who's hobby is fishing (clue 2), so the pakistani must be in position 2.
* The owner of the bird is between the person who's hobby is fishing and the person who's sport is water-polo (clue 1), so the owner of the bird must be in position 3.


And that's it!

Lv6-7x3-2	"After solving the puzzle, I got the following solution:

#############


Let me explain the steps I took to solve the puzzle:


From clue 1, we know that the owner of the hamster is driving a skateboard.

From clue 4 and 11, we can deduce that the social-worker is on the left of the person eating cranberry, who has a hobby in board-games. From clue 8, we know that the owner of the hamster (skateboard) is to the left of the person with a hobby in board-games.

From clue 6, we can place the lawyer on the left of the jazz fan.

From clue 10, we know that the person who's sport is snowboarding is in the middle. Since there are three columns, this means that the person must be in column 2.

Using clues 3 and 9, we can deduce that ice-hockey (ship) must be on the right of snowboarding (middle), which puts it in column 3.

From clue 7, we know that the software-developer is to the right of the soul fan. Since there's only one place left for the software-developer, this means that they must be in column 3.

Now, using all the clues, I filled in the rest of the table.

#############

Note: The solution is derived by using the given clues and applying logical deductions step by step. Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 5, we know the person with the hobby ""Board-games"" is on the far left. From clue 14, we also know that the Lawyer is on the far left. Therefore, column 1 is: Board-games (hobby), Lawyer (job).

Clue 6 tells us that the owner of the ferret is to the right of the person with the hobby ""Board-games"". This means the ferret's owner must be in either column 2 or 3.

From clue 8, we know the owner of the rat drives a boat. Clue 7 states that the owner of the mouse is in an odd position (either column 1 or 3). Since the lawyer is already in column 1, and the person driving the quad-bike (Mexican) can't be in column 1 (due to clue 4), column 3 must be: Boat (transport), Rat (pet).

Now, let's look at clue 10. The Thai is in an odd position, which means they can only be in either column 1 or 3. However, since the Malaysian is already a possibility for column 1, and the Mexican has to be in column 2 (due to clue 4), the Thai must be in column 2.

From clue 12, we know the Thai doesn't watch superhero movies. Clue 13 states that the person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike. This means the person driving the quad-bike (Mexican) can only watch superhero or scientific movies. Since the scientific movie fan's position isn't specified, let's assign them to column 1 for now.

Clue 9 tells us that the rock music fan is also a singer. Clue 3 states that the singer is somewhere to the right of the scientist. Therefore, we can deduce that the scientist must be in either column 2 or 3. Given that the lawyer is already in column 1 and the dancer would likely pair well with singing (rock music), it makes sense for the scientist to be in column 2.

Now we have: Column 1 - Lawyer (job), Board-games (hobby); Column 2 - Scientist (job), Thai (nationality); Column 3 - Dancer (job), Boat (transport), Rat (pet).

Clue 11 tells us that the punk fan is somewhere to the right of the soul fan. Given the available positions, it makes sense for the soul fan to be in column 1 and the punk fan in column 2.

We're left with: Column 1 - Soul (music); Column 2 - Punk (music), Ferret (pet).

The only remaining movie genre is fantasy, which we know from clue 13 must be on the right of the person driving the quad-bike. This places it in column 3.

Finally, let's look at the remaining music genres: rock and soul are already assigned. Since the singer has to be somewhere to the right of the scientist (clue 3), we can deduce that the singer is actually in column 2 or 3. Given the available positions, it makes sense for the singing hobby to be paired with the rock music genre.

This completes the solution table."	{'hobby': ['board-games', 'singing', 'photography'], 'job': ['lawyer', 'scientist', 'dancer'], 'movie-genre': ['scientific', 'superhero', 'fantasy'], 'music-genre': ['soul', 'punk', 'rock'], 'nationality': ['malaysian', 'thai', 'mexican'], 'pet': ['mouse', 'ferret', 'rat'], 'transport': ['train', 'quad-bike', 'boat']}	True	16	False
Lv6-7x3-4	"Here is the solved logic puzzle:


|               |    1     |      2       |     3     |
| Beverage      | Iced-tea | Juice        | Soy-milk  |

| Pet           | Pony     | Rabbit       | Rat       |
| Sport         | Skiing   | Swimming     | Baseball  |

 
Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

From clue 12, we know that the person eating apple is on the far left.

Clue 14 tells us that the person drinking juice is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since there are only three positions, and the person eating apple is already on the far left, this means that the person drinking juice must be in position 1 or 2.

Clue 6 says that the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person eating asparagus. This means that the person eating asparagus cannot be in position 1 (because there's no one to their left). Therefore, the person eating apple (who is in position 1) must drink either juice or iced-tea.

Now let's look at clue 10: the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the owner of the rabbit. We know from clue 15 that the owner of the rabbit is the person who's hobby is gardening, so we can infer that the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 1 or 2.

Clue 16 tells us that the italian is the person who's sport is swimming. Since the person eating apple is already on the far left, this means that the italian cannot be in position 1 (because there's no one to their right).

Now let's look at clue 5: the person who's sport is baseball is on the left of the librarian. This tells us that the librarian must be either in position 2 or 3.

From clue 11, we know that the librarian is somewhere to the right of the videographer. Therefore, the videographer must be either in position 1 or 2.

Clue 13 says that the mechanic is somewhere to the left of the person drinking soy-milk. This tells us that the mechanic cannot be in position 3 (because there's no one to their right). Since we already know that the videographer is in either position 1 or 2, this means that the mechanic must be in position 1.

From clue 4, we know that the dutch is on the far left or far right. We've already placed a malaysian in position 1 (because they're eating apple), so this means that the dutch must be in position 3.

Now let's look at clue 7: the person who's sport is skiing is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is baseball. This tells us that the person who's sport is skiing cannot be in position 3 (because there's no one to their right).

From clue 9, we know that the person who's sport is skiing is not the owner of the rabbit. We've already placed a rabbit in position 2 (because they're owned by the gardener), so this means that the person who's sport is skiing must be in position 1.

Now let's look at clue 8: the dutch is not the person eating asparagus. This tells us that the person eating asparagus cannot be in position 3 (because the dutch is already there). Therefore, the person eating lemon must be in either position 2 or 3.

From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. We've already placed a gardener in position 2 (because they own the rabbit), so this means that the filmmaker must be in position 1.

Clue 3 says that the owner of the pony is on the left or right of the owner of the rat. Since we already know that the owner of the rabbit is in position 2, this means that the pony and rat must be in either positions 1 and 3 (in some order).

Now let's look at clue 2: the owner of the rat is on the right of the owner of the pony. This tells us that the pony must be in position 1.

We've now placed all the values except for one beverage, which can only be iced-tea because it's the only option left.

Here is the final solution:

Lv6-7x3-5	"After analyzing the clues, I have arrived at a possible solution:

| Transport     | snowmobile    | skateboard   | tram        |
#############


Here's how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 4, the photographer is on the far right, so column 3 has ""photographer"" as the job.
* From clue 9, the photographer is the fan of reggae music, so column 3 also has ""reggae"" as the music-genre.
* From clue 7, the brazilian is the person who's sport is volleyball, so column 3 also has ""brazilian"" as the nationality and ""volleyball"" as the sport.
* From clue 12, the german is the person drinking iced-tea, so column 2 has ""german"" as the nationality and ""iced-tea"" as the beverage.
* From clue 11, the american is the person eating asparagus, so column 1 has ""american"" as the nationality and ""asparagus"" as the food.
* From clue 13, the person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the left of the person drinking fanta. Since fanta can't be in column 1 (because asparagus is already there), it must be in column 3. Therefore, baseball is in column 1, and volleyball is in column 3.
* From clue 2, the person who's sport is volleyball is on the left or right of the fan reggae. Since volleyball is in column 3 and reggae is also in column 3, this clue doesn't give us any new information.
* From clue 1, the person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the left of the person drinking iced-tea. This confirms that baseball is in column 1 and iced-tea is in column 2.
* From clue 5, the person driving the skateboard is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since iced-tea is in column 2, hot-chocolate must be in column 1, and skateboard must be in column 2.
* From clue 6, the fan electronic is not the person driving the skateboard. Since skateboard is in column 2, electronic must be in either column 1 or 3. However, since rock is already in column 2 (because reggae is in column 3), electronic must be in column 1.
* From clue 10, the person eating kale is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since asparagus is already in column 1, kale must be in column 2, and snowmobile must be in column 3. However, this contradicts our previous conclusion that skateboard is in column 2. Therefore, we swap kale and mango, so that kale is in column 1 and mango is in column 2.
* From clue 8, the police-officer is not the fan rock. Since rock is already in column 2, police-officer must be in either column 1 or 3. However, since entrepreneur is also a possibility for column 1 (because we haven't yet determined the job for column 1), and photographer is already in column 3, we place police-officer in column 1.
* Finally, from clue 3, the entrepreneur is not the fan reggae. Since reggae is already in column 3, entrepreneur must be in either column 1 or 2. However, since police-officer is already in column 1, entrepreneur must be in column 2.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 1, the person driving the boat is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games.

From clue 3, the person watching comedy movies is the person who's sport is parkour. Since the person eating carrot is on the far right (clue 5), and the person watching comedy movies is also the software-developer (clue 8), we can conclude that the person in position 3 has a hobby of singing, watches comedy movies, eats carrot, and does parkour.

From clue 2, the person driving the van is between the person watching western movies and the person watching comedy movies. Since the person watching comedy movies is in position 3, the person driving the van must be in position 2.

From clue 10, the dutch is between the chinese and the person driving the bus. This means that the person in position 1 has a nationality of chinese.

From clue 9, the person who's sport is basketball is in an odd position. Since the person eating carrot is on the far right (clue 5), we can conclude that the person in position 1 has a sport of basketball.

From clue 12, the mechanic is on the right of the person who's sport is basketball. This means that the person in position 2 has a job of freelancer, and the person in position 1 has a job of mechanic.

| Transport     | motorbike     | trike      | boat       |
#############


Let me explain my reasoning:

From clue 4, the person drinking tea is on the left of the person eating cucumber. This means that tea must be in position 1 or 2.

Clue 3 states that the person drinking hot-chocolate is the person who's hobby is chess. Since hot-chocolate can't be in position 1 (because tea is), it must be in position 2.

From clue 9, the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving. This means that skydiving must be in position 3.

Clue 11 states that the person who's hobby is skydiving is somewhere to the left of the fan reggae. Since reggae can't be in position 1 (because tea and hot-chocolate are already there), it must be in position 2 or 3. But since salsa is on the right of cucumber (clue 1), salsa must be in position 3, which means reggae must be in position 2.

From clue 6, the japanese is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving. This means that japanese must be in position 1 or 2. But since polish is already in position 2 (because it's on the left of the person driving the boat, clue 10), japanese must be in position 1.

The rest of the puzzle can be solved using a combination of clues:

* Cucumber must be in an odd position (clue 3 and 4), so it goes in position 2.
* Grapefruit is in an even position (clue 8), so it goes in position 3.
* The person driving the motorbike is somewhere to the right of the person watching thriller movies (clue 7), so thriller must be in position 1 or 2. But since musical is already in position 1, thriller must be in position 2.
* Comedy is on the left of boat (clue 2), so it goes in position 3.
* Trike is not driving musical movies (clue 5), so trike goes in position 2.

| Transport     | trike        | scooter        | snowmobile   |


The reasoning is as follows:

From clue 6, the person who's sport is badminton is on the far left. From clue 10, the person driving the trike is on the left of the fan salsa, so they must be in position 1.

From clue 14, the fan salsa is the person who's hobby is sudoku, so they must be in position 3.

From clue 8, the person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the fan salsa, so they must be in position 2 or 3. Since salsa is already in position 3, rowing must be in position 2.

From clue 1, the owner of the bird is the fan salsa, so the bird must be in position 3.

From clue 9, the owner of the cat is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since iced-tea is already in position 1, the cat must be in either position 2 or 3. But since the bird is already in position 3, the cat must be in position 2.

From clue 5, the chef is somewhere to the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the paramedic (clue 7) and gardening hobbyist (clue 2) are both on either side of the snowmobile driver, the chef must be in position 1.

From clue 4, the person driving the snowmobile is not the person drinking almond-milk. Since almond-milk is already in position 2 or 3 (due to clue 3), and snowmobile is in position 3 (since it's on the right of gardening hobbyist, which is in position 2), almond-milk must be in position 2.

From clue 11, the person who's hobby is cooking is not the fan blues. Since cooking is already in position 1, blues must be either in position 2 or 3. But since salsa (which is in position 3) has a different hobby (sudoku), blues must be in position 1.

From clue 13, the fan blues is somewhere to the left of the fan metal. Since blues is already in position 1, metal must be either in position 2 or 3. But since salsa is already in position 3 and has a different hobby (sudoku), metal must be in position 2.

From clue 12, the person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since sudoku is in position 3, almond-milk must be either in position 1 or 2. But since it can't be in position 1 (due to clue 4), it must be in position 2.

The remaining positions are filled accordingly.

| Transport     | Ship     | Taxi      | Trike        |

Note: The solution is based on the given clues, and it's the only possible arrangement that satisfies all the conditions.


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 2, we know the American is in the middle. Clue 7 tells us that the person who's sport is parkour is on the left of the American. Since there are only three positions, this means the person with parkour as their sport must be in position 1.


Clue 10 states that the person driving the ship is watching disaster movies, and clue 12 says the fan of punk music is driving the ship. So, we can fill in the ship/trike/taxi column: Ship (Punk) in position 1.


From clue 4, we know the owner of the fish is between the owner of the mouse and the owner of the frog. Since there are only three positions, this means the owner of the mouse must be in position 1, and the owner of the frog must be in position 3.


Clue 13 tells us that the owner of the frog is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is singing. This means the person with singing as their hobby must be in position 1.


Now we can fill in some more rows:


|               |    1     |     2     |      3       |
| Hobby         | Singing  | ?        | ?           |
| Movie-Genre   | Disaster | ?        | ?           |
| Music-Genre   | Punk     | ?        | ?           |
| Nationality   | French   | American | Dutch       |
| Pet           | Mouse    | Fish     | Frog        |
| Sport         | Parkour  | ?        | Snowboarding|
| Transport     | Ship     | Taxi      | Trike       |

From clue 3, we know the person driving the trike is also the one who's sport is snowboarding. Clue 5 tells us that the person with cooking as their hobby is not Dutch.


We can continue filling in rows:


|               |    1     |     2     |      3       |
| Hobby         | Singing  | Gardening | Cooking     |
| Movie-Genre   | Disaster | ?        | ?           |
| Music-Genre   | Punk     | Salsa    | Metal       |
| Nationality   | French   | American | Dutch       |
| Pet           | Mouse    | Fish     | Frog        |
| Sport         | Parkour  | Golf      | Snowboarding|
| Transport     | Ship     | Taxi      | Trike       |

Clue 14 states that the person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the fan salsa. This fits with our current arrangement.


From clue 9, we know the person driving the ship is on the left of the person watching crime movies. Since we already have the person driving the ship in position 1, this means the person watching crime movies must be in position 2.


We can fill in some more rows:


|               |    1     |     2     |      3       |
| Hobby         | Singing  | Gardening | Cooking     |
| Movie-Genre   | Disaster | Crime     | Scientific  |
| Music-Genre   | Punk     | Salsa    | Metal       |
| Nationality   | French   | American | Dutch       |
| Pet           | Mouse    | Fish     | Frog        |
| Sport         | Parkour  | Golf      | Snowboarding|
| Transport     | Ship     | Taxi      | Trike       |

Finally, clue 6 states that the person driving the taxi is not the owner of the mouse. Since we already have the person with the mouse as their pet in position 1, this means the person driving the taxi must be in either position 2 or 3.


From clue 11, we know the French person is not driving the taxi. This means the Dutch person must be driving the taxi.


We've now filled in all the rows:
