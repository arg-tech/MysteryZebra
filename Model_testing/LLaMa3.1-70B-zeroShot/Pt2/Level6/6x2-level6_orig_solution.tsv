Lv6-6x2-1	"I'll solve the puzzle and fill in the table.


After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |       1       |     2     |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate | 7up        |
| Job           | fisherman     | journalist |
| Movie-Genre   | documentary   | comedy     |
| Music-Genre   | metal         | pop        |
| Pet           | ferret        | horse      |
| Sport         | sailing       | basketball |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:


From clue 1, we know that the person watching documentaries is on the left of the person whose sport is sailing.


From clue 2, we can conclude that the person drinking 7up is not the person who plays basketball (so it must be the other way around).


From clue 3, we know that the owner of the horse is either to the left or right of the person who plays basketball. Since there are only two people, this means the horse owner can't be on the left side (because then they would have to be next to the basketball player). Therefore, the horse owner must be on the right.


From clue 4, we know that the fisherman is on the right of the pop music fan. Since the pop music fan is already determined to be on the right (from clue 3), this means the fisherman must also be on the right.


Now we can start filling in the table:


* The person watching documentaries (left) has a job, which can only be fisherman or journalist. But since the fisherman is on the right, it must be the journalist.
* The person who plays sailing (right) must drink hot-chocolate (since 7up is already assigned to the other person).
* The person who drinks 7up (left) has a job, which can only be journalist or fisherman. But since the journalist is already on the left, it must be the fisherman.
* The person who plays basketball (right) must have a music genre that is not pop (since pop is already assigned to the other person). So they get metal.

The rest of the table fills in easily from here.

Lv6-6x2-2	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate | lemonade   |

| Nationality   | turkish       | argentine  |
| Pet           | hedgehog      | guinea-pig |
| Sport         | cricket       | soccer     |
| Transport     | trike         | skateboard |

The explanation is as follows:

From clue 4, we know the fan of dubstep is to the right of the Turkish person. From clue 2, we know the person drinking hot-chocolate is next to the fan of dubstep. Therefore, the Turkish person must be on the left.

Clue 5 tells us that the person who likes cricket is to the left of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the hedgehog can't be with the soccer player (clue 3), the owner of the hedgehog must be on the right, and the cricket player must be on the left.

Now we have:


|               |       Turkish      |     ???     |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate    |            |

| Sport         | cricket          |            |
| Transport     | trike            | skateboard |

From clue 3, we know the soccer player is not the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the guinea-pig can't be with the cricket player (because they are on opposite sides), it must be with the soccer player.

Now we have:


|               |       Turkish      |     Argentine |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate    | lemonade   |
| Music-Genre   | house             | dubstep    |

| Sport         | cricket          | soccer     |
| Transport     | trike            | skateboard |

Finally, we know that the person driving the skateboard is next to the fan of house (clue 1). Therefore, the Argentine person must be on the right.

Lv6-6x2-4	"Based on the given clues, here's the step-by-step reasoning:

From clue 2, we know the person watching superhero movies is to the left of the person driving the helicopter.

From clue 3, we know the fan of house music is to the right of the Argentine.

From clue 4, we know the Malaysian is to the right of the owner of the goat.

Let's start by placing the Argentine in column 1. Since the fan of house music is to the right of the Argentine (clue 3), the person who likes house music must be in column 2.

Now, let's place the person watching superhero movies in column 1, as they are to the left of the person driving the helicopter (clue 2). The person driving the helicopter can only be in column 2.

We also know that the Malaysian is to the right of the owner of the goat (clue 4). Since the Argentine is already in column 1, the Malaysian must be in column 2. This means the owner of the goat is in column 1.

From clue 1, we know the person eating artichoke is not watching documentary movies. Therefore, the person eating apricot must be watching documentary movies.

Now, let's summarize what we have so far:

|               |     1     |      2      |
| Food          | apricot   |             |
| Movie-Genre   | documentary| superhero  |
| Music-Genre   |            | house      |
| Nationality   | argentine | malaysian  |
| Pet           | goat      |             |
| Transport     |            | helicopter |

The only remaining options for column 1 are rock music and bike. The person eating artichoke must be listening to rock music, as they are not watching documentary movies (clue 1). Therefore, the person eating apricot in column 1 is listening to house music, which contradicts our earlier placement of house music in column 2.

Let's correct this by swapping the music genres. The person eating artichoke must be listening to rock music in column 2, and the person eating apricot must be listening to house music, but since the fan of house music is already in column 2 (Argentine), we need to swap the nationalities as well.

Here's the corrected table:

|               |     1     |      2      |
| Food          | artichoke | apricot    |
| Movie-Genre   | superhero | documentary|
| Music-Genre   | house     | rock       |
| Nationality   | malaysian | argentine  |
| Pet           | mouse     | goat       |
| Transport     | bike      | helicopter |

 Wait, we still have a problem. The person eating artichoke is supposed to be listening to rock music, not house music.

Let's try again. This time, let's place the person watching superhero movies in column 1 and the person driving the helicopter in column 2. We'll also place the Argentine in column 1 and the fan of house music in column 2.

|               |     1     |      2      |
| Food          |           |             |
| Movie-Genre   | superhero | documentary|
| Music-Genre   |            | house      |

| Pet           |           |             |
| Transport     |            | helicopter |

Now, let's place the person eating artichoke in column 1 and the person eating apricot in column 2.

From clue 4, we know the Malaysian is to the right of the owner of the goat. Since the Argentine is already in column 1, the Malaysian must be in column 2, but this contradicts our placement of the fan of house music.

Let's try again. This time, let's place the person watching superhero movies in column 1 and the person driving the helicopter in column 2. We'll also place the Argentine in column 2 and the fan of house music in column 2.

|               |     1     |      2      |
| Food          |           |             |
| Movie-Genre   | superhero | documentary|
| Music-Genre   |            | house      |
| Nationality   | malaysian | argentine  |
| Pet           |           |             |
| Transport     |            | helicopter |

Now, let's place the person eating artichoke in column 1 and the person eating apricot in column 2.

From clue 4, we know the Malaysian is to the right of the owner of the goat. Since the Argentine is already in column 2, the Malaysian must be in a different row. Let's place the Malaysian in column 1 and the Argentine in column 2.

We also know that the person eating artichoke is not watching documentary movies (clue 1). Therefore, the person eating apricot must be watching documentary movies.

The only remaining options for column 1 are rock music and bike. The person eating artichoke must be listening to rock music, as they are not watching documentary movies (clue 1).

Now, let's summarize what we have so far:

|               |     1     |      2      |
| Food          | artichoke | apricot    |

| Nationality   | malaysian | argentine  |
| Pet           | goat      | mouse       |
| Transport     | bike      | helicopter |

Here is the final solution:

| Nationality   | italian       | egyptian    |
| Sport         | handball      | skiing      |

Let me walk you through my thought process:


From clue 4, we know the Italian is to the left of the firefighter. This means the Italian must be in column 1.


From clue 5, we know the person who's hobby is puzzles is to the left of the fan of funk music. Since there are only two music genres and hobbies, this means the puzzle enthusiast must be in column 1 as well, with funk music in column 2.


Now, from clue 3, we know the person eating orange is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skiing. This means orange must be in column 1 (since skiing can't be in both columns).


From clue 6, we know the person eating lettuce is not the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since lettuce must be eaten by someone, this means lettuce must be in column 2.


Clue 2 tells us that handball is on the far left or far right. Given our current table, handball can only fit in column 1 (since skiing is already taken in column 2).


Finally, we're left with techno music and skydiving as a hobby for column 1, which fits neatly into place.


So here's the final solution:


|               |      1       |      2      |
| Food          | orange        | lettuce     |

| Sport         | baseball   | water-polo |
| Transport     | car        | bike       |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 2, we know the person driving the car is to the left of the person who's sport is water-polo. This means the car must be in position 1.

From clue 3, we know the musician is in an odd position, so they must be in position 2 (since there are only two positions).

From clue 5, we know the musician is on the left or right of the person drinking water. Since the musician is already placed in position 2, the person drinking water must be in position 1.

Clue 4 tells us that the person who's sport is water-polo is not a fan of punk music. This means the person who likes punk music (ambient is already paired with someone) must be in position 2, which is the musician.

From clue 1, we know the owner of the chinchilla is to the left of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since the car is already placed in position 1, the owner of the chinchilla must also be in position 1.

Now we can fill in the remaining gaps:

The person drinking sprite (not water) must be in position 1, and their job is freelancer. The person who likes baseball must also be in position 1.

Finally, we have:


|               |     1      |     2      |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 4, we know the person who sings is next to the owner of the rabbit. Since the singer can't be on both sides, let's assume they are on the right side.
* Clue 2 tells us that water-polo is on either side of lime. Given that water-polo is not next to the singer (clue 4), it must be on the right side, and lime must be in column 2.
* Clue 3 indicates gospel music is next to the singer. Since gospel can't be on both sides, let's place it in column 1.
* From clue 5, we know water-polo is not using a roller. This implies that biathlon (the only other sport) must use a car, and water-polo must use... no transport? Just kidding! Given the constraints, biathlon must be on the left side, leaving water-polo to use the remaining transport option (roller). However, this contradicts clue 5. Let's swap transports: biathlon uses roller, and water-polo uses car.
* The only remaining pet is lizard, which goes in column 2.

1. From clue #2, we know that the person driving the trike is on the left of the person driving the scooter.
2. Clue #3 tells us that the person whose sport is handball is also the person whose hobby is puzzles. Since the person driving the trike is on the left, they must be the one with handball and puzzles as their preferences.
3. Clue #4 states that the person whose hobby is puzzles (i.e., the one on the left) is to the left of the manager. Therefore, the manager must be on the right.
4. Clue #5 informs us that the chef is the person watching crime movies. Since we already have the person with handball and puzzles on the left, they can't be the chef (as there's no movie-genre associated with them yet). The only possibility is for the chef to be on the right as well.
5. Clue #1 tells us that the fan of indie music is not driving the scooter. Since we have a person on the left and right, and one of them must drive a trike, the other must drive a scooter. Given this, it's safe to say that the person with puzzles, handball, and trike is likely to be associated with indie music.
6. By elimination, the remaining preferences (drawing, western movies, disco music, soccer) can only fit on the right side.

Here's how I derived the solution:

From clue 1, we know the architect is on the far right, so job 2 is ""architect"".

From clue 4, we know the fan of jazz is on the right of the owner of the turtle. This means music-genre 2 is ""jazz"", and pet 1 must be ""turtle"" (since it's to the left).

Now, from clue 3, we know the person driving the boat is somewhere to the left of the person watching romance movies. Since transport 1 is ""boat"" (to the left), movie-genre 2 must be ""romance"".

From clue 2, we know the person whose hobby is sudoku is not the person watching documentary movies. This means hobby 1 is ""sudoku"", and movie-genre 1 must be ""documentary"" (since it's paired with sudoku).

The remaining options can be filled in: job 1 is ""teacher"", music-genre 1 is ""d&b"", pet 2 is ""chinchilla"", transport 2 is ""scooter"", and hobby 2 is ""chess"".

* From statement 5, we know the person drinking tea is on the right of the jazz fan. Since there are only two music genres, this means the person on the left (column 1) must prefer trance.
* Statement 3 tells us that the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left or right of the French person. However, since column 1 already has a job and beverage assigned, we can conclude that the French person must be in column 2.
* Now, looking at statement 6, it says ""the chef is not the french"". This implies that the Dutch person (column 1) is the chef. Therefore, column 2 is French.
