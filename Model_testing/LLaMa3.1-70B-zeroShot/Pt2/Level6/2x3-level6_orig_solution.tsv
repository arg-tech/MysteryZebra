Lv6-2x3-2	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table.

From clue 1, we know that Fantasy is to the left of Family.

From clue 2, we know that Corn is not paired with Thriller.

From clue 3, we know that Thriller is to the right of Mango.

Using these clues, let's try to construct a solution:

|               |    1    |   2    |    3     |
| Food          | Mango  | Lime  | Corn    |
| Movie-Genre   | Fantasy| Family| Thriller|

This solution satisfies all the conditions:

* Fantasy is to the left of Family (clue 1)
* Corn is not paired with Thriller (clue 2)
* Thriller is to the right of Mango (clue 3)

Here is the final solution table:


#############
|               |    1    |   2    |    3     |
| Food          | Mango  | Lime  | Corn    |

Lv6-2x3-3	"Let's analyze the clues:


From clue 3 and 4, we know that the fan soul is either on the far left (1) or far right (3). Since they are to the right of the person watching epic movies, the epic movie watcher cannot be on the far right.


From clue 2, we know that the mystery movie watcher is between the epic and soul music fans. If the soul fan were on the far left, this would not be possible.


So, the soul fan must be on the far right (3). The epic movie watcher cannot be on the far right, so they must be on either 1 or 2.


If the epic movie watcher were on 2, the mystery movie watcher would have to be on 1, but this would mean that the blues fan is watching epic movies, which contradicts clue 1. Therefore, the epic movie watcher is on 1, and the mystery movie watcher is on 2.


The only remaining spot for the disaster movie watcher is 3, but this spot is taken by the soul fan. So, the disaster movie watcher must be on 2 or 1 (the other two genres are already assigned). But if they were on 1, they would be watching epic movies. Therefore, the disaster movie watcher is not on 1.


Since the blues fan is not watching epic movies (clue 1), and the mystery movie watcher is between the epic and soul fans (clue 2), the blues fan must be watching disaster movies.


The final solution table is:


#############
|               |    1    |    2    |    3     |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic   | Mystery | Disaster|

Lv6-2x3-4	"Based on the clues, I'll try to solve the puzzle.


From clue 1, we know that the fan of reggae is not Polish.


From clue 2, we know that the fan of dubstep is somewhere to the right of the fan of reggae. This means that the order is: Reggae -> Dubstep.


From clue 3, we know that the Argentine is somewhere to the right of the fan of dubstep. Since dubstep is already placed after reggae, this means the order for nationality is: _ -> _ -> Argentine


Combining these clues, I'll try to fill in the table:


|               |    1    |    2    |     3     |
| Music-Genre   | Reggae  | Dubstep |           |
| Nationality   |         |         | Argentine |

The only music genre left is rock. It must go in column 3.


As for the nationality, since reggae's fan is not Polish (clue 1), and argentine is already placed in column 3, we can deduce that polish must be in column 2, and mexican must be in column 1.


Here's the final solution:


#############
|               |    1    |    2    |     3     |
| Music-Genre   | Reggae  | Dubstep | Rock      |

Lv6-2x3-5	"Let's analyze the clues:


From clue 1, we know that 7up is to the left of iced-tea.

From clue 2, we know that 7up is between iced-tea and asparagus.


Combining these two clues, we can deduce that iced-tea must be at position 3, and asparagus must be at position 1.


Now, let's look at the remaining options for 7up:


Since 7up is to the left of iced-tea (position 3), it can only be at position 2 or 1. However, since asparagus is already at position 1, and 7up must be between iced-tea and asparagus, 7up must be at position 2.


From clue 3, we know that the person drinking 7up (position 2) does not eat banana.


The only remaining food option for position 2 is raspberry. However, from clue 4, we know that almond-milk is not paired with raspberry. This means that the person at position 2 must drink something other than almond-milk, and since they already drink 7up, this information doesn't provide any new constraints.


We are left with:


|            |      1      |     2     |    3     |
| Beverage   |             |           |          |
| Food       | asparagus  | raspberry | banana   |

 

Since the person at position 1 drinks something other than 7up (position 2), and iced-tea is already at position 3, we can deduce that almond-milk must be at position 1.


Similarly, since the person at position 3 drinks iced-tea, and banana is already assigned to this food column, the beverage for position 3 must indeed be iced-tea.


The final solution table is:


#############
|            |      1      |     2     |    3     |
| Beverage   | almond-milk |     7up   | iced-tea |

Lv6-2x3-6	"Let's break down the clues:

From clue 1, we know that the person who likes traveling is to the left of the punk fan.

From clue 3, we know that the person who likes traveling does not like disco.

From clue 4, we know that the video-games hobbyist is between the indie and disco fans.

Let's start by placing the punk fan in column 2, since they are mentioned in clue 1. We'll also place the traveling hobbyist to their left, in column 1.

|               |     1     |      2      |      3      |

| Music-Genre   |           | Punk        |             |

Now, let's focus on clue 4. Since the video-games hobbyist is between the indie and disco fans, we can place them in column 2 or 3. But wait, column 2 is already occupied by the punk fan! So, the video-games hobbyist must be in column 3.

|               |     1     |      2      |      3      |

| Music-Genre   |           | Punk        |             |

Now, let's go back to clue 4. We know that the video-games hobbyist is between the indie and disco fans. Since they are in column 3, the indie fan must be in column 2 or 1. But column 2 is already occupied by the punk fan! So, the indie fan must be in column 1.

| Music-Genre   | Indie     | Punk        |             |

Finally, let's look at clue 4 again. We know that the video-games hobbyist is between the indie and disco fans. Since they are in column 3, the disco fan must be in column 2 or 1. But columns 1 and 2 are already occupied! So, the disco fan must be in column 3.

Lv6-2x3-7	"Let's start by analyzing the clues:

1. The Nigerian is not the person eating eggplant.
2. The person eating cauliflower is somewhere to the right of the Nigerian.
3. The person eating strawberry is somewhere to the right of the French.

From clue 2, we know that the Nigerian cannot be in column 3 (since there's no one to their right). Similarly, from clue 3, we know that the French cannot be in column 3 (since there's no one to their right).

Let's start by placing the Nigerian. Since they can't be eating eggplant, and cauliflower is to their right, they must be eating strawberry.

|               |    1     |     2      |      3      |
| Food          | Strawberry|            |             |
| Nationality   | Nigerian  |            |             |

Now, since the person eating cauliflower is to the right of the Nigerian, and the French cannot be in column 3 (from clue 3), the French must be in column 2.

|               |    1     |     2      |      3      |
| Food          | Strawberry|            |             |
| Nationality   | Nigerian  | French    |             |

Since the person eating strawberry is to the right of the French (from clue 3), this is not possible. However, we already have the Nigerian eating strawberry in column 1, so this clue must be referring to a different arrangement.

The only other possibility is that the French is in column 1, and the person eating strawberry is in column 2 or 3.

|               |    1     |     2      |      3      |

| Nationality   | French    |            |             |

Since the Nigerian cannot be eating eggplant (from clue 1), and cauliflower is to their right, they must be eating eggplant. But wait, this contradicts our initial assumption!

Let's re-examine our previous steps. We concluded that the French cannot be in column 3. What if we place the French in column 1, and the Nigerian in column 2? This satisfies clue 2.

|               |    1     |     2      |      3      |

| Nationality   | French    | Nigerian  |             |

Now, since the person eating cauliflower is to the right of the Nigerian (from clue 2), and the Thai hasn't been mentioned yet, we can place them in column 3.

|               |    1     |     2      |      3      |
| Food          |            |            | Cauliflower|
| Nationality   | French    | Nigerian  | Thai       |

Since the person eating strawberry is to the right of the French (from clue 3), we can place them in column 2. However, this is already occupied by the Nigerian! What if we swap the food for the Nigerian and the French?

|               |    1     |     2      |      3      |
| Food          | Strawberry|            | Cauliflower|
| Nationality   | French    | Nigerian  | Thai       |

This leaves us with only one option for the Nigerian's food: eggplant.

|               |    1     |     2      |      3      |
| Food          | Strawberry| Eggplant  | Cauliflower|
| Nationality   | French    | Nigerian  | Thai       |

But wait, this contradicts our initial assumption that the Nigerian is not eating eggplant!

Let's go back to our previous conclusion: we can place the French in column 1, and the Nigerian in column 2.

|               |    1     |     2      |      3      |
| Food          |            |            |             |
| Nationality   | French    | Nigerian  |             |

Since the person eating strawberry is to the right of the French (from clue 3), we can place them in column 2 or 3. However, this would mean that the Nigerian is not eating eggplant, which satisfies clue 1.

Let's try placing the strawberry in column 2. This leaves us with only one option for the food in column 1: cauliflower.

Lv6-2x3-9	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who's hobby is collecting is on the left or right of the person watching scientific movies.
2. The person who's hobby is singing is not the person watching adventure movies.
3. The person who's hobby is collecting is the person watching romance movies.
4. The person who's hobby is collecting is on the far right.

From clue 4, we know that Collecting and Romance are on the far right:

| Hobby         |           |            | Collecting |
| Movie-Genre   |           |            | Romance    |

Now, let's use clue 3: The person who's hobby is collecting is the person watching romance movies. This confirms our previous conclusion.

From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is collecting (on the far right) is on the left or right of the person watching scientific movies. Since Collecting is already on the far right, the person watching Scientific must be to their left:

| Hobby         |           |            | Collecting |
| Movie-Genre   | ?         | Scientific | Romance    |

Now, let's use clue 2: The person who's hobby is singing is not the person watching adventure movies. This means that Singing cannot be on the far left (since it would be next to Scientific). Therefore, Chess must be on the far left:

| Hobby         | Chess     |            | Collecting |
| Movie-Genre   | ?         | Scientific | Romance    |

The only remaining hobby is Singing, which must be in the middle. The only remaining movie-genre is Adventure, which cannot be watched by Singing (according to clue 2). Therefore, Adventure must be watched by Chess:

|# Hobby         | Chess     | Singing   | Collecting #|
|# Movie-Genre   | Adventure | Scientific| Romance    #|

From clue 1, we know that soy-milk is to the left of lemonade.

From clue 2, we know that snowboarding is to the left of soy-milk.

From clue 3, we know that cycling is to the left of lemonade.

Combining these clues, we can deduce the order:

Snowboarding - Soy-milk - Cycling - Lemonade

However, this contradicts clue 3. Therefore, the correct order must be:

Snowboarding - Cycling - Soy-milk - Lemonade (no, this also contradicts)
or
Snowboarding - Soy-milk - Lemonade - Cycling

Considering clue 4, we know that coffee is not cycling.

Since soy-milk and lemonade are already assigned to columns 2 and 3, respectively, the only possible assignment for coffee is column 1. However, this would mean snowboarding is also in column 1, which contradicts clue 2. Therefore, snowboarding must be in column 1.

The corrected order is:

 Snowboarding - Soy-milk - Lemonade 

Considering all other clues:
- Coffee cannot be with cycling (clue 4), so coffee must be with snowboarding.
- Cycling can only be with soy-milk or lemonade. Since lemonade's position is fixed, cycling must be with soy-milk.
