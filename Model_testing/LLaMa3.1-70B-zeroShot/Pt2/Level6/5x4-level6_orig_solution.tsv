Lv6-5x4-2	"Here's my attempt at solving the puzzle:


|               |    1     |      2      |    3     |      4      |
| Food          | Goldfish  | Papaya     | Pomegranate| Eggplant   |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy    | Sports     | Family    | Epic       |
| Music-Genre   | Electronic| Reggae     | Pop        | Folk       |
| Pet           | Goldfish  | Ferret     | Lizard     | Goat       |
| Transport     | Train     | Jet-ski    | Boat       | Bus        |

 
Let me explain my reasoning:

From clue 3, the goldfish owner is on the far left or right. Let's place them on the far left (column 1).

Clue 2 states that the goat owner is to the right of the goldfish owner, and since the goat owner is in an even position (clue 7), they must be in column 4.

From clue 9, the eggplant eater is to the left of the goat owner, so they must be in column 3 or 2. Since the eggplant eater is in an odd position (clue 11), they must be in column 3.

Now let's look at the movie genres. From clue 1, the pop fan is to the left of the sports movies watcher. Clue 10 states that the comedy movies watcher is the pop fan, so the pop fan must be in column 2 or 1. Since the comedy movies watcher is not watching sports (clue 4), they must be in column 1.

From clue 5, the goldfish owner is not driving the jet-ski, and from clue 16, the jet-ski driver is to the right of the ferret owner. Let's place the ferret owner in column 2.

The pomegranate eater is between the papaya eater and the boat driver (clue 6). Since the eggplant eater is already in column 3, the pomegranate eater must be in column 2 or 1. But from clue 17, the pomegranate eater is to the left of the lizard owner, so they can't be in column 1. Therefore, the papaya eater is in column 1, and the pomegranate eater is in column 2.

The sports movies watcher must be in column 2 or 3, but since the comedy movies watcher (pop fan) is already in column 1, the sports movies watcher must be in column 3. The family movies watcher is to the right of the sports movies watcher (clue 8), so they must be in column 4.

The epic movies watcher is to the right of the family movies watcher (clue 12), but there's no room for them in column 5, so this means that the family movies watcher and the epic movies watcher are actually in columns 3 and 4 respectively.

Finally, let's fill in the music genres. From clue 14, the reggae fan is between the folk fan and the pop fan. Since the pop fan is already in column 1, the reggae fan must be in column 2 or 3. But from clue 13, the reggae fan is driving the bus, so they can't be in column 1. Therefore, the folk fan is in column 4, and the reggae fan is in column 2.

And that's it! Here's the final solution table:


|               |    1     |      2      |    3     |      4      |
| Food          | Papaya   | Pomegranate | Eggplant | Cauliflower|
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy    | Sports     | Family    | Epic       |
| Music-Genre   | Electronic| Reggae     | Pop        | Folk       |
| Pet           | Goldfish  | Ferret     | Lizard     | Goat       |
| Transport     | Train     | Jet-ski    | Boat       | Bus        |

 Wait no that is incorrect!

Let me redo it.

| Music-Genre   | Pop        | Reggae     | Folk       | Electronic|
| Pet           | Goldfish  | Ferret     | Lizard     | Goat       |
| Transport     | Train     | Jet-ski    | Boat       | Bus        |

Lv6-5x4-3	"After analyzing the given clues, I've come up with a possible solution for the logic puzzle:


|               |    1    |       2       |     3     |    4     |

| Transport     | subway    |         bike   | car       | jet-ski   |

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning:


From clue 1, we know cola is to the right of pumpkin. From clue 14, hot-chocolate is to the right of papaya.
From clue 2, the person driving the subway is to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the subway can't be in position 4 (as it would contradict clue 4), we place it in position 1.
Clue 11 states that the owner of the goldfish is on the far right, so we place goldfish in position 4.
From clue 16, the fan electronic is to the left of the cat. Since electronic can't be in an odd position (clue 5), we place it in position 4. This also satisfies clue 10, which states that the car driver is a fan of electronic music.
Clue 13 tells us that the owner of the goldfish is to the right of the mouse, so we place mouse in position 1 or 2. Since hedgehog must be in an even position (clue 3), and cat can't be on the far left or far right (clue 15), we place mouse in position 1.
From clue 7, reggae is to the left of zucchini. Clue 17 states that zucchini is to the right of raspberry. This gives us the order: reggae-raspberry-zucchini.
From clue 9, gospel can't be with zucchini, so we place gospel in position 1 or 2. Since country can't be with mouse (clue 12), we place gospel in position 1 and country in position 2.

The final solution is:

| Sport         | Cricket |  Lacrosse  |       Sailing        | Skiing  |

 

Explanation:


From statement 11, we know that the fan of R&B is on the far left.
From statement 9, we know that the software-developer is a fan of electronic music.
From statement 5 and statement 10, we can deduce that the person eating orange cannot be in column 4 (because they are to the right of lacrosse), and they also cannot be in column 1 (because R&B fan eats neither apricot nor orange). So, the person eating orange is in column 2 or column 3. We'll come back to this later.
From statement 14, we know that the owner of the hedgehog must be on the left side of the table. And from statement 12, electronic music fan is next to hedgehog. Therefore, we can place software-developer and hedgehog in column 2 or column 3.
From statement 13, we know that the owner of the goat is to the left of the dog owner. Since the rabbit's position isn't fixed yet (statement 2), we'll keep this clue for now.
From statement 7, we can conclude that doctor and software-developer are in adjacent columns. Hence, they must be placed on either side of electronic music fan (column 2 or column 3).
Combining clues from statements 10, 14 and 15, the relative positions of orange-eater, lacrosse-sportsperson, hedgehog owner, radish-eater and cricket-player can be determined. The order should be: Orange < Lacrosse < Hedgehog (next to electronic) < Radish < Cricket.
From statement 17, writer is left of sailing person. We have two positions for sailing person - columns 2 or column 4 (because the sport must be to the right of cricket-player).
Now let's combine our findings so far:


|               |    1    |      2      |         3          |   4    |
| Food          | Orange  |             |                    |        |
| Job           | Writer  | Software-Developer  | Doctor          |        |
| Music-Genre   | R&B     |  Gospel/Electronic | Electronic/Gospel | D&B     |
| Pet           | Rabbit  | Goat/Dog      | Hedgehog            | Dog/Goat|
| Sport         | Cricket |  Lacrosse/Sailing  |       Sailing/Lacrosse        | Skiing/Lacrosse|


At this point, there are a few possible placements. We will apply the remaining clues:


From statement 8, we know that D&B is sailing. Thus, column 4 has to be skiing (statement 6).
Using clue from statement 2, if the fan of D&B were on the right side of rabbit owner, then column 3 would have had a pet other than hedgehog and dog/goat - thus failing statement 12.
With the new placements:


|               |    1    |      2      |         3          |   4    |
| Food          | Orange  |             |                    |        |
| Job           | Writer  | Software-Developer  | Doctor          |Firefighter|
| Music-Genre   | R&B     |  Gospel/Electronic | Electronic/Gospel | D&B     |
| Pet           | Rabbit  | Goat       | Hedgehog            | Dog     |
| Sport         | Cricket |  Lacrosse  |       Sailing        | Skiing  |

By using statement 4, we can confirm the position of radish-eater. Similarly, by applying statement 14 and then looking at clue from statement 10 again - apricot is on column 2.
So our solution will look like:


|               |    1    |      2      |         3          |   4    |
| Food          | Orange  | Apricot    |        Radish       | Plum   |
| Job           | Writer  |  Doctor    | Software-Developer  |Firefighter|
| Music-Genre   | R&B     |  Gospel    |      Electronic     | D&B     |
| Pet           | Rabbit  | Goat       | Hedgehog            | Dog     |
| Sport         | Cricket |  Lacrosse  |       Sailing        | Skiing  |

Our logic table is now complete.

Lv6-5x4-7	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


|               |    1     |      2      |       3       |    4     |

| Transport     | Airplane | Motorbike   | Boat          | Car      |

Please note that this solution satisfies all the given conditions.

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:

1. From clues 6 and 2, we know the Egyptian is eating radish, but not at position 1.
2. Clue 10 tells us the Malaysian is to the left of the Egyptian, so Malaysian must be at position 1 or 2.
3. Clue 5 places the person with hobby Woodworking to the right of the Chinese, and clue 9 places Rowing to the right of Woodworking.
4. Clues 7 and 14 place Airplane to the left of Rowing and Car to the right of Rowing.
5. From clue 11, Parkour is next to Lime, so Lime must be at position 2 or 3.
6. Clue 12 places Baking to the left of Rowing, so Baking must be at position 1.
7. With Baking at position 1 and Malaysian also at position 1 (from step 2), we can conclude that Grapes is at position 1.
8. Clue 4 places Motorbike to the right of Baking, so Motorbike is at position 2 or 3.
9. Since Chinese cannot be eating Radish (clue 6), and Italian is not next to Airplane (from clue 3), we can place Chinese and Italian at positions 2 and 3.
10. Clue 15 eliminates Dancing from being next to Surfing, so Dancing must be with Parkour or Rowing.
11. From the remaining options, we can fill in the rest of the table.

I hope this explanation helps!
