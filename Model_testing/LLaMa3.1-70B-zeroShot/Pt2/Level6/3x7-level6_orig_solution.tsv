#############


Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve it:


1. From clue 10, we know that the person watching fantasy movies is in an even position.
2. Clue 14 tells us that the person watching fantasy movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching crime movies.
3. Combining these two clues, we can deduce that the person watching fantasy movies must be at either position 4 or 6 (even positions).
4. However, clue 5 states that the owner of the hedgehog is not American, and since the American is already taken by the Drama movie at position 6, Fantasy must be at position 4.
5. Now we have the person watching fantasy movies at position 4, which means the Argentine (clue 6) must be to their left, i.e., at position 3.
6. Clue 11 states that the person watching drama movies is between British and Chinese. Since Drama can't be at position 1 (left of Fantasy), it must be at either position 5 or 7 (between British and Chinese).
7. From clue 20, we know that Drama is to the left of Family, which narrows it down to position 6.
8. Japanese (clue 24) is in an even position, so they can only be at positions 2, 4, or 6. Since Fantasy already occupies position 4 and Drama is at 6, Japanese must be at position 2.
9. We now have Disaster movies on the leftmost side (position 1), with Pakistani nationality, as there's no restriction for them being to the right of anyone.
10. With Pakistani out of the way, the owner of Fish can only be to their left, making it impossible for them to coexist in the same column. This places Fish at position 2 with Japanese nationality (clue 16).
11. Clues 12 and 21 together restrict Dog from being on either side of Fantasy movies, placing them between Disaster and Action (positions 1-3). The only available spot left is position 2, occupied by the owner of Dog.
12. As per clue 19, Guinea-pig can be to the left of the person watching action movies, which places them at position 3 with British nationality.
13. Since Japanese are already placed at position 2, the only available even position for Action is position 2 itself (which has the owner of Dog). Therefore, the person watching Action must be American (position 6).
14. Clue 8 states that Cat's owner is to the right of Fantasy movies, so French nationality goes with Cat.
15. The remaining positions can now be filled using the leftover clues:
    - Hedgehog goes on the right of Guinea-pig (clue 2), placing them at position 5 with Chinese nationality.
    - Clues 3 and 9 ensure that Thriller is placed to the right of Disaster, Crime, and Family. It fills in position 5 with Chinese nationality.
    - Mouse, being left as the only pet remaining, gets paired up with the last available nationality (Argentine) at position 7.


This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions."

| Sport   | Snowboarding| Climbing     | Surfing  | Biathlon| Skiing  | Cricket | Volleyball|

#############


Here's a brief explanation of the solution:


* Clues 3, 6, and 26 helped establish the order: Snowboarding, Climbing (with Peach), and then the owner of the lizard (Skiing).
* Clue 9 fixed the position of Cricket (and Tomato) at column 5.
* Clue 4 placed Skiing to the left of Cricket, which further solidified the positions.
* The owner of the fish was placed using clues 10, 27, and 29, ensuring it's on the right of Snowboarding and near Chinchilla.
* The remaining pets were distributed based on various clues (e.g., 1, 2, 7, 11, 16, and 25).
* The sport of Biathlon was placed in an odd position using clue 31.
* Clues 12, 18, and 20 helped eliminate some food options for certain columns.
* Finally, the remaining foods were assigned based on the available choices.

#############

Here's the explanation of how I solved it:

From clue 1, the person watching mystery movies is on the far left. From clue 21, this person also likes golf.

From clue 26, the project-manager is between the person watching disaster movies and the person watching mystery movies. So, the project-manager must be in position 2.

From clue 4, the person who's sport is biathlon is the person watching musical movies. From clue 14, this person is also an entrepreneur.

From clue 6, the person who's sport is surfing is not the pilot. From clue 18, this person is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is basketball. So, surfing must be in position 4 or 5 (since it can't be on the far right). 

From clue 7 and 8, the analyst is in an odd position and is not the person watching musical movies. From clue 23, the analyst is somewhere to the left of the person watching musical movies.

From clue 13, the pilot is not the person who's sport is basketball. From clue 16, the pilot is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is biathlon. 

From clue 5, the person watching zombie movies is on the right of the person who's sport is biathlon. So, musical must be in position 6.

Now we have:

| Sport         | golf             | water-polo      | biathlon? | surfing ?    | basketball | snowboarding | badminton  |

From clue 20, the person watching musical movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is surfing. Since it can't be on the far right (due to zombie), surfing must be in position 4.

From clue 22, the software-developer is somewhere to the left of the person watching disaster movies. So, the software-developer must be in position 1 or 3.

From clue 9 and 12, the person who's sport is badminton is on the far right or far left and is to the right of snowboarding. 

Now we have:

|               |         1          |        2        |    3     |      4       |     5      |      6       |     7     |

| Sport         | golf             | water-polo      | biathlon? | surfing     | basketball | snowboarding | badminton  |

From clue 11, the person who's sport is golf is not the person watching thriller movies. 

Now we have:

From clue 15, the person watching scientific movies is somewhere to the left of the dancer.

From clue 24, the entrepreneur is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since it can't be on the far left (due to mystery), water-polo must be in position 2.

Now we have:

|               |         1          |        2        |    3     |      4       |     5      |      6       |     7     |

From clue 25, the person who's sport is water-polo is not the manager. 

Now we have:

|               |         1          |        2        |    3     |      4       |     5      |      6       |     7     |

Now we can fill in the remaining jobs and movie-genres:

From clue 17, the person who's sport is not listed must be the manager.

| Movie-Genre   | musical | time-travel | scientific | action   | superhero | zombie | crime     |
| Music-Genre   | indie   | funk        | trance     | salsa    | punk      | classical| jazz      |

Here's a brief explanation of the steps to arrive at this solution:

1. From clue 14, musical movies are on the far left.
2. From clues 11 and 24, time-travel movies and tea are in position 2.
3. From clues 9 and 13, scientific and zombie movies are in positions 3 and 7 (in some order).
4. From clues 15 and 17, superhero and crime movies are in odd positions (not 2, 4, or 6). Superhero is to the left of sprite (clue 20), so it's in position 5.
5. From clue 10, trance is on either side of tea, which means it's in position 3.
6. From clues 8 and 16, salsa is to the left of crime movies and funk is to the left of salsa. Since salsa can't be in position 1 (indie is there), salsa must be in position 4 or 5. But if it were in position 5, then punk would have to be in an even position (clue 18), which contradicts clue 23.
7. So salsa is in position 4. Funk is on either side of salsa, and since indie is already in position 1, funk must be in position 2 or 3.
8. From clues 12 and 22, trance is to the left of soy-milk, which means it's in position 3. Coffee is to the right of zombie movies (clue 13), so coffee is in position 6.
9. From clue 5, punk is to the right of indie. Since salsa is already in position 4, and superhero is a person watching movies (not music; clue 23), punk must be the person watching superhero movies.
10. From clues 1 and 25, water is somewhere to the left of salsa, which means it's in position 1. Sprite is not action (clue 19) and is on the right side, so it's classical.

Putting all these pieces together yields the final solution.
