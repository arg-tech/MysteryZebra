Lv6-2x2-1	"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who's sport is soccer is on the far left, so we can fill in the ""Sport"" column for the first person:
 
|         |   1    |     2      |
| Food    |        |            |
| Sport   | Soccer |            |

2. The person who's sport is volleyball is not the person eating pear. This means that the person eating pear must be on the left, and their sport is soccer (which we already determined). So, we can fill in the ""Food"" column for the first person:
 
|         |   1    |     2      |
| Food    | Pear   |            |
| Sport   | Soccer |            |

Now, let's look at what's left. The second person's sport must be volleyball (since there are only two sports), and their food must be nectarine (since pear is already taken). So, we can fill in the remaining columns:
 
#############
|         |   1    |     2      |
| Food    | Pear   | Nectarine  |
| Sport   | Soccer | Volleyball |

Lv6-2x2-2	"Let's analyze the puzzle:


From statement 1, we know that the owner of the goat is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig.


From statement 2, we know that the owner of the goat is not eating lemon.


Now, let's fill in the table:


|        |   1   |     2      |
| Food   |       |            |
| Pet    |       |            |

Since the owner of the goat is on the left, the goat must be in column 1. The only food option left for column 1 is apple.


If the owner of the goat was eating lemon, it would contradict statement 2, so we know the owner of the guinea-pig (in column 2) is eating lemon.


The final table is:


#############
|        |   1   |     2      |
| Food   | Apple | Lemon      |
| Pet    | Goat  | Guinea-pig|

Lv6-2x2-3	"Let's break down the information:

From statement 1, we know that the person eating pumpkin is on the left of the person eating plum.

|         |    1     |    2    |
| Food    | Pumpkin | Plum    |

Now, let's look at statement 2: ""the person who's sport is handball is not the person eating plum"". This means that the person eating plum must be sailing.

Since there are only two sports, the person eating pumpkin must be playing handball.

Here is the final solution:

#############
|         |    1     |    2    |
| Food    | Pumpkin | Plum    |
| Sport   | Handball| Sailing|

Lv6-2x2-4	"Let's break down the clues:


From clue 1, we know that the person eating grapefruit does not own a goldfish.


From clue 2, we know that the person eating grapefruit is to the right of the person eating apricot. Since there are only two columns, this means that the person eating apricot must be in column 1, and the person eating grapefruit must be in column 2.


Now, let's look at the pet options. If the person eating grapefruit (in column 2) does not own a goldfish, they must own a hamster. The owner of the goldfish must then be in column 1, eating apricot.


Here is the final solution table:


|        |    1     |     2      |
| Food   | Apricot  | Grapefruit|
| Pet    | Goldfish | Hamster    |

Lv6-2x2-5	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person watching superhero movies is not the person who's sport is lacrosse.
This means that the person who likes superhero movies has a different sport, which must be golf.

2. The person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse.
This means that the person who likes lacrosse is in column 1, and the person who likes superhero movies (and therefore golf) is in column 2.

So, we can fill in the table as follows:

#############
|               |    1     |     2     |
| Movie-Genre   | Musical  | Superhero |
| Sport         | Lacrosse | Golf      |

This solution satisfies both clues. Let me know if you have any further questions!"
Lv6-2x2-6	"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The fan of d&b is on the far right, so column 2 is the d&b fan.
2. The fan of indie is not Japanese.

We can start by filling in the music-genre information:

|               |   1    |    2     |
| Music-Genre   | Indie | d&b       |
| Nationality   |        |          |

Now, let's consider the nationality clue. Since the fan of indie is not Japanese, we can deduce that the Japanese person must be a fan of d&b (column 2).

|               |   1    |    2     |
| Music-Genre   | Indie | d&b       |
| Nationality   | Polish | Japanese |

So, the final solution is:

#############
|               |   1    |    2     |
| Music-Genre   | Indie | d&b       |
| Nationality   | Polish | Japanese |

Lv6-2x2-7	"Since there are only two columns (positions), an odd position would be column 1.


Based on clue 1, the accountant must be in column 1.

Clue 2 states that the accountant is not the owner of the hamster. Since the accountant is already in column 1, this means the hamster must be in column 2 (because if it were also in column 1, then the accountant would own the hamster).


So far we have:


|       |     1      |       2       |
| Job   | Accountant |               |
| Pet   |            | Hamster      |

Now, since there are only two pets and two jobs left to fill in, we can deduce that the goat must be in column 1 (because the accountant is already in column 1) and the social worker must be in column 2.


Here's the completed table:


#############
|       |     1      |       2       |
| Job   | Accountant | Social Worker |
| Pet   | Goat       | Hamster      |

Lv6-2x2-8	"Based on the given clues:


Since there are only two columns, and the person eating kale must be to the left of the person eating potato (Clue 1), we can deduce that the person eating kale is in column 1.


The Japanese person cannot be eating potato (Clue 2). Since they must be either eating kale or potato, and kale's position has been determined, if they were eating kale, it would contradict Clue 2 by not providing an alternative for the Mexican nationality to pair with potato. Therefore, the Japanese person must eat kale in column 1.


Given this setup, the remaining combination (Mexican eating potato) automatically fits into column 2 without violating any clues.


The solution table is:


#############
|               |    1     |    2    |
| Food          | Kale     | Potato |
| Nationality   | Japanese | Mexican|

Lv6-2x2-9	"Based on the clues, I'll solve the puzzle:


Since the person driving the trike is somewhere to the right of the person driving the train (clue 2), we can conclude that:

|               |    1    |   2    |
| Music-Genre   |         |        |
| Transport     | Train   | Trike  |

Now, let's look at clue 1: ""the person driving the train is not the fan techno"". This means the person driving the train must be a fan of dubstep.


So, we can fill in the table:

|               |    1    |   2    |
| Music-Genre   | Dubstep |        |
| Transport     | Train   | Trike  |

Finally, since there are only two music genres and the person driving the trike cannot be a fan of dubstep (because that would mean both people have the same preference), we can conclude that:


|               |    1    |   2    |
| Music-Genre   | Dubstep | Techno |
| Transport     | Train   | Trike  |

The final solution table is:


#############
|               |    1    |   2    |
| Music-Genre   | Dubstep | Techno |
| Transport     | Train   | Trike  |

Lv6-2x2-10	"Let's break down the clues:


Clue 1: The person driving the helicopter is not the firefighter.
This means that either:
- The firefighter drives the van (and someone else drives the helicopter)
- Or, there are two people driving helicopters, but neither of them is the firefighter.


However, we know that there are only two jobs and two modes of transportation. So, it must be the case that the firefighter drives the van, and the other person drives the helicopter.


Clue 2: The entrepreneur is in an even position.
This means that the entrepreneur must be in column 2 (since 2 is an even number).


Putting it all together:


|             |      1      |      2       |
| Job         |             |              |
| Transport   |             |              |

 firefighter (column 1) drives a van, and entrepreneur (column 2) drives the helicopter.

Here's the final solution table:
