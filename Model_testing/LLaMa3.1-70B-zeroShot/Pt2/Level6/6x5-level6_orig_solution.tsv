####################


Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

1. Started by using clues 5 and 6 to determine that the person watching western movies is in an odd position (3 or 5) and the Argentine is also in an odd position.
2. Used clue 11 to place the fan of rock music, which is driving a boat, to the left of the person eating lemon.
3. Clue 16 revealed that the person eating lemon is on the right of the person watching satire movies, allowing me to start building the movie-genre column.
4. From clue 14, I knew the Malaysian is driving the jet-ski and is a fan of indie music. This helped me place the jet-ski in position 5.
5. Using clues 13 and 23, I determined that the person driving the jet-ski (Malaysian) is on the left of the Indonesian.
6. Clue 20 placed the person who's hobby is camping to the right of the Argentine, which helped me determine the order of the nationality column.
7. With clue 26, I was able to place the person who's hobby is dancing to the right of the person watching drama movies.
8. The remaining clues were used to fill in the gaps and ensure consistency throughout the table.

Please note that this solution assumes the puzzle has a unique solution and follows the standard logic puzzle conventions."

| Sport         | rowing       | tennis        | rugby         | soccer        | surfing      |


Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:


* From clue 18, the person who's sport is rowing is on the far left.
* From clue 21, the person who's sport is rowing is the italian.
* From clue 22, the architect is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rowing.
* Since there are only two positions available (1 and 2), I placed the architect in position 1.

Continuing from here:


* From clue 31, the mexican is the person drinking tea. This means they can't be in position 1 or 5 (due to clues 22 and 25).
* From clue 26, the fan folk is somewhere to the right of the mexican.
* From clue 25, the fan indie is between the fan folk and the person watching time-travel movies. This means the fan indie can't be in position 1 or 5.

With these constraints:


* I placed the mexican (drinking tea) in position 2, followed by the russian (drinking soy-milk).
* From clue 27, the person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere to the left of the teacher. This means they can't be in position 4 or 5.
* The egyptian (surfing) must drink hot-chocolate (from clue 10). I placed them in position 4.

The rest of the puzzle falls into place:


* From clue 19, the person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the left of the person drinking 7up. This means they can't be in positions 3 or 5.
* The fan jazz is the photographer (from clue 9). They must drink fanta or 7up (due to clue 7).
* From clue 20, the person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking fanta. This means they can't be in positions 4 or 5.

This leads to:


* The nigerian drinks fanta and the cher drinks 7up.
* From clues 6, 12, and 29, I placed the scientist in position 3 (with soccer) and the doctor in position 2 (satire).
* Finally, from clue 30, the russian must be in a middle position."

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* Clues 10 and 26 helped me place the ice-hockey enthusiast on the far left and the person who's sport is weightlifting in an even position.
* Clue 6 placed the ship driver with tea, which was already deduced to be on the far left (clue 1).
* Clue 25 placed the Italian in the middle, and clue 9 eliminated sprite as their beverage. Clue 12 then identified the manager as the sprite drinker.
* Clues 13 and 27 helped me eliminate the chinchilla owner from being the manager and bartender.
* Clue 19 placed the Indian to the right of the photographer, which was already deduced to be on the far left (clue 10).
* Clue 22 eliminated cycling as a sport for the bartender. Clues 23 and 24 helped me place the trike driver on the far right.
* Clue 1 placed the rat owner to the right of the mouse owner, and clue 30 eliminated the egyptian from being between them.
* The remaining clues were used to fill in the gaps and ensure that all conditions were met.
