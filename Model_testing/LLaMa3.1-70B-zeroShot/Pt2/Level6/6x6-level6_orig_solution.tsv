Note: The solution is based on the given clues, and it's a unique solution. However, please note that this puzzle has some ambiguity in the clues (e.g., ""somewhere to the right"" can be interpreted as immediate or not), but I've tried to provide the most reasonable solution.

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:

* First, I used the direct assignment clues (e.g., #10, #26) to fill in some values.
* Then, I focused on the transport column, using clues like #4, #5, and #24 to determine the order.
* Next, I worked on the movie-genre column, using clues like #6, #8, and #18 to establish relationships between columns.
* After that, I tackled the hobby column, using clues like #1, #2, and #21 to figure out the order.
* The job column was relatively easy to fill in once I had the hobby column mostly solved.
* Finally, I used the remaining clues to fill in any gaps and ensure consistency throughout the table.
