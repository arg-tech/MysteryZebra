| Sport         | cricket  | cycling  | swimming | weightlifting|
#############


Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

From clue 1, we know the person who swims eats broccoli. From clue 7, we know the fan of blues is to the right of the swimmer. Clue 2 tells us that the person who draws is to the left of the weightlifter.

Clue 6 places the person who draws between the fan of blues and the person eating artichoke. Since the fan of blues is already placed to the right of the swimmer, the person who draws must be in position 2.

From clue 5, we know the person who lifts weights is in an even position, which means they're in either position 2 or 4. But since the person who draws is in position 2 (from clue 6), the weightlifter must be in position 4.

Clue 3 tells us that the person who reads is to the right of the person who draws, so they must be in position 3.

From clue 10, we know the person who travels and plays cricket. Clue 9 places this person to the left of the fan of hip-hop. Since the person who travels is in an odd position (from clue 4), they must be in either position 1 or 3. But since position 3 is already taken by the reader, the traveler must be in position 1.

The rest of the clues help us fill in the remaining gaps.

Lv6-4x4-3	"After analyzing the clues, I've filled out the table with the correct information:

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* Clue 2 helped establish that drawing is between fantasy and pop.
* Clues 3, 5, and 7 revealed that spy movies are associated with mirinda, which is in position 3.
* Clues 4 and 6 eliminated milk as a possibility for drawing, so drawing must be sprite (Clue 12).
* Clue 9 confirmed that disaster movies are associated with sprite, which must be in an odd position (Clue 11), specifically position 4.
* Clue 13 revealed that fantasy is electronic, and Clue 2 helped establish its position as 2.
* The remaining clues helped fill out the table:
	+ Time-travel is leftmost (position 1).
	+ Camping is to the right of baking (Clue 10), so camping is in position 1, and baking is in position 3.
	+ Blues is associated with position 1.
	+ Jazz is the only remaining music genre, which fills out position 3.

Lv6-4x4-4	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |     1      |     2      |    3    |      4      |

| Transport     | car         | skateboard | bike    | ship        |

Here's how I deduced the solution:


From clue 8, we know that the Turkish is in an odd position. This means they can be either in column 1 or column 3.


From clue 9, we know that the Chinese is on the far right, so they are in column 4.


From clue 7, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person drinking fanta. Since there's only one position to the left of fanta (column 2), the person drinking soy-milk must be in column 2.


Now, from clue 6, we know that the person driving the ship is somewhere to the right of the person drinking fanta. This means that the person driving the ship cannot be in column 2 or column 3, so they must be in column 4.


From clue 5, we know that the person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the person driving the ship. Since the person driving the ship is in column 4, the person drinking water must be in either column 1, 2, or 3.


But from clue 7, we already have soy-milk in column 2, so the person drinking water cannot be there. And since fanta is also in an even position (either column 2 or column 4), it's more likely that the person drinking water is in column 1 or column 3.


From clue 10, we know that the person driving the skateboard is to the left of the person drinking fanta. This means that the person driving the skateboard must be in either column 1 or column 2. But since soy-milk is already in column 2, the person driving the skateboard must be in column 1.


Now, from clue 4, we know that the Turkish is not the person drinking fanta. And since the Turkish is in an odd position (either column 1 or column 3), it's more likely that they are the one drinking almond-milk in column 1.


With these constraints, the rest of the puzzle falls into place:


The owner of the pony is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish (clue 14). Since the Turkish is already in column 1, and they can't be the owner of the goldfish (clue 1), it's more likely that the owner of the pony is also in column 1.


The person driving the bike is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig (clue 3). Since the owner of the rabbit is to the left or right of the owner of the guinea-pig (clue 2), it's more likely that the owner of the rabbit is in column 2.


The person driving the car must be in either column 1 or column 3. But since the Turkish is already in column 1, and they can't be the one driving the bike (clue 13), it's more likely that they are the one driving the car.


Putting all these pieces together, we get the final solution:

Lv6-4x4-5	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a possible solution for the puzzle:


|               |   1    |     2     |    3    |     4      |
| Beverage      | cola   | milk      | lemonade| fanta      |

| Nationality   | german | turkish   | brazilian| dutch      |
| Transport     | airplane| scooter   | subway    | taxi       |

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 3, we know the person drinking cola is on the far left. This gives us a starting point.

Clue 7 tells us that the person driving the airplane is to the right of the person drinking cola. Since cola is already on the far left, the airplane must be in position 2.

Now, let's look at clue 5, which states that the person driving the scooter is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade. We also know from clue 8 that the scooter driver is between the airplane and the Dutch. Given the arrangement so far, this means the scooter must be in position 3.

Clue 10 tells us that the person eating lime is to the left of the person drinking fanta. Since fanta is mentioned in several clues, it's likely in a later position. This also helps confirm that lime is in position 2 (as food), and radish (not associated with any other constraints) can fit in position 1.

Clue 9 reveals that the Dutch person drinks fanta, which puts them in position 4.

Now we can use clue 6 to place the Turkish person between the Fanta drinker (Dutch) and the Brazilian. This means the Turkish person must be in position 3. However, since the scooter driver is already in position 3, this creates a conflict. But wait! Clue 8 also states that the scooter driver is between the airplane and the Dutch. Since the airplane is in position 2, and the Dutch are in position 4, this means the scooter can actually be in either position 1 or 2. Given our previous arrangement, we can move the scooter to position 2 (replacing lime), and put the Turkish person in position 3 as required.

We're almost done! Clue 1 tells us that the strawberry eater is on the far left or right. Since the far left is already taken by cola and radish, this means strawberry must be in position 4. But wait again! We just established that Fanta (and Dutch) are in position 4. This conflict can be resolved if we swap positions 3 and 4 between lemonade (with blueberry food) and the Brazilian.

Finally, clue 11 confirms that radish is not associated with the Brazilian.

The resulting table should look like this:


|               |   1    |     2     |    3    |     4      |
| Beverage      | cola   | milk      | lemonade| fanta      |

Lv6-4x4-6	"Here is the solved table:


|               |     1      |      2       |    3    |    4    |
| Music-Genre   |  country   |      dubstep | salsa  | blues  |
| Pet           |   horse    |    lizard    | hamster| turtle |
| Sport         | biathlon   | snowboarding | soccer | sailing|
| Transport     |  scooter   |  motorbike   | taxi   |snowmobile|

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


From clue 6, we know that the owner of the turtle is a fan of blues. From clue 4, we also know that the owner of the turtle is to the right of the person driving the snowmobile.


From clue 2, we know that the fan of blues is on the left or right of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the owner of the turtle is already assigned as a fan of blues and is to the right of the person driving the snowmobile (clue 4), the person driving the snowmobile must be in column 3.


From clue 7, we know that the person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left of the person driving the taxi. Since the person driving the snowmobile is already assigned to column 3, and there can't be two people to the right of the person driving the snowmobile (clue 4), the person driving the taxi must be in column 4.


From clue 5, we know that the owner of the hamster is somewhere to the right of the person driving the taxi. Since the person driving the taxi is already assigned to column 4, this means that the owner of the hamster can't exist (there's no one to their right), so they must be in the same row as someone else.


From clue 9, we know that the owner of the hamster drives a scooter. Since there are only four rows and four columns, this means that column 2 is now filled by either motorbike or lizard (since hamster's owner is driving scooter in another row). But from clue 3, we know that the person driving the taxi is to the right of the owner of the horse, so the owner of the horse must be in a column to the left of the taxi driver.


Column 1 now has only two possibilities: country or salsa. But if salsa were in column 1, then from clue 11, we would have country in either column 2 or column 3 (which is already occupied by dubstep and snowmobile), so salsa can't be in column 1. Therefore, column 1 must contain the fan of country.


From clue 10, we know that the fan of salsa plays soccer. And since from clue 12, soccer player is to the left or right of taxi driver (in column 4), this means salsa fan can only be in column 3.


Dubstep now falls into place as it's the last remaining music-genre for column 2.


From clue 8, we know that horse owner is not snowboarding. Since horse must be to the left of taxi driver, and hamster can't exist in a separate row (see above), this means lizard has no other choice but to be paired with snowboarding in column 3.


From clue 1, we now know biathlon must go before snowboarding, which is already assigned to column 2. The only remaining pet for horse's owner is then either turtle or motorbike. But since from clue 4, turtle is on the right of snowmobile driver and there can't be two rows with people to their right (biathlon + taxi), we conclude that biathlete must drive a motorbike.


This leaves us with the person driving scooter as hamster's owner in column 1, which was previously occupied by country fan. Therefore, our final table looks like:


|               |     1      |      2       |    3    |    4    |

| Transport     |  scooter   |  motorbike   | taxi   |snowmobile|

Lv6-4x4-7	"I'll solve the logic puzzle step by step.


From clue 10, we know that the person watching martial-arts movies is on the far left or far right.

From clue 13 and 14, we can conclude that the person who's hobby is photography (far right) cannot be watching martial-arts movies. Also, the french (far right) cannot be watching martial-arts movies either.

Therefore, the person watching martial-arts movies must be on the far left.


We know from clue 9 that the person watching family movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching martial-arts movies.


From clue 11, we can conclude that the fan jazz and fan disco are not in column 1 (far left), since there must be someone between them.

Also, we know from clue 8 that the fan techno is the person who's hobby is skydiving. Therefore, the fan jazz cannot be on the far left.


So, we can place the person watching martial-arts movies and the person who's hobby is filmmaking (since they are related to each other through clues) in columns 1 and 2:


|               |      1       |      2      |     3      |      4      |

| Nationality   |              |             |            |             |

Now, let's analyze clues related to filmmaking:


From clue 2, we know that the dutch is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since the dutch cannot be in column 1 (due to clue 5 and the fact that photography is far right), they must be in either column 3 or 4.


Also, from clue 5, we know that the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is photography. However, since photography is far right, filmmaking cannot be in column 1 (due to clues related to other hobbies).


Now, let's analyze clues related to woodworking:


From clue 3 and 4, we can place the fan hip-hop and the person who's hobby is woodworking together.


We know that the chinese must watch satire movies from clue 7.


Since the dutch cannot be in column 1 or 2 (due to clues), they must be either german or french is not possible since the french is far right.


From clue 12, we can conclude that the person watching sports movies (french) is indeed on the far right. Therefore, the chinese must be somewhere to the left of the french.


Let's analyze the remaining information:


We know from clue 1 and 8 that the fan techno is in column 2 or 3, and the person who's hobby is skydiving is also in column 2 or 3.


From clue 6, we can conclude that the fan hip-hop (woodworking) must be on either side of the fan techno (skydiving).


Since woodworking is to the left of chinese from clue 3, we know that skydiving cannot be between them (as techno would then not be next to hip-hop). Therefore, the person who's hobby is woodworking and the fan hip-hop are in column 1 or 2.


However, woodworking cannot be in column 1 since it must be on the left of chinese. Also, chinese cannot be in column 3 as dutch will have nowhere to go (due to clue 2).


We can now finally solve the puzzle:


|               |      1       |      2      |     3      |      4      |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 4, the person eating corn is to the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since the person watching musical movies is also the person who's sport is snowboarding (clue 6), and they're eating eggplant (clue 11), we can start building a sequence: Corn -> Eggplant (Snowboarding/Musical)
* Clue 1 tells us that the Thai is to the left of the person whose sport is climbing. Since the person eating lettuce is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is climbing (clue 5), and we already have the sequence starting with Corn, it's likely that the Thai is associated with Corn.
* Clue 2 tells us that the person whose sport is sailing is on the right of the person whose sport is snowboarding. We can use this to determine the relative positions of Sailing and Snowboarding in the Sport row.
* From clue 7, we know the Malaysian is somewhere to the right of the Russian. Combining this with clue 10 (Russian is somewhere to the right of the person eating Corn), it's likely that the order for Nationality is: Thai -> Malaysian -> Japanese/Russian (not sure which one yet)
* Clue 9 tells us that the person whose sport is weightlifting is on either side of the person watching action movies. Since Weightlifting can't be next to Snowboarding/Musical (due to the sequence we've built), it's likely that Weightlifting is at position 1 or 3.
* Finally, clue 12 states that the person watching time-travel movies is in an even position. The only possible solution for this is if Time-Travel is at position 2.

Please note that there might be other possible solutions, but this one satisfies all the given conditions.

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning:

* Clue 8 suggests the Argentine is on the far left or right. Given other clues, it makes more sense for them to be on the far left.
* Clue 5 places the fan of Ambient music next to the person drinking Fanta. Since the Argentine is already in position 1, Fanta must also be in position 1.
* Clue 2 puts the Egyptian as a fan of Folk music, and clue 3 suggests the owner of the bird is somewhere to the right of the fan of Folk. This means the Egyptian can't be on the far right (position 4).
* Clues 9 and 12 suggest the Indonesian is next to both the person drinking Tea and the fan of R&B music. Given the other constraints, it's likely that the Indonesian is in position 2.
* Clue 7 eliminates the possibility of the fan of R&B being in an odd position (drinking milk). Therefore, the fan of R&B must be next to the Indonesian, which puts them in position 3 or not at all. Since clue 10 also places the fan of R&B next to the Indonesian, it's likely they're in position 3.
* Clue 1 links the person drinking Tea with the owner of the Guinea-Pig, and since the Egyptian is already in a fixed position, the only spot left for the tea drinker is position 4.
