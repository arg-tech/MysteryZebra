Lv6-5x3-1	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:

|               |    1     |       2       |      3      |
| Beverage      | hot-cho   | cola          | almond-milk |

| Transport     | van       | car           | ship        |
#############


Let me explain my reasoning:

From clue 5, the person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere to the left of the person driving the ship. Since there are only three columns, this means the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in column 1 or 2.

Clue 11 confirms that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person driving the ship, which further supports them being in column 1.

From clue 10, the person driving the ship is in an odd position, so they can only be in column 1 or 3. Since we already know the person drinking hot-chocolate is to their left, this means the person driving the ship must be in column 3.

Clue 6 says the chinese is on the far left or far right, but since there's someone driving a van in column 1 (to be determined later), the chinese can't be on the far left. Therefore, they must be on the far right, which means they're in column 3 and driving the ship.

From clue 2, the person drinking cola is on the left of the person driving the car. This means the person drinking cola must be in column 1 or 2.

Clue 7 says the person who's sport is biathlon is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola. Since we already know the person drinking hot-chocolate is in column 1, and they're not the one drinking cola (clue 5), this means the person drinking cola must be in column 2.

Clue 3 says the person who's sport is volleyball is in the middle, which puts them in column 2. But we already know someone in column 2 drinks cola! Since clue 4 says the person watching romance movies is not the person who's sport is biathlon, and clue 8 says the person watching romance movies is somewhere to the left of the person driving the car, it means the person drinking cola must be watching romance movies (column 2).

Now we can determine the rest:

* The person drinking hot-chocolate in column 1 is chinese (clue 6) and watches disaster movies (since the other two genres are taken).
* The person who's sport is biathlon must be to the right of the person drinking cola, so they're in column 3, but that spot is taken by the chinese. Therefore, they must be in column 1, which means they drive a van.
* The pakistani (last nationality) drives a car (since the other two transport are taken).
* The indian drinks cola (clue 1), so they must watch romance movies and play volleyball can't be their sport (since it's taken by column 2). Therefore, their sport is climbing.

And that's the solution!"

Lv6-5x3-3	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:

| Beverage      | mirinda   | almond-milk  | milk       |

| Transport     | taxi      | subway       | trike      |

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* From clue 5, we know the photographer is on the right of the owner of the frog. Since there are only three positions, the frog must be in position 1.
* Clue 8 tells us the bartender is on the left of the owner of the hamster. Combining this with clue 10, which says the hamster is to the right of the frog, we can deduce that the bartender is in position 1 and the hamster is in position 2.
* Clue 3 states the person driving the taxi is to the left of the freelancer. Since the taxi can't be in position 3 (because it's not on the right side), it must be in position 1 or 2. However, we already have the bartender and photographer in these positions, so the taxi must be in position 1.
* Clue 9 says the person drinking mirinda is to the left of the person driving the trike. This means mirinda can't be in position 3 (because there's no one to its right). Therefore, mirinda is in position 1, and the taxi is indeed associated with it.
* Clue 2 tells us the bartender is to the left of the person driving the subway. Since we already have the bartender in position 1, the subway must be in position 2 or 3. We can't put the subway in position 2 because that's where the hamster is (which is associated with a different transport). So, the subway is in position 2.
* Clue 11 states the person drinking milk is to the right of the person driving the trike. This means milk must be in position 3 (since there's no one to its right), and the trike must be in position 1 or 2. However, we already have a transport in each of these positions, so the trike must be in position 3.
* Clue 6 says the fan gospel is in an even position, which means it can only be in position 2. This also fits with clue 7, which states the freelancer is not the fan gospel (since we already have a job associated with each of the other positions).
* Finally, from clue 1, we know the fan country is to the right of the photographer. Since the photographer is in position 2, the fan country must be in position 3.

I hope this explanation helps clarify how I arrived at the solution! Let me know if you have any further questions.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 4, we know the Chinese is in an odd position, so they must be in either column 1 or 3.
* Clue 9 tells us that the fan of country music is also the person who plays lacrosse. Since lacrosse can't be in column 1 (due to cycling being on the left of watermelon), lacrosse must be in column 2, and therefore country music is associated with pear.
* From clue 10, we know the fan of country music eats pear, so pear must be in column 2.
* Clue 6 tells us that country music is to the right of western movies. Since country music is already associated with column 2, western movies must be in column 1 or 2. However, since disaster movies are also in an odd position (clue 5), western movies can't be in column 1, so they must be in column 2.
* Clue 7 tells us that superhero movies are to the left of handball. Since western movies are already in column 2, superhero movies must be in column 3.
* From clue 8, we know funk is not associated with Chinese nationality. Clue 6 also tells us that country music is not associated with Indian nationality (since it's to the right of western movies). Therefore, funk must be associated with Pakistani nationality.
* Finally, since cycling is on the left of watermelon (clue 1), and watermelon can't be in column 1 (due to carrot being the only remaining option for food in column 1), watermelon must be in column 3.

Lv6-5x3-5	"Let's start solving the puzzle step by step.


From clue 7, we know that the person who eats zucchini also has chess as a hobby.


From clue 1, we know that the person who has chess as a hobby is to the right of the person eating kale. Since the person eating zucchini has chess as a hobby, the person eating kale must be in column 1 or 2.


From clue 4, we know that the Pakistani owns a fish. From clue 5, we know that the owner of the guinea-pig is to the right of the Pakistani.


Now, let's consider the possible positions for the Pakistani and the owner of the guinea-pig:


Case 1: Pakistani in column 1 and owner of guinea-pig in column 2


In this case, the person eating kale must be in column 3 (since the person who has chess as a hobby is to the right of the person eating kale). However, this contradicts clue 5.


Therefore, Case 1 is not possible.


Case 2: Pakistani in column 2 and owner of guinea-pig in column 3


In this case, the person eating kale can be in column 1. This satisfies all clues so far.


From clue 6, we know that the person who has chess as a hobby (who eats zucchini) is to the left of the person who has reading as a hobby. Since the person who has chess as a hobby is in column 2 or 3, and the Pakistani is in column 2, the person who has chess as a hobby must be in column 2.


Now we can fill in some more information:


|               |      1      |     2     |     3      |

| Pet           |             | fish     | guinea-pig|


From clue 8, we know that the person watching thriller movies is to the right of the Turkish. Since the person who eats kale must be in column 1, and there are no more columns left for the Turkish, the Turkish must be in column 3.


We also know from clue 3 that the person watching documentary movies is to the left of the Pakistani. Therefore, the person watching documentary movies must be in column 1.


Now we can fill in some more information:


|               |      1      |     2     |     3      |

| Nationality   | australian | Pakistani| Turkish   |
| Pet           |             | fish     | guinea-pig|


From clue 2, we know that the Pakistani is not watching documentary movies.


Now we can fill in some more information:


|               |      1      |     2     |     3      |

| Nationality   | australian | Pakistani| Turkish   |
| Pet           |             | fish     | guinea-pig|


The only remaining hobby is reading, which must be in column 3.

Here's how I solved it:

From statement 6, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is in the middle. From statement 7, we know that this person is not a fan of jazz. This means the person in column 2 must be a fan of indie music (since house and jazz are already taken).

Statement 5 tells us that the musician is on the right of the person drinking water. Since the musician can't be in column 1, they must be in column 3. Therefore, the person drinking water is in column 2.

From statement 8, we know that the accountant is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk. This means the accountant is either in column 1 or 2, and the person drinking soy-milk is in column 2.

Statement 4 tells us that the person driving the trike is on the right of the fan indie. Since we already know the fan indie is in column 2, the person driving the trike must be in column 3.

From statement 2, we know that the person who's sport is skiing is the person driving the bike. Statement 6 tells us that this person can't be in the middle, so they must be in column 3 (since the person driving the trike is also in column 3).

Statement 1 tells us that the person who's sport is baseball is on the left of the fan house. Since we already know the fan house is somewhere to the right of the person drinking sprite (statement 9), this means the person drinking sprite must be in column 1.

Putting it all together, we get the final solution:

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

* Clue 7 tells us that the Chinese is on the left of the fan R&B, so the Chinese must be in column 1.
* Clue 3 tells us that the person drinking soy-milk is to the right of the Chinese, so the person drinking soy-milk must be in column 2 or 3. Since clue 6 tells us that the person drinking sprite is to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate, we can deduce that the person drinking hot-chocolate is in column 1.
* Clue 8 tells us that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the fan R&B. Since the Chinese (in column 1) is to the left of the fan R&B, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing must be in column 2 or 3.
* Clue 5 tells us that the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the fan blues. Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is already placed in column 2 or 3, the fan blues must be in column 1 or 2. But clue 7 tells us that the Chinese (in column 1) is to the left of the fan R&B, so the fan blues must be in column 2.
* Clue 4 tells us that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person who's sport is basketball. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is already placed in column 1, the person who's sport is basketball must be in column 1.
* Clue 6 tells us that the person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate, so the person drinking sprite must be in column 2 or 3. But clue 5 tells us that the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the fan blues (in column 2), and since the person who's hobby is woodworking has not been placed yet, the person who's hobby is woodworking must be in column 3.
* Clue 1 tells us that the fan reggae is the Turkish. Since the Turkish must be in column 3 (because of clue 5 and the placement of the other nationalities), we can deduce that the fan reggae is also in column 3.

1. From clue 6, we know that the person who's hobby is baking drinks coffee.
2. From clue 5, we know that the person drinking coffee is on the far left or far right. Since the person who's hobby is baking can't be in position 3 (due to the train clue), they must be in position 1.
3. Clue 4 tells us that the roller is on the left of the train, so we place it in position 1 as well.
4. From clue 9, we know that the freelancer is on the left of the turkish. Since the american can't be in position 2 (due to the journalist clue), they must be a freelancer and be in position 1.
5. Clue 3 tells us that the journalist is between the french and the person drinking almond-milk. This means that the french must be in position 2, and the journalist in position 2 as well.
6. From clue 7, we know that the board-games hobby is between skydiving and coffee. Since coffee is in position 1, this means that board-games must be in position 2.
7. Clue 10 tells us that the person who's hobby is skydiving drives the tram. This means that they can't be in position 1 or 2 (due to the train clue), so they must be in position 3.
8. From clue 8, we know that the juice drinker is on the left or right of the tram driver. Since coffee and almond-milk are already taken, this means that the person drinking juice must be in position 3 as well.
9. Finally, from clue 2, we know that the turkish person doesn't have a baking hobby. This means that they can only be in position 3, which is the last remaining nationality spot.

This means that ""Adventure"" cannot be in column 1 (since it would have to be next to the helicopter), and must instead be in column 3.
* Clue 2 states that the person who likes woodworking is between the person driving a helicopter and the fan of electronic music. Since we already know that the helicopter is not in column 3 (because ""Adventure"" is there), this means that ""Woodworking"" and ""Electronic"" must be in columns 1 and 2, respectively.
* Clue 5 states that the person who likes drawing is to the left or right of the fan of hip-hop music. We also know from clue 9 that the fan of hip-hop music is to the left or right of the person eating lime. This means that ""Drawing"" must be in column 2 (since it cannot be next to both ""Lime"" and ""Hip-Hop""), and ""Lime"" and ""Hip-Hop"" must be in columns 1 and 3, respectively.
* Finally, clue 6 tells us that the person driving a trike is to the right of the person driving a car. This means that ""Trike"" must be in column 3, and ""Car"" must be in column 2.

Putting all these pieces together gives us the final solution table above!"
