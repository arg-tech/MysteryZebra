Final Solution:


#############
Here is a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve this puzzle:

1. First, I looked for unique combinations that could be determined from the given clues.
2. From clue 28, I knew that lime was on the far left, and from clue 36, action movies were also on the far left.
3. Clue 46 told me that the dog owner was to the right of puzzles, which helped determine some other combinations.
4. The combination of clues 10, 17, 25, and others helped establish a fixed sequence for some rows.
5. After establishing several sequences, I looked for connections between them using various clues (e.g., food rows with music-genre rows).
6. Finally, I used the most restrictive clues to fill in any remaining gaps.

I hope this explanation helps!"

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:

I started by using the most restrictive clues, such as those that specified exact positions or relationships between elements. For example, clue #40 says that the person who's sport is water-polo is in an odd position, which means they must be in either column 1, 3, or 5. Similarly, clue #22 says that the person watching fantasy movies is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing, so I could place these two elements together.

I then used a process of elimination to fill in the remaining cells, making sure to satisfy all the given constraints. For example, if a clue said that one element was to the left or right of another, I would make sure to leave space for both elements in the corresponding columns.

As I filled in more and more cells, the possibilities became increasingly constrained, and it became easier to figure out where each remaining element could go. In some cases, I had to use trial and error to see which options worked best, but ultimately, the puzzle was solvable using a combination of logic and deduction."

Please note that the solution table is quite large, so I had to split it into two parts.


Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:

I started by using the given clues to build a framework for the solution. Clues like ""the person who's hobby is gardening is on the far left"" and ""the owner of the pony is in an even position"" helped me establish some initial positions.

From there, I used a combination of logical deductions and process of elimination to fill in the remaining blanks. For example, clue 3 states that ""the person drinking 7up is on the right of the person who's sport is water-polo"", which allowed me to place the person drinking 7up in relation to the person who's sport is water-polo.

I continued this process, using each clue to build upon previous deductions and fill in more positions. Eventually, I was able to complete the entire table.

* Clue 18 tells us that the fan rock is in an odd position, and clue 20 tells us that the person drinking 7up is on the left of the fan rock. This means that the fan rock must be in position 3 or 5.
* From clues 25 and 27, we can deduce that the person drinking fanta is somewhere to the left of the person drinking tea, and the person eating orange is on the right of the person eating plum.
* Clue 48 tells us that the person who's sport is handball is on the left or right of the fan rock. Since the fan rock is in position 3 or 5, this means that the person who's sport is handball must be in position 2 or 4.
