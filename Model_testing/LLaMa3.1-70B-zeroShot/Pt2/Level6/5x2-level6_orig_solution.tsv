From clue 4, we know the photographer is on the right of the Chinese. Let's place the Chinese in column 1:


|               |    1     |      2       |

Now, from clue 3, we know the nurse is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the nurse is already in column 1, the person with the hobby skydiving must be in column 2:


|               |    1     |      2       |

| Nationality   | Chinese  | Pakistani   |
| Transport     | Bike     | Van         |

From clue 2, we know the person drinking soy-milk is not the Chinese. Since there are only two beverages and two nationalities left, the Chinese must drink lemonade:


|               |    1     |      2       |
| Beverage      | Lemonade |              |

| Nationality   | Chinese  | Pakistani   |
| Transport     | Bike     | Van         |

Now, the only beverage left is soy-milk, which must be the favourite of the person in column 2:

Lv6-5x2-2	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |     1      |    2     |
| Hobby         | camping    | skydiving|
| Music-Genre   | soul       | jazz     |

| Sport         | ice-hockey | biathlon |
| Transport     | motorbike  | bike     |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 3, we know that the person who enjoys biathlon is to the right of the person who enjoys skydiving. Since there are only two people, this means that the person who enjoys biathlon must be in column 2.

From clue 1, we know that the fan of soul music is to the left of the person who drives a bike. This implies that the person who enjoys soul music cannot drive a bike (since they would then be on the same side). Therefore, the person who enjoys soul music must be in column 1 and drive a motorbike.

From clue 2, we know that the owner of the fish is not the person who enjoys biathlon. Since the person who enjoys biathlon is already assigned to column 2, this means that the owner of the fish must also be in column 1 (to avoid being the same person).

The only remaining hobby is camping, which can be assigned to column 1. The only remaining pet is the mouse, which can be assigned to column 1.

Finally, we can assign ice-hockey and bike to column 1, since they are the only remaining options.

Lv6-5x2-3	"After solving the puzzle, I arrived at the following solution:


#############
|               |     1     |    2     |
| Hobby         | baking   | chess   |
| Music-Genre   | dubstep | rock    |
| Nationality   | argentine| nigerian|
| Pet           | hedgehog | rat     |
| Sport         | rowing   | tennis  |
#############

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

From clue 1, we know that the owner of the rat is a fan of rock music.

From clue 2, we can deduce that the person who enjoys tennis (right column) must be next to the person who has baking as a hobby (left column).

Clue 3 states that the fan of dubstep is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rat. Since the owner of the rat is in the right column, this means that the fan of dubstep must be in the left column.

Now we have two possible arrangements for columns 1 and 2:


| Hobby         | baking   | chess   |
| Music-Genre   | ?       | rock    |

or


| Hobby         | chess   | baking   |
| Music-Genre   | ?       | rock    |

From clue 4, we know that the Nigerian is not the person who enjoys rowing. This means that the Argentine must enjoy rowing (since there are only two nationalities).

Now let's combine this information with the possible arrangements above.


If we choose the first arrangement:


| Hobby         | baking   | chess   |
| Music-Genre   | ?       | rock    |
| Nationality   | argentine| nigerian|
| Pet           | ?       | rat     |
| Sport         | rowing   | tennis  |

The person who enjoys tennis (right column) must be next to the person who has baking as a hobby (left column). This means that the Nigerian cannot enjoy chess, so they must have baking as their hobby.


However, this would mean that the Argentine is in the right column, which contradicts clue 2. Therefore, we reject this arrangement.


Now let's try the second arrangement:


| Hobby         | chess   | baking   |
| Music-Genre   | ?       | rock    |
| Nationality   | argentine| nigerian|
| Pet           | ?       | rat     |
| Sport         | rowing   | tennis  |

The person who enjoys tennis (right column) must be next to the person who has baking as a hobby (left column). This means that the Nigerian can have baking as their hobby.


The Argentine is in the left column, which means they enjoy rowing. We also know that the fan of dubstep is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rat (who enjoys rock music), so the Argentine must be a fan of dubstep.


Finally, we can fill in the remaining gaps:


| Hobby         | baking   | chess   |
| Music-Genre   | dubstep | rock    |
| Nationality   | argentine| nigerian|
| Pet           | hedgehog | rat     |
| Sport         | rowing   | tennis  |

This arrangement satisfies all the clues, so we have found the solution!"
Lv6-5x2-4	"After analyzing the clues, I've filled in the table with the solution:


|               |      1      |      2       |
| Food          | carrot     | grapes    |
| Hobby         | skydiving  | card-games|
| Job           | firefighter| entrepreneur|
| Movie-Genre   | animation  | satire    |
| Nationality   | indonesian| argentine |


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 2, we know the entrepreneur is on the far right, so that goes in column 2.
* From clue 3, we know the Argentine is not the firefighter. Since there are only two nationalities and jobs, this means the Argentine must be paired with the entrepreneur (column 2).
* From clues 1 and 4, we know the person eating carrot and watching animation movies is to the left of the person who's hobby is card-games. This puts the carrot and animation in column 1.
* The remaining hobbies, skydiving and card-games, must be paired with the remaining columns, so skydiving goes in column 1.
* Finally, the firefighter (from clue 2) must go in column 1 to avoid being paired with the Argentine.

Lv6-5x2-5	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 4, we know that the person playing chess is on the left of the person taking the train.

| Transport     |            | Train      |

From clue 3, we know that the person drinking Fanta is not eating plum. Let's assume the person playing chess is eating plum (we'll come back to this later if needed).

|               |     1      |      2      |
| Beverage      |            |             |

| Music-Genre   |            |             |
| Transport     |            | Train      |

From clue 2, we know that the fan of electronic music is on the left or right of the person drinking Fanta. Since the person playing chess is already on the left, the fan of electronic music must be on the right.

|               |     1      |      2      |
| Beverage      |            |             |
| Food          | Plum    |             |
| Hobby         | Chess    |             |
| Music-Genre   |            | Electronic |
| Transport     |            | Train      |

From clue 1, we know that the person whose hobby is woodworking is not a fan of electronic music. Therefore, the person playing chess must be on the left of the person who likes woodworking.

 Wait, what? That's not possible! We already have the person playing chess on the left of the person taking the train. This means our initial assumption about the person playing chess eating plum might be wrong.

Let's try again. What if the person playing chess is drinking water and eating potato?

|               |     1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | Water   |             |
| Food          | Potato |             |
| Hobby         | Chess    |             |
| Music-Genre   |            |             |
| Transport     |            | Train      |

From clue 3, we know that the person drinking Fanta is not eating plum. So, the person on the right must be drinking Fanta and eating potato doesn't work (since chess player already eats potato). The person on the right must eat plum.

|               |     1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | Water   | Fanta    |
| Food          | Potato | Plum    |
| Hobby         | Chess    |             |
| Music-Genre   |            |             |
| Transport     |            | Train      |

From clue 2, we know that the fan of electronic music is on the left or right of the person drinking Fanta. Since the chess player is already on the left, and woodworking doesn't fit (due to clue 1), the person playing chess must be the fan of reggae.

|               |     1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | Water   | Fanta    |

| Music-Genre   | Reggae  |             |
| Transport     |            | Train      |

From clue 1, we know that the person whose hobby is woodworking is not a fan of electronic music. Therefore, the person on the right must be the fan of electronic music and their hobby is woodworking.

|               |     1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | Water   | Fanta    |
| Food          | Potato | Plum    |
| Hobby         | Chess    | Woodworking|
| Music-Genre   | Reggae  | Electronic |
| Transport     |            | Train      |

Finally, from the remaining options, we can conclude that the person on the left takes the bus.

####################


Here's how the clues led me to this solution:

1. The person drinking Sprite is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is gardening.
	* This means that Sprite must be in either column 1 or 2, and Gardening must be in either column 1 or 2 as well. Since there are only two columns, it's likely that they're adjacent to each other.
2. The fan of D&B is on the left of the person eating Lettuce.
	* This means that D&B must be in column 1, and Lettuce must be in column 2.
3. The person drinking Almond-milk is not the fan of D&B.
	* Since D&B is already in column 1, Almond-milk must be in column 2 to avoid being associated with D&B.
4. The person watching Horror movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching Scientific movies.
	* This means that Horror must be in column 1, and Scientific must be in column 2.

Putting it all together:

* Column 1: Sprite (to satisfy clue 1), Traveling (as the only remaining hobby), Horror (to satisfy clue 4), and D&B (to satisfy clues 2 and 3).
* Column 2: Almond-milk, Spinach (as the only remaining food), Gardening (to satisfy clue 1), Scientific (to satisfy clue 4), and Soul (as the only remaining music genre)."

| Sport         | snowboarding| basketball |


Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


1. The person who's hobby is photography is not the person who's sport is basketball.
	* This clue tells us that photography cannot be paired with basketball.

2. The fan of house is on the left of the person who's hobby is collecting.
	* Since there are only two options for music-genre, this means that house must be paired with collecting, and salsa must be paired with photography (since it can't be on the left).

3. The person who's hobby is collecting is not the person watching adventure movies.
	* This clue tells us that collecting cannot be paired with adventure.

4. The person watching adventure movies is the owner of the ferret.
	* Now we know that adventure must be paired with ferret.

Considering all these clues, we can fill in the table:


The person who likes photography has salsa music and owns a snake (to avoid pairing with basketball). They also like thriller movies and snowboarding.


The person who likes collecting has house music and owns a ferret. They also like adventure movies and basketball.

After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |     1      |       2       |
| Food          | pumpkin    | carrot        |
| Hobby         | card-games | rock-climbing |
| Nationality   | australian | american      |
| Pet           | hedgehog   | fish          |
| Transport     | car        | tram          |
#############


Here's how I derived the solution:

From clue 1, the person with the hobby ""card-games"" is on the far left, so column 1 has card-games as the hobby.

From clue 3, the american is in an even position, which means they must be in column 2.

From clue 4, the person eating carrot is somewhere to the right of the owner of the fish. Since there are only two columns, this means the person eating carrot must be in column 2, and the owner of the fish must be in column 1.

Now we have:


|               |     1      |       2       |
| Food          |            | carrot        |
| Hobby         | card-games |               |
| Nationality   |            | american      |
| Pet           |            |               |
| Transport     |            |               |

From clue 5, the person driving the car is not the owner of the fish. Since we already know the owner of the fish is in column 1, this means the person driving the car must be in column 2.

Now we have:


|               |     1      |       2       |
| Food          |            | carrot        |
| Hobby         | card-games |               |
| Nationality   |            | american      |
| Pet           | fish       |               |
| Transport     |            | car           |

The only hobby left for column 2 is rock-climbing. The person in column 1 must be eating pumpkin, since the other food (carrot) is already assigned to column 2.

Finally, we can assign a pet to the person in column 1. Since they're not the owner of the fish, it must be the hedgehog.


The final solution is:

|               |     1      |       2       |
| Food          | pumpkin    | carrot        |
| Hobby         | card-games | rock-climbing |
| Nationality   | australian | american      |
| Pet           | hedgehog   | fish          |
| Transport     | car        | tram          |
