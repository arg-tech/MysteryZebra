Lv6-4x3-2	"After analyzing the clues, I was able to fill in the table as follows:


#############
|               |     1      |      2      |     3      |
| Food          | Nectarine  | Cauliflower | Onion     |
| Job           | Dressmaker| Architect    | Doctor     |
| Nationality   | Japanese  | Spanish      | American   |
| Transport     | Skateboard| Motorbike    | Car        |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning:

From clue 7, we know the Japanese is between the person driving the skateboard and the Spanish. This means the Japanese must be in column 2.

Clue 5 tells us that the Japanese is eating cauliflower, so we can fill in the food for column 2.

Clue 1 states that the person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the Spanish, which means the motorbike cannot be in column 1. Clue 7 also implies that the skateboard is not driven by the Spanish, so it must be in column 1, with the Japanese and cauliflower in column 2.

From clue 4, we know the doctor is to the right of the dressmaker. Since the Japanese (in column 2) cannot be a doctor (clue 3), the doctor must be in column 3. The dressmaker must then be in either column 1 or 2.

Clue 2 states that the person eating onion is somewhere to the left of the person eating cauliflower, which means the onion eater must be in column 1 or 3. Since we already have the skateboard and nectarine in column 1, it's more likely that the onion eater is in column 3.

Clue 8 tells us that the American is not the person eating onion, so the American must be either the dressmaker or the doctor in column 3 (which would mean they're eating onion). However, clue 6 states that the doctor is not driving a skateboard, which means the car driver (in column 3) cannot be the doctor. Thus, the American must be the person eating nectarine (column 1), and the doctor in column 3.

Finally, we can fill in the remaining blanks: the architect is likely to be the Japanese (since the other two jobs have been accounted for), which leaves the Spanish as the motorbike driver in column 2."
Lv6-4x3-3	"Here is the solved puzzle:


|               |     1      |       2       |       3        |
| Hobby         | fishing   | writing    | rock-climbing|
| Job           | mechanic  | scientist  | security-guard|
| Music-Genre   | country   | electronic| punk         |
| Pet           | chinchilla| frog     | snake       |

 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 4, we know the fan country is somewhere to the left of the security-guard. From clue 5, we know the person who's hobby is writing is not the fan country. Therefore, the fan country must be in column 1.

From clue 6, we know the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since there are only three columns, the person with the hobby fishing must be in column 1, and the person with the hobby rock-climbing must be in column 3.

From clue 2, we know the fan country is between the owner of the frog and the fan electronic. Therefore, the fan electronic must be in column 3, but since the fan punk is also in column 3 (from clue 1), this means that the fan electronic is actually in column 2.

From clue 7, we know the mechanic is on the left or right of the security-guard. Since the person with the hobby fishing is already in column 1, and the security-guard must be in column 3, the mechanic must also be in column 1.

The only pet left to place is the snake, which must be owned by the scientist (since the owner of the frog can't be in column 2).

Finally, from clue 8, we know the owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the security-guard. Since the mechanic is already on the left of the security-guard, and the owner of the snake (the scientist) must be in column 2, this means that the owner of the chinchilla must also be in column 1.

The final solution table is:

Lv6-4x3-4	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |     1     |    2     |     3     |
| Hobby         | Gardening | Puzzles  | Reading   |
| Job           | Bartender | Musician | Pilot     |
| Music-Genre   | House      | Classical| Hip-Hop   |
| Nationality   | French     | Canadian | Mexican   |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 2, we know the French is on the left of the Mexican, so they must be in columns 1 and 3.

Clue 3 tells us that the fan of House music is the French, which means column 1 has House as its music genre.

Clue 4 states that the fan of Hip-Hop is to the right of the French, so it must be in column 3.

Now we know columns 1 and 3 have House and Hip-Hop respectively. Clue 1 says the musician is between the Canadian and the fan of Hip-Hop, which means the Canadian must be in column 2 (the only position that allows for this).

With the nationalities settled, let's move on to jobs:

Clue 7 states that the bartender is on the left of the person who's hobby is reading. Since we know columns 1 and 3 have House and Hip-Hop respectively, and the French has a music genre already assigned (House), column 2 must be where reading falls (as it cannot fall in column 1 due to clue 6).

This places the bartender in column 1.

Now for hobbies:

Clue 5 tells us that the musician is not the person whose hobby is puzzles, which means columns 1 and 3 have either gardening or reading. Clue 6 says reading falls on the right of puzzles, so we must have: 
Puzzles -> Reading
In column order (we know reading is in column 2), this implies Puzzles is in column 1.

However, from clue 7, we already determined that the bartender is in column 1. So it's more likely that gardening falls in column 1 and puzzles in column 3 wouldn't work because of the constraint with reading (clue 6). Therefore, it must be Gardening -> Puzzles.

Column 2 has reading, as per clue 6, which confirms our earlier deduction.

Clue 5 now implies that musician cannot have a hobby of puzzles. With gardening already taken for column 1 and reading in column 2 (and confirmed by clues), the only remaining option is for the person with puzzle as their hobby to be associated with column 3's job - pilot.



This leaves us with our final solution:

Lv6-4x3-5	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table.


From clue 1, we know the owner of the chinchilla is to the left of the lawyer.


From clue 3, we know the owner of the horse is on either side of the person eating spinach.


From clue 5, we know the person eating apple is on either side of the lawyer.


Now, let's look at clue 2: the person eating spinach is between the videographer and the fan of techno. This means the person eating spinach cannot be in position 1 (because there's no one to their left), so they must be in position 2 or 3.


If the person eating spinach is in position 2, then the owner of the horse would have to be in position 1 (to be on either side of the person eating spinach). But this contradicts clue 5, because there's no one for the person eating apple to be on either side of.


So, the person eating spinach must be in position 3. This means the owner of the horse is in position 2 or 4 (but since there are only three positions, it must be 2).


Now we can use clue 6: the fan of blues is to the right of the videographer. Since the person eating spinach is in position 3, the videographer must be in position 1.


From clue 4, we know the fan of dubstep isn't eating apple. Let's assume they're eating grapes or spinach (we'll come back to this later).


The only job left for position 2 is the lawyer, and from clue 1, we know the owner of the chinchilla is to their left. So, the videographer owns a pet other than the horse (which is in position 2), so they must own the goat.


We also know the person eating apple isn't the fan of dubstep, so it's either grapes or techno for them. But if they're eating techno, then that would mean the spinach-eater has to be on either side of the techno fan (from clue 2), which is impossible since they're in position 3 already.


So, we have:


|               |      1       |    2    |      3       |
| Food          |              |         |              |
| Job           | videographer | lawyer  |              |
| Music-Genre   |              |         |              |
| Pet           | goat         | horse   |              |

Now, let's go back to the person eating grapes or spinach. If they're eating spinach, then from clue 2, the techno fan is in position 1 or 3, but since the videographer is already in position 1, it must be position 3.


This would mean the person eating apple has to eat it in position 2 (the only spot left), which contradicts clue 5.


So, the person eating grapes or spinach can't be eating spinach. This means they're eating grapes.


Also, since there's no one for the blues fan to be on either side of, we know that techno and dubstep must be in positions 1 and 3 respectively (so that the blues fan can be on their right).


We also know from clue 5 that apple has to be next to lawyer, which is position 2.


Lastly, since the chinchilla owner has to be on the left of lawyer and there's no other pet left for them except chinchilla itself, we get:

| Transport     | tram   | van        | motorbike    |
#############


Here's how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 5, we know baseball is on the far right, so it goes in column 3.
* Clue 4 tells us rugby is to the left of the person driving the van. Since baseball is already in column 3, rugby must be in column 1.
* Clue 8 says corn is to the left of the person driving the van. Since rugby is already in column 1, corn must also be in column 1.
* From clue 2, we know country music goes with the motorbike. Since the motorbike can't be in column 3 (already occupied by baseball), it must go in column 2 or 3. Clue 7 says the motorbike is to the right of the fan soul, so the motorbike must go in column 3.
* Clue 6 tells us soul music is to the right of rugby, which means soul music goes in column 2 (since rugby is already in column 1).
* From clue 3, we know van doesn't go with baseball. Since van can't be in column 1 (already occupied by corn and rugby) or column 3 (already occupied by motorbike), it must go in column 2.
* Clue 1 tells us biathlon goes with garlic. Biathlon can only fit in column 2, so garlic must also be in column 2.

Putting all the clues together gives us the final solution table:

| Pet           | turtle | chinchilla |  dog   |
| Transport     | tram   |    subway  |  ship  |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 1, the person eating apple drives the tram. From clue 3, this person is also a fan of reggae.

Clue 2 states that the person eating apple is on the far left or far right, and since they drive the tram (which is not likely to be in the middle), I placed them on the left side.

From clue 6, the fan of d&b is in the middle. Clue 7 says this person does not drive the ship, so they must use either the subway or be in the middle with no transport assigned yet (but that's unlikely).

Clue 5 states that the fan of house is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the person eating apple is already on the left, I placed the fan of house on the right side.

From clue 8, the person eating banana is next to the person eating apple. Clue 4 says the owner of the turtle is to the right of the person eating potato, so I swapped these two around.

This solution seems to satisfy all the clues:

| Movie-Genre   | Martial-Arts | Adventure | Comedy    |

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


From clue 2, we know the Italian is on the left or right of the person watching comedy movies.
From clue 7, we know the person watching martial-arts movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching comedy movies. Combining these two clues, we can conclude that the Italian must be on the right of the person watching comedy movies.


Now, let's look at clue 1: ""the italian is not the fan rock"". This means the Italian cannot be in position 2 or 3 (since Rock is the only music genre left). Therefore, the Italian must be in position 3.


From clue 4, we know the person watching adventure movies is between the owner of the cat and the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the Italian is already in position 3, this means the person watching adventure movies must be in position 2.


Clue 5 states that ""the argentine is on the left or right of the fan dubstep"". Clue 6 says ""the argentine is somewhere to the right of the fan punk"". Combining these two clues, we can conclude that the Argentine cannot be in position 1 (since Punk would have to be in position 2 or 3). Therefore, the Argentine must be in position 2.


From clue 4, we know the person watching adventure movies is between the owner of the cat and the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the Argentine is already in position 2, this means the person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 1.


Now, let's look at the remaining options:


* The person watching martial-arts movies is not the owner of the mouse (clue 3), so the mouse must belong to either position 2 or 3. Since the Argentine already has Dubstep, the mouse must belong to the Egyptian in position 1.

| Transport     | skateboard| car        | airplane  |

#############

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning:

* Clue 8 tells us that the person eating banana is on the far right, so banana goes in column 3.
* Clue 2 tells us that the person watching drama movies also has rowing as their sport. Since ice-hockey must be in an even position (clue 7), it can't be in column 1, which means parkour must be in column 1. Therefore, rowing is in column 2.
* Clue 6 tells us that the person watching drama movies (and doing rowing) is to the left of the person eating nectarine. Since banana is already on the far right, nectarine must be in column 2, and zucchini must be in column 1.
* Clue 3 tells us that the person doing ice-hockey is to the right of the person eating zucchini. Since zucchini is in column 1, ice-hockey must be in column 3 or 2, but we already know it's in an even position (clue 7), so it must be in column 2.
* However, this creates a conflict with clue 6, which tells us that the person doing rowing is to the left of the person eating nectarine. To resolve this, we need to swap the positions of ice-hockey and rowing, but then we'd have two people doing sports in column 2, which isn't allowed. Therefore, ice-hockey must be in column 3, which means horror movies are also in column 3 (since banana is already there).
* Clue 1 tells us that the person driving the airplane is to the right of the person watching horror movies. Since horror movies are in column 3, the airplane must also be in column 3.
* Clue 5 tells us that the person driving the airplane is to the right of the person driving the skateboard. Since the airplane is already in column 3, the skateboard must be in column 1 or 2. However, clue 4 tells us that the person driving the skateboard isn't watching horror movies, so it can't be in column 3. Therefore, the skateboard must be in column 1.
* Finally, the only remaining movie-genre is superhero, which goes in column 1.

I hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."
