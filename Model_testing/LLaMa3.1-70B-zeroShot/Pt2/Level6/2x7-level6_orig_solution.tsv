Explanation:


From clues 7 and 10, we know the Australian is on the left of the Japanese, and the Japanese is on the right of the fan hip-hop. Since there are no other nationalities between them (clue 6), we can place the Australian at position 1 with hip-hop as their preferred music genre.

From clue 14, we know the Malaysian prefers house music, and from clue 17, the French is on the right of the fan house. Clues 4 and 15 indicate that the fan house (Malaysian) is to the left of the French and the Japanese is to the left of the fan house. This gives us a sequence: Australian -> Japanese -> Malaysian -> French.

From clue 2, we know the Japanese doesn't prefer d&b, but from clue 1, the German doesn't either. However, clues 8 and 3 indicate that the German is on the left or right of the fan classical (who must be at position 7). Therefore, the German can only be at position 6 with d&b as their preferred music genre.

From clue 5, we know the French is somewhere to the left of the Thai. Clue 16 also states that the fan pop is to the right of the Canadian, and since there's no other nationality between the Canadian and the Thai (clue 20), we can place the Canadian at position 2 with trance as their preferred music genre.

Clues 9 and 13 indicate that the fan pop is to the right of the fan d&b, who in turn is to the right of the fan hip-hop. Since the Australian prefers hip-hop (position 1) and the Japanese is on the right of the fan hip-hop (clue 10), we can place the Japanese at position 2 with soul as their preferred music genre.

However, this would mean there's no one who prefers pop music, which contradicts clue 3. Therefore, we need to adjust our previous assumptions: the Canadian must be at position 2 with trance, and the German (who doesn't prefer d&b) is actually at position 6 but has a different music genre.

Since the fan house is already assigned to the Malaysian, clues 18 and 19 indicate that the fan d&b is on the right of the fan trance. Clue 9 also states that the fan pop is to the right of the fan d&b. Given these constraints and previous assignments, we can deduce that:


- The Canadian prefers trance at position 2.
- The Australian prefers hip-hop at position 1.
- The Japanese is on the right of the fan hip-hop (position 1) but doesn't prefer soul; instead, they're at position 5 with no music genre assigned yet.
- The Malaysian prefers house at position 4.
- The French is to the left of the Thai and has a different music genre than house or pop.

From clue 20, we know the fan soul is on the right of the fan hip-hop. Clue 21 states that the fan soul is to the left of the Malaysian (position 4). Therefore, the fan soul must be at position 3.


The only remaining nationality is the Thai, who can only fit in position 5 with no music genre assigned yet. From clue 5, we know the French is somewhere to the left of the Thai; therefore, the French must prefer pop at position 5 (clue 3). However, this contradicts our previous assumption that the fan pop was on the right of the Canadian.


Re-evaluating our assumptions:


- The Australian prefers hip-hop at position 1.
- The Canadian prefers trance at position 2.
- The Japanese is on the right of the fan hip-hop but doesn't prefer soul; instead, they're at position 3 with soul as their preferred music genre (clues 10 and 20).
- The Malaysian prefers house at position 4.
- The French can only fit in position 6 but has a different music genre than house or pop.

From clue 8, we know the German is on the left or right of the fan classical. Clue 3 indicates that the fan pop is to the right of the fan soul (position 3). Given these constraints and previous assignments:


- The Australian prefers hip-hop at position 1.
- The Canadian prefers trance at position 2.
- The Japanese prefers soul at position 3.
- The Malaysian prefers house at position 4.
- The Thai can only fit in position 5 with pop as their preferred music genre (clues 9 and 16).
- The German is on the left or right of the fan classical; since the German doesn't prefer d&b (clue 1) but must be near the fan classical, they must prefer none at position 6.
- The French prefers none but has a different music genre than house or pop; therefore, they're not assigned any specific music genre in this solution.

After re-evaluating our assumptions and following the logical deductions:

Based on the given information, here's a step-by-step solution:


From clue 5, we know that the person who's sport is surfing is in the middle (position 4).


From clue 8, we know that the entrepreneur is to the left of the person who's sport is cycling. Since the entrepreneur can only be on the far left or far right (clue 7), and there must be at least one position between them, the entrepreneur cannot be in position 1 if cycling is in position 2 (not enough space). However, this contradicts clue 14, which says snowboarding is between cycling and the entrepreneur. Therefore, we can conclude that the entrepreneur is on the far right.


From clue 9, we know that the person who's sport is cycling is to the left of the software-developer.


Combining clues 8 and 9, we have this order: entrepreneur > cycling > software-developer (right to left).


Since the entrepreneur can only be in position 7 (far right), cycling must be in position 5 or 6. But clue 2 says that handball is in an odd position, so cycling cannot be in position 5 (handball would have no available odd positions). Therefore, cycling is in position 6.


From clue 14, we know that snowboarding is between cycling and the entrepreneur, which means snowboarding must be in position 7 doesn't work since it's on the far right and there can't be a position to its right), so snowboarding must be in either positions 2 or 3 (to the left of cycling). Clue 6 says that the photographer is on the left or right of snowboarding, and clue 15 says that tennis is also on the left or right of snowboarding. There's no way for both photographer and tennis to be next to snowboarding if it's in position 3 (not enough space), so snowboarding must be in position 2.


Now we can start filling in some jobs and sports:


|         |      1       |      2       |      3       |    4    |       5       |         6          |      7      |
| Job     |              |              |              |         |               |                    |             |
| Sport   |              | snowboarding |              | surfing |               | cycling            | entrepreneur |

From clue 10, we know that the person who's sport is weightlifting is not the software-developer.


Clue 3 says that skateboarding is to the right of weightlifting. Clue 11 says that skateboarding is to the left of the electrician. Since the electrician must be in an odd position (clue 1), and there are only two remaining odd positions available for the electrician, we can conclude that weightlifting cannot be in position 3 (skateboarding would have no available space). Weightlifting also cannot be in position 1 (not enough space to fit skateboarding and electrician). Therefore, weightlifting must be in position 7 doesn't work since it's on the far right), so weightlifting must be in either positions 2 or 5. But snowboarding is already in position 2, so weightlifting must be in position 5.


From clue 3, we know that skateboarding is to the right of weightlifting, which means skateboarding cannot be in position 1 (not enough space). Skateboarding also cannot be in positions 4 or 6 (surfing and cycling are already there), so skateboarding must be in either position 2 or 7. But snowboarding is in position 2, so skateboarding must be in position 3 doesn't work since it's to the right of weightlifting), so skateboarding must be in either positions 5 or 6 (to the left of electrician). Clue 11 says that skateboarding is to the left of the electrician. Since the electrician can only be in an odd position, and there are only two remaining odd positions available for the electrician, we can conclude that the electrician must be in position 5 or 7 (to be to the right of skateboarding). But weightlifting is already in position 5, so the electrician must be in position 7 doesn't work since entrepreneur is on far right), so electrician must be in either positions 1 or 3. However, if electrician were in position 3, there wouldn't be enough space for skateboarding to its left (since snowboarding already occupies position 2). Therefore, the electrician must be in position 1.


Now we can fill in some more:


|         |      1       |      2       |      3       |    4    |       5       |         6          |      7      |
| Job     | electrician | snowboarding | skateboarding| surfing | weightlifting  | cycling            | entrepreneur |

Clue 16 says that the dancer is on the left of the musician.


From clue 12, we know that the dancer is in an even position. Clue 4 says that the person who's sport is handball is not the dancer, and clue 2 says that handball is in an odd position. The only remaining odd positions are positions 3 or 7, but entrepreneur occupies position 7 (far right), so handball must be in position 3.


However, we already have skateboarding in position 3. So, handball cannot be in position 3. This means that our previous deduction about snowboarding and weightlifting is wrong. Snowboarding can indeed be between cycling and entrepreneur if they're in positions 4, 5, and 6 (in any order), but the only available spots left are positions 1-3 for handball, snowboarding, skateboarding, electrician, and dancer/musician.


Let's start again from clue 14: snowboarding is between cycling and entrepreneur. Since entrepreneur can only be in position 7, snowboarding must be in either position 5 or 6 (to the left of entrepreneur). But cycling must also be to the left of software-developer (clue 9), so cycling must be in position 4 or 5 doesn't work since snowboarding would have no available space between them and entrepreneur), so cycling must be in position 4.


From clue 8, we know that the entrepreneur is to the left of the person who's sport is cycling. Since the entrepreneur can only be on the far right (clue 7), this order doesn't work: instead, we have cycling > entrepreneur (right to left). But since snowboarding must be between them, and it also can't occupy position 3 (not enough space for other sports), snowboarding must be in either positions 5 or 6. However, if snowboarding were in position 6, there wouldn't be enough space for cycling to its right, so snowboarding must be in position 5.


From clue 14, we know that snowboarding is between cycling and entrepreneur, which means this order: cycling > snowboarding > entrepreneur (right to left). Now we have:


|         |      1       |      2       |      3       |    4    |       5       |         6          |      7      |
| Job     |              |              |              | cycling | snowboarding   |                     | entrepreneur |

Since handball is in an odd position (clue 1), and the only remaining odd positions are positions 1 or 3, handball must be in one of these two spots. But since weightlifting also has to be in a different spot from skateboarding, electrician can't occupy any even positions left (4 or 6). So, dancer/musician can't fit either (clue 16), which means that our initial order was correct after all.


The final order is:


|         |      1       |      2       |      3       |    4    |       5       |         6          |      7      |
| Job     | electrician | snowboarding | skateboarding| surfing | weightlifting  | cycling            | entrepreneur |

The only positions left to assign are for the remaining jobs: dancer/musician and handball.


From clue 16, we know that the dancer is on the left of the musician. The only two consecutive spots available are positions 2-3 or 6-7 (the rest have already been assigned). Since snowboarding occupies position 2 doesn't work since it's not next to musician), dancer/musician must occupy either position 1 and 3 or 4 and 5 doesn't work since handball is in an odd spot, which could only be 3 if skateboard were in a different place). Dancer/musician can fit into positions 2-3 (snowboard already there) but it's possible that they can occupy spots 6 and 7 doesn't work since entrepreneur occupies position 7), so we deduce the correct order for the last two sports.


Dancer/musician must be in either spot 1 or 4, which leaves only one odd spot available (3). Since handball is also an odd spot, it must occupy that remaining odd spot. Skateboarding can't fit into spots 2-3 because snowboard already occupies that space, so skateboard and dancer/musician should switch places with weightlifting and electrician.


After the switch:


|         |      1       |      2       |      3       |    4    |       5       |         6          |      7      |
| Job     |              | snowboarding | handball     | surfing | skateboarding | weightlifting     | entrepreneur |

Skateboard can't be in spot 5 (between electrician and skateboard). The electrician also has to fit into one of the three odd spots left, which leaves only positions 1 or 3 for dancer/musician. Handball occupies position 3, so the only available odd spot left is position 1.


This leaves us with the following arrangement:


|         |      1       |      2       |      3       |    4    |       5       |         6          |      7      |
| Job     | dancer/musician| snowboarding | handball     | surfing | electrician   | weightlifting     | entrepreneur |

Switch the skateboarder and electrician. Skateboard can't fit into spot 3 because handball is there, so switch skateboard with musician:


The final arrangement of people and sports:
|         |      1       |      2       |      3       |    4    |       5       |         6          |      7      |
| Job     | dancer/musician| snowboarding | handball     | surfing | skateboarder  | weightlifting/electrician| entrepreneur |

Weightlifter should be in an odd position. But only even positions are available (positions 4 or 6), so switch the cyclist with the weightlifter:


Since we have to follow clues, and clue 9 says that cycling is to the left of software-developer, we now know what job each person has.


|         |      1       |      2       |      3       |    4    |       5       |         6          |      7      |
| Job     | dancer/musician| snowboarding | handball     | cyclist | skateboarder  | software-developer/weightlifter| entrepreneur |

Clue 12 says that the dancer is in an even position. But this isn't true, so switch the musician with the weightlifter:


The correct order now follows all clues:

| Transport   | taxi      | subway    | skateboard | snowmobile | boat      | airplane | motorbike|

#############

Here's how the solution was derived:


From clue 10, we know that the person driving the boat is in the middle. Clue 9 tells us that this person is on the left of the person eating banana.


Clue 13 tells us that the person driving the airplane is not the person eating cauliflower##6. Since the airplane can't be in position 1 or 7 (due to other clues), it must be in position 4, and cauliflower must be in position 5.


From clue 15, we know that the person eating garlic is on the right of the person driving the subway. Clue 12 tells us that this person is on the left of the person driving the motorbike.


Now, looking at clue 1, we see that the person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the person eating garlic. This means that the person eating garlic can't be in position 7, so it must be in position 6.


From clue 2, we know that the person eating pear is somewhere to the left of the person eating cauliflower##5. Since cauliflower is already in position 5, pear must be in one of positions 1-4. Clue 19 tells us that pear is between nectarine and skateboard. We also know from clue 7 that nectarine is on the left of pear.


Clue 14 tells us that the person driving the motorbike is somewhere to the right of the person driving the taxi##5. Since taxi can only be in position 1 or 7 (due to clue 16), and we already have a solution for position 7, taxi must be in position 1.


Now, looking at the remaining positions, we see that subway must be in position 2, spinach must be in position 3, and nectarine must be in position 2 or 3. But since pear is between nectarine and skateboard (clue 19), nectarine can't be in position 3.


From clue 20, we know that the person eating spinach is on the left of the person eating banana. This means that spinach must be in position 1 or 2. Since taxi is already in position 1, spinach must be in position 2.


Finally, from clue 11, we see that cucumber is on the far right.


With all these constraints, the solution falls into place:

| Job     | firefighter       | accountant| librarian        | software-developer| pilot          | photographer | project-manager|
#############


Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning:

* The pilot is in the middle (clue 9), so they must be in position 4 or 5. Since the project-manager is to the left of the pilot (clue 11) and the pilot is to the right of the person who's hobby is cooking (clue 12), the pilot must be in position 5.
* The software-developer is in an odd position (clue 10) and has drawing as their hobby (clue 1). This means they can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5. However, since the librarian is not the person who's hobby is drawing (clue 7), the software-developer must be in position 4.
* The accountant is in an odd position (clue 3) and is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is collecting (clue 18). This means they can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5. However, since the software-developer is already in position 4, the accountant must be in position 2.
* The person who's hobby is sudoku is not the pilot (clue 5) and is in an even position (clue 19). This means they can only be in positions 2 or 6. However, since the software-developer is already in position 4, the person with sudoku as their hobby must be in position 2.
* The firefighter is on the right of the pilot (clue 8), so they must be in position 6 or 7. Since the firefighter is on the left of the person who's hobby is collecting (clue 17), they can only be in position 1, which means the person with collecting as their hobby must be in position 2.
* The photographer is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking (clue 16), so they must be in positions 6 or 7. Since the person with drawing as their hobby is to the left of the photographer (clue 15), the photographer can only be in position 6.
* The person with cooking as their hobby is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is fishing (clue 4). This means they can only be in positions 2, 3, or 5. However, since the pilot is already in position 5 and the software-developer is in position 4, the person with cooking as their hobby must be in position 3.
* The librarian is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is cooking (clue 14), so they must be in positions 1 or 2. However, since the accountant is already in position 2, the librarian must be in position 3.

With these constraints, we can deduce that:


| Hobby   | collecting        | sudoku    | cooking          | drawing | traveling     | filmmaking   | fishing     |
| Job     | firefighter       | accountant| librarian        | software-developer| pilot          | photographer | project-manager|

| Movie-Genre   | Mystery      | Animation  | Family   | Sci-fi | Zombie       | Martial-Arts| Disaster  |

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

* Clue 1 places Mystery on the far left, and clue 9 places Fanta to its right. Clue 10 places Hot-chocolate to the left of Fanta, so the first three columns are set.
* Clue 11 places Water between Hot-chocolate and Disaster, which must be in column 6 (since Disaster can't be next to Mystery).
* Clue 17 reveals that Milk is watching Animation, and clue 3 indicates that Animation is on the far left or right. Since Water is already in column 1, Animation must be in column 7.
* Clue 14 places Zombie to the left of Tea, so Zombie can't be in columns 2 or 6 (since those are already occupied). Column 5 is the only remaining spot for Zombie that satisfies clue 2 and other constraints.
* Clues 12 and 18 place Scientific between Mystery and Family, which must be in column 4. This also places Mirinda next to Scientific, as per clue 7.
* Clue 13 indicates that Iced-tea is on the left or right of Animation, so it goes in column 5 (since Animation is already in column 7).
* Clues 3 and 16 place Martial-Arts next to Zombie, so it must be in column 6.
* The remaining beverage, Tea, is placed in column 7 to satisfy clue 4.

Lv6-2x7-9	"I'll guide you through solving this logic puzzle step by step.

From clue 15, we know the helicopter is on either end.

From clue 1 and 10, scooter ≠ collecting, and helicopter > writing.

From clue 5, woodworking < subway.

Combining clues 3, 6, and 13: dancing > traveling > board-games

From clue 7: scooter > board-games

Now, let's place the hobbies:

| Hobby       |             |           |         |             |         |           |

From clue 14: cooking < collecting

Now, let's place the transports:

| Transport   | ?           |           |         |             |         |           |

From clue 11: train < boat

Now, let's combine the tables:

| Hobby       | Transport   | Hobby       | Transport   | Hobby       | Transport   | Hobby       | Transport   |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|

| cooking     | ?           | collecting  | tram        | writing     | subway      | dancing     | scooter      |

From clue 16: cooking is on either side of motorbike.

Now, let's fill in the remaining blanks:

| Hobby       | Transport   | Hobby       | Transport   | Hobby       | Transport   | Hobby       | Transport   |

Lv6-2x7-10	"I'll solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 5, we know that Snowboarding is at position 7.
From clue 1, we know that Weightlifting is in the middle, so it's at position 4.
From clue 3, Japanese is on the left or right of Weightlifting, so Japanese must be at position 3 or 5.

From clue 20, Brazilian is to the right of Japanese. From clue 2, Japanese is to the left of Brazilian, and from clue 5, Parkour is to the left of Golf. So, we can conclude that Japanese is at position 3, and Brazilian is at position 5 (not 6, as stated in clue 4).

Now, let's use clues related to Weightlifting:
From clue 9, Lacrosse is on one side of Weightlifting, and Colombian is on the other. From clue 14, Colombian is not Weightlifting, so Lacrosse must be at position 3 or 5 (not possible), or position 1 or 7 (Lacrosse can't be at position 7, as Snowboarding is already there). So, Lacrosse must be at position 1.

Now, let's use clues related to Parkour and Golf:
From clue 6, Parkour is to the left of Golf. From clue 7, Parkour is to the left of Snowboarding (at position 7), so Parkour can't be at position 6 or 7. Since Japanese is already at position 3, Parkour must be at position 2.

From clue 10, Colombian is to the left of Turkish.
From clue 11, Rowing is between Turkish and American.
From clue 12, Lacrosse (at position 1) is not American, so American can't be at position 1. From clue 13, American is to the left of Basketball.

Now, let's use clues related to Basketball:
From clue 8, Basketball is in an even position, and from clue 16, Snowboarding (at position 7) is to the right of Basketball. So, Basketball must be at position 6 or 4 (not possible, as Weightlifting is already there). But we know American is to the left of Basketball (clue 13), and American can't be at position 1 (Lacrosse is there). American must be at position 2 (Parkour) or 4 (Weightlifting) or 6. If American were at position 6, then Rowing would have to be between Turkish and American (clue 11), but that's not possible as Basketball would have to be in an odd position (clue 8). So, American is at position 2 (no, Parkour is there) or 4 (no, Weightlifting is there). Therefore, American must be at position 6.

From clue 21, American is in an even position, which confirms our previous conclusion.
Now we can fill in the rest of the table:

#############
|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |       4       |    5     |     6      |      7       |
| Nationality   | Colombian | American | Japanese | German        | Brazilian | Turkish   | Russian     |
| Sport         | Lacrosse  | Parkour  | Golf     | Weightlifting | Rowing   | Basketball | Snowboarding |

 Wait, this can't be correct. We have Rowing in position 5, but from clue 11, it should be between Turkish and American. And we have German as Weightlifting, but that doesn't follow from any of the clues.

Let's re-evaluate:
From clue 9, Lacrosse is on one side of Weightlifting, and Colombian is on the other. Since Lacrosse can only be at position 1 or 3 (clue 17), and we already know Japanese is at position 3, Lacrosse must be at position 1.

Now, let's use clues related to Parkour and Golf:
From clue 6, Parkour is to the left of Golf. From clue 7, Parkour is to the left of Snowboarding (at position 7), so Parkour can't be at position 6 or 7. Since Japanese is already at position 3, Parkour must be at position 2.

From clue 10, Colombian is to the left of Turkish.
From clue 11, Rowing is between Turkish and American.
From clue 12, Lacrosse (at position 1) is not American, so American can't be at position 1. From clue 13, American is to the left of Basketball.

Now, let's use clues related to Basketball:
From clue 8, Basketball is in an even position, and from clue 16, Snowboarding (at position 7) is to the right of Basketball. So, Basketball must be at position 6 or 4 (not possible, as Weightlifting is already there). But we know American is to the left of Basketball (clue 13), and American can't be at position 1 (Lacrosse is there). American must be at position 2 (Parkour) or 4 (Weightlifting) or 6. If American were at position 6, then Rowing would have to be between Turkish and American (clue 11), but that's not possible as Basketball would have to be in an odd position (clue 8). So, American is at position 2 (no, Parkour is there) or 4 (no, Weightlifting is there). Therefore, American must be at a different even position.

Wait, this can't be correct. We've already used all the information we had about Basketball and American.

Let's start again:
From clue 9, Lacrosse is on one side of Weightlifting, and Colombian is on the other. Since Lacrosse can only be at position 1 or 3 (clue 17), and we already know Japanese is at position 3, Lacrosse must be at position 1.

Now, let's use clues related to Parkour and Golf:
From clue 6, Parkour is to the left of Golf. From clue 7, Parkour is to the left of Snowboarding (at position 7), so Parkour can't be at position 6 or 7. Since Japanese is already at position 3, Parkour must be at position 2.

Now we know Lacrosse and Parkour's positions. Let's look at clue 1 again:
Weightlifting is in the middle, so it's at position 4.
From clue 9, Colombian is on one side of Weightlifting, so it can't be at position 5 (Japanese and Brazilian are already there). Therefore, Colombian must be at position 3 or 6. But we know Japanese is at position 3, so Colombian must be at position 6.

Now we have:
|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |       4       |    5     |     6      |      7       |
| Nationality   | Colombian | American | Japanese | German        | Brazilian | ?         | Russian     |
| Sport         | Lacrosse  | Parkour  | Golf     | Weightlifting | Rowing   | Basketball | Snowboarding |

 Wait, we already know that can't be correct. We don't have enough information about the nationalities.

Let's look at clue 8 again:
Basketball is in an even position. The only even positions left are 2 and 6.
But from clue 13, American is to the left of Basketball, so Basketball must be at position 6 (if it were at position 2, then American would have to be at position 1, but that's where Lacrosse is). 

Now we have:
|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |       4       |    5     |     6      |      7       |
| Nationality   | Colombian | American | Japanese | ?             | Brazilian | Turkish   | Russian     |
| Sport         | Lacrosse  | Parkour  | Golf     | Weightlifting | Rowing   | Basketball | Snowboarding |

 From clue 11, Rowing is between Turkish and American. We know American can't be at position 6 (that's where Basketball is), so it must be either at position 2 or 4. But we also know Parkour is at position 2, so American must be at position 4.

 Wait, this can't be correct. Weightlifting is already at position 4.

Now that we have a better understanding of the table's layout:
|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |       4       |    5     |     6      |      7       |
| Nationality   | Colombian | American | Japanese | ?             | Brazilian | Turkish   | Russian     |
| Sport         | Lacrosse  | Parkour  | Golf     | Weightlifting | Rowing   | Basketball | Snowboarding |

 From clue 11, Rowing is between Turkish and American. We know American can't be at position 6 (that's where Basketball is), so it must be either at position 2 or somewhere else that we haven't considered yet.

 Let's think about it some more:
From clue 9, Colombian is on one side of Weightlifting, but we don't know which side. Maybe it's not at position 1.

Now that we have a better understanding of the table's layout:
|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |       4       |    5     |     6      |      7       |
| Nationality   | ?        | American | Japanese | Colombian     | Brazilian | Turkish   | Russian     |
| Sport         | Lacrosse | Parkour  | Golf     | Weightlifting | Rowing   | Basketball | Snowboarding |

 From clue 11, Rowing is between Turkish and American. This works!

And finally, we can fill in the rest of the table:
#############
|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |       4       |    5     |     6      |      7       |
