Lv6-4x2-1	"Let's start by analyzing the clues:


From clue 1, we know that the person eating mango is to the left of the person drinking soy-milk.


From clue 2, we know that the manager is not the person eating mango.


From clue 3, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is to the left of the person drinking soy-milk.


Now, let's try to fill in the table:


Since the person eating mango is to the left of the person drinking soy-milk (clue 1), and there are only two columns, mango must be in column 1. Similarly, since the person who's hobby is writing is to the left of the person drinking soy-milk (clue 3), writing must also be in column 1.


We can now fill in the table as follows:


|            |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage   | Sprite     | Soy-Milk    |
| Food       | Mango      | Broccoli    |
| Hobby      | Writing    | Board-Games |
| Job        | ?          | ?           |


Now, let's consider the remaining two jobs. From clue 2, we know that the manager is not the person eating mango (who is in column 1). Therefore, the manager must be in column 2.


We can now fill in the table as follows:


|            |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage   | Sprite     | Soy-Milk    |

Lv6-4x2-2	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person watching comedy movies is in an odd position, which means they are in column 1.
2. The person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the person drinking 7up, so the skier must be in column 1 and the person drinking 7up is in column 2.
3. The person driving the airplane is not the person drinking almond-milk.

From clue 2, we know that the person who's sport is skiing is in column 1, which means the movie genre for this person is comedy (from clue 1).

Now, let's fill in what we have so far:


|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      |             | 7up         |

| Transport     |             |             |

From clue 3, we know that the person driving the airplane is not the person drinking almond-milk. This means that the person in column 1 (who drinks ?) must drive the airplane.

We can now fill in the transport for column 1:


|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      |             | 7up         |

| Sport         | Skiing    |             |
| Transport     | Airplane  |             |

Since there are only two movie genres, the person in column 2 must watch time-travel movies.


|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      |             | 7up         |

| Sport         | Skiing    |             |
| Transport     | Airplane  |             |

From clue 2, we know that the person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the person drinking 7up. The only remaining sport is volleyball.

Lv6-4x2-3	"Based on the clues, here is the solved puzzle:


|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      |  soy-milk   |    7up     |
| Hobby         | woodworking | filmmaking |
| Movie-Genre   |   zombie    | scientific |
| Transport     |  airplane   | skateboard |

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 1, we know that the person watching zombie movies is on the far left, so ""zombie"" goes in column 1.

From clue 2, we know that the person who's hobby is woodworking is not the person drinking 7up. Since there are only two beverages and two hobbies, this means that the person with the hobby of filmmaking must be the one drinking 7up. Therefore, ""filmmaking"" goes in column 2.

From clue 3, we know that the person driving the airplane is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since the person with the hobby of filmmaking is in column 2, this means that the person driving the airplane must be in column 1. Therefore, ""airplane"" goes in column 1.

Now we can fill in the remaining blanks. The person in column 1 is watching zombie movies and using an airplane, so they must be drinking soy-milk (since the person in column 2 is drinking 7up). This leaves the person in column 2 to use a skateboard and watch scientific movies.

Since the Brazilian is a fan of punk (clue 3), and the person who likes tennis does not like punk (clue 2), we can start by filling in some information:

| Transport     |            |           |

From clue 1, the Brazilian is to the right of the person driving the roller. So, the person driving the roller must be in column 1:

Since there are only two means of transport, the person in column 2 must use an airplane:

| Transport     | Roller    | Airplane |

Now, we know the person who likes tennis does not like punk (clue 2). So, the person in column 1 must like tennis:

Lv6-4x2-5	"After analyzing the clues, I think I have found the solution:


|               |     1      |    2    |
| Hobby         | Gardening | Singing |
| Job           | Journalist | Dancer  |
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific | Fantasy |
| Pet           | Rabbit     | Cat     |

Let's break down how I arrived at this solution:

From clue #3, we know that the person who sings is next to the owner of the rabbit. Since there are only two rows, this means the singer and the rabbit owner must be in the same column.

Clue #5 tells us that the singer is to the right of the journalist. Therefore, the journalist must be in column 1, and the singer (with their adjacent rabbit owner) must be in column 2.

Now, let's consider clue #6. The person who watches fantasy movies doesn't own a rabbit. Since we've established that the rabbit owner is next to the singer, this means the fantasy movie fan cannot be the singer (column 2). Therefore, the fantasy movie fan must be in column 1.

With the journalist already occupying column 1, we can deduce that the scientific movie fan is actually the journalist. This leaves the dancer for column 2, as they are the only remaining job left.

Finally, clue #3 tells us that the singer is next to the rabbit owner. Given our previous deductions, this means the cat must be owned by the singer (column 2).

So, here is the final solution table:


|               |     1      |    2    |
| Hobby         | Gardening | Singing |

Here's my reasoning:

* From clue 3, the owner of the cat is to the right of the person eating asparagus. This means Asparagus must be in column 2.
* From clue 1, the person watching Romance movies is to the right of the person watching Horror movies. This means Horror movies must be in column 1 and Romance movies in column 2.
* From clue 2, the person who's sport is Sailing is not eating Asparagus. Since Asparagus is in column 2, this means Sailing must be paired with Tomato (column 1).
* The only pet left for column 1 is Pony, and the only sport left for column 2 is Golf.

From clue 2, we know that the person eating onion does not like puzzles.

From clue 3, we know that the fan of hip-hop music is somewhere to the left of the person watching epic movies.

Let's start by filling in the hobby column. Since the person who likes fishing is on the left of the person who likes pop music (clue 1), and there are only two hobbies, the person who likes puzzles must be on the right. Therefore:

|               |    1    |     2      |

Now, let's fill in the music column. Since the fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the left of the person watching epic movies (clue 3), and the person who likes pop music is on the right, the fan of hip-hop must be on the left:

|               |    1    |     2      |

Now, let's fill in the movie column. Since the fan of hip-hop is on the left, and the person watching epic movies must be to their right (clue 3), the person on the right must watch satire movies:

| Sport      | Tennis   | Soccer    |


Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 4, we know that the person drinking water is on the left of the person whose sport is soccer. Since there are only two sports, and soccer is not on the left, tennis must be on the left.

Clue 3 tells us that the person eating artichoke is to the left of the person drinking coffee. So, the artichoke eater is on the left, which means corn is on the right (clue 1).

Now we know the food preferences: Artichoke on the left and Corn on the right.

From clue 2, we can deduce that the board-games hobbyist is not eating artichoke. Since artichoke is on the left, the board-games hobbyist must be on the right, which means writing is on the left.

Finally, we know from clue 4 that soccer is on the right of water. So, soccer is paired with corn and coffee (from clues 1 and 3), while tennis is paired with artichoke and water.

From clue 2, we know that the person driving the scooter is to the left of the person eating pomegranate. Since the scooter is already on the left, the food column must be: lemon (left) and pomegranate (right).

From clue 1, we know that the person driving the train is not the project-manager. Since the train is on the right, the job column can only be: project-manager (left) and security-guard (right), which also means that the train driver is a security guard.
