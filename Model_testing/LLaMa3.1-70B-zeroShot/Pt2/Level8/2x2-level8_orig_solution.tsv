Lv8-2x2-1	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|             |    1    |    2     |
| Food        | Onion   | Orange  |
| Transport   | Scooter | Airplane|
#############

Here's how the clues led me to this solution:

* Clue 1: The person driving the airplane is on the right of the person driving the scooter. This means that the airplane must be in column 2, and the scooter must be in column 1.
* Clue 2: The person eating onion is not to the right of the person driving the scooter. Since the scooter is in column 1, the onion eater cannot be in column 2 (because that would put them to the right of the scooter). Therefore, the onion eater must be in column 1.

With these two clues, we can conclude that:

* Column 1: Scooter + Onion
* Column 2: Airplane + Orange

So, the final solution table is:


#############
|             |    1    |    2     |
| Food        | Onion   | Orange  |
| Transport   | Scooter | Airplane|

Lv8-2x2-2	"Based on the given conditions, we can deduce the following:

* Condition 1 implies that the person drinking soy-milk cannot be to the left of the person whose sport is cycling.
* Condition 2 implies that the person whose sport is cycling must be to the right of the person drinking soy-milk.

Combining these two conditions, we get that the person drinking soy-milk must be in column 1 and the person whose sport is cycling must be in column 2. 

The person in column 1 cannot have lacrosse as their sport because then the person with cycling would not be to the right of them. So the person in column 1 has lacrosse, which means the person in column 2 has cycling.

Also, since the person drinking soy-milk is in column 1 and the person drinking juice must be different from soy-milk, they must be in column 2.

The final solution table is:

#############
|            |    1     |    2    |
| Beverage   | Soy-milk | Juice  |
| Sport      | Lacrosse | Cycling|

Lv8-2x2-3	"Based on the clues:


From clue 2, we know that the person eating peach is to the left of the fan of R&B.


Since there are only two options for music-genre (Pop and R&B), the fan of R&B must be in column 2.


Now, from clue 1, we know that the person eating cabbage cannot be to the left of the fan of R&B. Therefore, the person eating cabbage must be to the right of the fan of R&B, but since there is no one to the right of the fan of R&B (they are in column 2), it means that the person eating cabbage must be in column 1.


So, we can fill in the table:


#############
|               |   1   |    2    |
| Food          | Cabbage | Peach  |
| Music-Genre   | Pop     | R&B    |

Lv8-2x2-4	"Based on the given clues:

1. The owner of the dog is not to the right of the person eating lime.
2. The person eating lime is on the right of the owner of the dog.

From clue 2, we can deduce that the person eating lime must be in column 2, and the owner of the dog must be in column 1.

So, the table looks like this:

|        |   1    |  2   |
| Food   | potato | lime |
| Pet    | dog    |      |

Now, since there are only two pets (dog and fish), and the owner of the dog is already in column 1, the pet in column 2 must be the fish.

Therefore, the final solution table is:

#############
|        |   1    |  2   |
| Food   | potato | lime |
| Pet    | dog    | fish |

Lv8-2x2-5	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|             |     1      |     2      |
| Sport       | Soccer    | Ice-Hockey|
| Transport   | Snowmobile| Helicopter |

The reasoning is as follows:

* From clue 2, we know that the person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the left of the person driving the snowmobile. This means that the person playing soccer must be in position 1.
* Since there are only two sports and two transports, the person in position 2 must play ice-hockey.
* From clue 1, we know that the person driving the helicopter is not to the left of the person driving the helicopter. This implies that the helicopter driver must be in position 2, since if they were in position 1, there would be no one to their right.
* Therefore, the snowmobile driver must be in position 1.

So, here is the final solution:


#############
|             |     1      |     2      |
| Sport       | Soccer    | Ice-Hockey|

Lv8-2x2-6	"Let's break down the clues:


1. The person who likes baseball is on the right of the person drinking fanta.
This means that Fanta must be in column 1.


2. The person who likes volleyball is not to the right of the person who likes baseball.
Since the person who likes baseball is already on the right (column 2), this means that Volleyball must be in column 1.

Given these constraints, we can fill out the table:


#############
|            |     1      |    2     |
| Beverage   | Fanta     | Soy-milk |

Lv8-2x2-7	"Based on the given clues, let's analyze the puzzle:


From clue 1: ""the person eating pomegranate is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening""

This means that the person eating pomegranate cannot be in column 1. Therefore, the person eating pomegranate must be in column 2.


Now, let's analyze the hobbies:


From clue 1 again: ""the person eating pomegranate is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening""

This implies that the person with the hobby of gardening must be in column 1.


Now, we can start filling in the table:


|         |     1     |      2      |
| Food    |           |             |
| Hobby   | Gardening | Chess       |

We know that the person eating pomegranate is in column 2. We also know that there are only two types of food: papaya and pomegranate.


Let's fill in the food for column 1:


|         |     1     |      2      |
| Food    | Papaya   |             |
| Hobby   | Gardening | Chess       |

Now, we can fill in the remaining cell:


|         |     1     |      2      |
| Food    | Papaya   | Pomegranate|
| Hobby   | Gardening | Chess       |

Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:

|         |     1     |      2      |

Lv8-2x2-8	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The librarian is not to the right of the person driving the scooter.
This means the librarian can be either to the left of the scooter or have a different mode of transportation.

2. The videographer is on the far left.
Since there are only two columns, this means the videographer must be in column 1.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|             |      1       |     2     |
| Job         |              |           |
| Transport   |              |           |

From clue 2, we know the videographer is in column 1. Let's start with that:


|             | Videographer |     ?     |
| Job         |              |           |
| Transport   |              |           |

Now, let's consider clue 1. If the librarian were to be in column 2, then they would be to the right of the person driving the scooter (if it's in column 1). But this is not allowed by clue 1. Therefore, the librarian must have a different mode of transportation than the scooter.

Let's try to fill in the transportations:


|             | Videographer |     ?     |
| Job         |              |           |
| Transport   | Helicopter?  | Scooter? |

If the videographer uses the helicopter (column 1), then the librarian can use a different mode of transportation, which would be the scooter. But this is not allowed by clue 1! So, we must swap them:


|             | Videographer |     ?     |
| Job         |              |           |
| Transport   | Scooter      | Helicopter|

Now, let's fill in the remaining job (librarian):


|             | Videographer | Librarian |
| Job         |              |           |
| Transport   | Scooter      | Helicopter|

This solution satisfies both clues!


#############
|             | Videographer | Librarian |
| Job         |              |           |

Lv8-2x2-9	"Based on the given clues:


1. The person watching zombie movies is not to the left of the Mexican.

This implies that either the person watching zombie movies is to the right of the Mexican or they are in the same column (since there's no indication of a third column), but since we're working with only two columns, it suggests the person watching zombie movies must be in the second column.


2. The American is somewhere to the left of the person watching zombie movies.

Given that the first clue implies the person watching zombie movies is likely in the second column (since they can't be directly to the left of the Mexican), this means the American must be in the first column.


Combining these clues:


- The American, being to the left of the person watching zombie movies, cannot watch zombie movies themselves. Thus, the American must prefer thriller movies.
  
Given that the person watching zombie movies is in the second column and not directly to the left of the Mexican (and since there's no other nationality mentioned for this slot), it implies that the Mexican watches zombie movies.

So, the solution table would look like this:


|               |    1     |    2    |
| Movie-Genre   | Thriller | Zombie |
| Nationality   | American | Mexican|

Since I need to put '#############' around the final solution table as per your request, here it is:


#############
|               |    1     |    2    |

Lv8-2x2-10	"Based on the given information:


1. The person who's sport is surfing is not to the left of the Pakistani.
This means that either:
   - Surfing is on the right side and Pakistani is also on the right (but this can't be true since there are only 2 spots and one would have to be left of the other).
   OR 
   - Tennis is on the left side, and Surfing is on the right side.

2. The Pakistani is on the far right.


This means that Pakistani must be paired with Surfing (since it's not possible for Surfing to be left of Pakistani if Pakistani is on the far right), and Argentine must be paired with Tennis.


The final solution table would look like this:


#############
|               |     1     |     2     |
| Nationality   | Argentine | Pakistani |
