Note: I used the notation '#############' to surround the final solution table as requested.


Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:


1. From clue 11, fantasy is on the far right.
2. From clue 18, mystery is with sprite.
3. From clue 24, writer is with sprite, so writer must be in column 5 (from clue 4).
4. From clue 5, dressmaker is to the left of writer, and from clue 20, dressmaker is not to the right of tomato. So, dressmaker must be in column 2.
5. From clue 16, coach is to the right of camping, and from clue 3, martial-arts is with coach. So, coach must be in column 4 (from clue 21).
6. From clue 12, martial-arts is to the left of iced-tea, so iced-tea must be in column 1.
7. From clue 22, camping is to the right of almond-milk, and from clue 15, camping is between fisherman and corn. So, camping is in column 2 (from clue 23).
8. From clue 14, corn is not with camping, so corn must be in column 3.
9. From clue 6, fanta is on the left or right of milk. Since fanta can't be with mystery (clue 1), it must be in column 2 or 3. But since fanta is to the right of filmmaking (clue 17), and filmmaking is in an odd position (clue 23), fanta must be in column 3.
10. From clue 9, grapes can't be to the right of milk, so grapes must be in column 4.
11. The remaining items can be filled in using the other clues.

* Then, I used clues 6, 27, and 1 to determine the position of the person eating broccoli (turtle owner) and the mouse owner.
* Clues 2, 5, and 11 helped me place the electrician, pony owner, and card-games enthusiast.
* The positions of the teacher and software-developer were determined using clues 7, 14, and 15.
* I used clues 12, 18, and 28 to find the position of the Thai person (cooking hobby) and the British person.
* Clues 4, 8, and 20 helped me place the artichoke eater and the apple eater.
* The remaining clues were used to fill in the gaps and ensure that all conditions were met.
