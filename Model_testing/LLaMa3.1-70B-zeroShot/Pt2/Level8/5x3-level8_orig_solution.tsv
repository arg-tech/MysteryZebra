Lv8-5x3-1	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |     1     |       2       |     3      |
| Beverage      | cola     | soy-milk    | sprite   |
| Job           | chef     | social-worker| scientist|
| Movie-Genre   | epic     | musical     | spy      |
| Nationality   | brazilian| polish      | mexican  |
| Sport         | surfing  | ice-hockey  | basketball|
#############

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 2, we know the person watching musical movies drinks soy-milk.

From clue 1, we know the person who's sport is ice-hockey is between the person drinking cola and the person watching musical movies (soy-milk). This means the order is: cola, ice-hockey, soy-milk.

From clue 5, we know the chef is on the left or right of the social-worker. Since the chef can't be to the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey (clue 9), the chef must be to the left of the social-worker.

From clue 4, we know the scientist is on the left of the person drinking sprite. This means the order is: ..., social-worker, scientist, sprite.

Combining these, we get: cola, chef, social-worker, soy-milk, ice-hockey, scientist, sprite.

Now, let's fill in the movie-genres:

From clue 6, we know the person watching epic movies is not to the left of the person drinking soy-milk. This means the person watching epic movies must be to the left of the person drinking cola (chef).

The person watching musical movies drinks soy-milk.

From clue 8, we know the person watching spy movies is the person who's sport is basketball.

So, the movie-genres are: epic, musical, spy.

Now, let's fill in the nationalities:

From clue 3, we know the mexican is somewhere to the right of the social-worker.

From clue 7, we know the brazilian is not to the left of the polish. This means the polish must be to the left of the brazilian.

From clue 10, we know the brazilian is on the left of the person who's sport is basketball (spy movies).

Combining these, we get: brazilian, polish, mexican.

Finally, let's fill in the sports:

We already knew the order was: cola, ice-hockey, soy-milk. The person drinking cola can't be to the left of the person who's sport is basketball (clue 11), so the person drinking cola must have surfing as their sport.

The person watching spy movies has basketball as their sport.

So, the sports are: surfing, ice-hockey, basketball.

And that's how we arrived at the final solution!"

Combining these clues, we can deduce that the person who's sport is ice-hockey must be on the left side (column 1), and the person drinking cola is next to them.


From clue 8, we know that the person drinking cola is not to the right of the malaysian. So the malaysian must be in column 1.

| Sport         | ice-hockey |               |      -polo |

From clue 6, we know that the fan of d&b is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is traveling.


From clue 5, we know that the person who's hobby is skydiving is not to the left of the person who's sport is soccer. So the person who's hobby is skydiving must be in column 3.

Now, let's fill in some more information:


|               |    1    |       2       |     3      |

From clue 7, we know that the fan of r&b is not to the right of the fan of hip-hop.


So the person who's music-genre is hip-hop must be in column 2 or 3.

Now, let's fill in some more information:


|               |    1    |       2       |     3      |

From clue 3, we know that the spanish is not to the right of the person drinking cola.


So the spanish must be in column 1 or 2.

But the nationality in column 1 and 2 are already occupied. So the spanish must be the nationality in column 3.


Now, let's fill in some more information:


|               |    1    |       2       |     3      |

The beverage in column 3 is water.

The sport in column 2 is soccer.

The sport in column 3 is water-polo.

| Transport     | helicopter     | roller      | subway       |

#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I derived the solution:

* From clue 2, we know the person driving the roller is on the right of the person who's hobby is board-games.
* From clue 3, we know the person driving the subway is on the right of the person driving the roller.
* Combining these two clues, we can deduce that the order for hobbies is: board-games, video-games (clue 4), and drawing (by elimination).
* Clue 7 indicates that the chinese is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since clue 5 states that the chinese is to the right of the person drinking iced-tea, we can place the chinese in position 3.
* Clue 6 states that the french is between the police-officer and the chinese. Given the placement of the chinese, we can deduce that the french must be in position 2.
* The british nationality remains to be placed, which can only fit in position 1 (clue 9).
* Finally, using clue 1, which states that the accountant is in an odd position, we can place the accountant in either position 1 or 3. However, since position 1 is already occupied by the british, the accountant must be in position 2 or 3. Clue 8 provides a constraint on the transport order, allowing us to place the accountant in position 2.
* The remaining job, librarian, can only fit in position 3.

Lv8-5x3-4	"Let's analyze the clues and fill in the table step by step.


From clue 8, we know the software-developer owns a rabbit.

From clue 11, we know the owner of the chinchilla is in the middle, so the chinchilla must be at position 2.

From clue 5, we know the person who's hobby is collecting is on the right of the accountant. Also from clue 1, the person who's hobby is collecting is not to the left of the owner of the dog. So, the dog cannot be at position 1 (otherwise, the collector would be to its left). Therefore, the dog must be at position 3.

Now we have:


|               |     1     |     2      |         3          |

| Pet           |           | chinchilla | dog                |

From clue 10, we know the person watching fantasy movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching western movies.

From clue 6, we know the person watching western movies is not to the left of the person who's hobby is collecting. Also from clue 5, we know the person who's hobby is collecting is on the right of the accountant. Therefore, the western movie fan must be at position 3 (because they can't be to the left of the collector, and the collector is already at a higher number than the accountant).

Now we have:


|               |     1     |     2      |         3          |

From clue 3, we know the person who's hobby is reading is somewhere to the right of the person watching mystery movies.

From clue 7, we know the person who's hobby is reading is not the person watching western movies. Therefore, the reader must be at position 1 (because they are to the right of the mystery movie fan, but can't be at position 3).

Now we have:


|               |     1     |     2      |         3          |

| Pet           |           | chinchilla | dog                |

From clue 4, we know the fan of funk is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla.

Now we have:

| Pet           | rabbit    | chinchilla | dog                |

From clue 9, we know the accountant is somewhere to the right of the fan of country.

Therefore, the accountant must be at position 3 (because they are already at a lower number than the collector).

Now we have:


|               |     1     |     2      |         3          |

| Pet           | rabbit    | chinchilla | dog                |

From clue 2, we know the architect is somewhere to the left of the person watching western movies.

Now we have:


|               |     1     |     2      |         3          |

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

* From clue 8, we know the person drinking water is on the far left.
* Clue 9 tells us that the person eating peach is not to the left of the person drinking water. Since the person eating peach must be in column 2 (clue 6), the person eating cabbage must be in column 1.
* Clue 7 tells us that the person eating peach is also watching crime movies, which means they are in column 2 (clue 1).
* From clue 5, we know the person drinking milk is on the left or right of the fan of d&b. Since the fan of country is already in column 1 (clues 2 and 11), the fan of d&b must be in column 3, which means the person drinking milk is also in column 3.
* Clue 10 tells us that the fan of country is not to the right of the German, so the German must be in column 2. Since the Turkish is on the right of the German (clue 3), the Turkish must be in column 3.

|               |       1        |     2      |      3       |

| Sport         | weightlifting | tennis     | sailing     |

# # #  End of Solution  # # #

Explanation:

From clue 1, the police-officer is not to the right of the dancer. This means that either the police-officer is to the left of the dancer or they are in columns 2 and 3.

From clue 12, the police-officer's hobby is sudoku.

From clue 11, the police-officer's sport is weightlifting.

From clue 7, the police-officer is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is sailing. Given that the police-officer is not to the right of the dancer (clue 1), and considering clue 12, we can place the police-officer in column 3 with a hobby of sudoku.

From clue 6, the indonesian is on the right of the brazilian. 

From clue 9, the dancer is on the right of the brazilian. This places the dancer in column 2 and the brazilian in column 1.

From clue 5, the person who's hobby is dancing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is singing. Given that the dancer (dancing hobby) is already placed in column 2, this means the singer must be in either column 1 or 3.

However, from clue 4, the person who's hobby is singing is on the left or right of the brazilian. This places the singer in column 2, but that position is taken by the dancer, so we adjust our previous placement for the singer: The singer must then be in either column 1 or not directly next to the dancer due to this conflicting clue. 

From clue 5 and given our initial adjustment was wrong, we should correct it: Since the singer cannot be directly next to the dancer (as they were already placed), we place the singer in column 2 is incorrect; thus singer must go either side of dancing which isn't true since they are on left or right. Since dancing hobby is with the dancer in column 2 and singer has to be on either left or right of brazillian so singer goes into column 1.

Clue 3 says that the nigerian is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is sailing, but we already know (from clue 7) that the police-officer is to the left of the sailor. So, the sailor must be in column 2 or 3. 

Considering clues 10 and 8, the videographer cannot be on the right due to 2; and given 8: The person who's sport is tennis is not to the left of the videographer thus sailing can't go into 1st coloumn so sailor goes in column 3.

Thus sailor has to go in column 3 so police-officer (who also does sudoku as hobby) can only go into column 3. Police officer must be a weightlifter due to clue 11, and the nigerian owns the goldfish and is on the right of sailing; thus he cannot be the sailor.

Since we know that the dancer goes in column 2 (clue 9), that the singer goes in column 1, and that the police-officer (sudoku hobby) must go in column 3, and given the remaining clues regarding sports, pets, and nationalities, this leaves us with only one configuration:

|               |       1        |     2      |      3       |
| Hobby         | singing       | dancing    | sudoku      |
| Job           | dancer        | videographer| police-officer|
| Nationality   | brazilian     | indonesian | nigerian    |
| Pet           | ferret        | bird       | goldfish    |
| Sport         | weightlifting | tennis     | sailing     |

Given the remaining information, and the process of elimination for pets: 
singing (column 1), dancing (column 2) , sudoku(column 3)
indonesian can't go on left side as he has to be right of brazilian hence column 2.
ferret(bird)(goldfish)

|               |       1        |     2      |      3       |
| Hobby         | singing       | dancing    | sudoku      |
| Job           | dancer        | videographer| police-officer|
| Nationality   | brazilian     | indonesian | nigerian    |
| Pet           | ferret        | bird       | goldfish    |
| Sport         | weightlifting | tennis     | sailing     |

Now we know that the person who does dancing (column 2) cannot have a ferret due to clue 3: The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the owner of the ferret. Hence, it leaves only bird for column 2.

Column 1 and Column 3 are decided by default now

Lv8-5x3-8	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############

|               |       1       |     2     |       3        |
| Food          | Cherry      | Pomegranate | Pineapple    |
| Job           | Photographer | Librarian   | Security-Guard|
| Music-Genre   | Metal        | Pop         | Salsa        |
| Sport         | Basketball   | Biathlon    | Weightlifting|
| Transport     | Quad-bike    | Bus         | Airplane     |

#############


Let me explain the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

From clue 3, we know the Librarian is in the middle.

Clue 2 tells us the fan of salsa is on the left or right of the librarian. Since the librarian is in the middle, salsa must be either person 1 or 3.

Clue 6 says the fan of salsa is to the right of the person driving the quad-bike. This means salsa must be person 3, and the quad-bike driver is person 1.

Clue 4 tells us that biathlon is between pomegranate and airplane. Since airplane can't be person 1 (quad-bike is), it must be either person 2 or 3. But if it were person 2, then biathlon would have to be person 3, which contradicts clue 6. So airplane is person 3.

Now we know the order of transport: quad-bike, bus, airplane (or vice versa for bus and airplane).

Clue 7 says the person driving the bus is on either side of pop. Since the librarian is in the middle, pop must be person 2 or 3. But if it were person 3, then pomegranate would have to be person 1, which contradicts clue 9 (pineapple is next to photographer). So pop is person 2.

From clue 10, we know pomegranate can't be right of pop, so pomegranate must be person 2 and pineapple is person 3.

The last piece of information is from clue 5: the fan of metal is not basketball. But since biathlon is between pomegranate (person 2) and airplane (person 3), it can't be person 1, so it must be person 2 or 3. And since person 3's sport is weightlifting, biathlon must be person 2.

Now we have the complete solution!

Lv8-5x3-9	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a possible solution:


|               |      1       |     2      |    3    |
| Beverage      |              |            |         |

| Transport     |              |            |         |

Here's the solution:


#############
|               |      1       |     2      |    3    |
| Beverage      | water        | tea        | iced-tea|
| Hobby         | magic-tricks | gardening  | fishing  |
| Movie-Genre   | drama        | family     | western  |
| Pet           | horse        | ferret     | chinchilla|
| Transport     | ship         | tram       | motorbike|
#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 12, we know that the person driving the ship is the one drinking water. This goes in position 1.
* Clue 9 tells us that the owner of the chinchilla is to the right of the person driving the ship (water), so the chinchilla must be in position 3.
* From clue 10 and 11, we know that the owner of the ferret is to the left of both the person drinking iced-tea and tea. This means the ferret must be in position 2.
* Clue 7 tells us that the person watching western movies is not the one drinking iced-tea, so western movies must be in position 3 (with chinchilla).
* From clue 5, we know that the person watching drama movies is in an even position. This means drama movies must be in either position 1 or 2. However, since water is already in position 1, and ferret is in position 2, drama movies must be in position 1 (with ship).
* Clue 8 tells us that the person driving the motorbike is to the left of the person watching western movies, so the motorbike must be in either position 1 or 2. However, since ship and tram are already taken, the motorbike must be in position 3.
* From clue 6, we know that the person driving the tram is on the far left or far right. Since ship is already on the far left, the tram must be on the far right, which means it's not in position 2 (with ferret). Therefore, gardening (from clue 3) and family movies must be in position 2.
* Clue 1 tells us that the person who's hobby is fishing is to the right of the person drinking iced-tea. This means fishing must be in position 3.
* Finally, magic-tricks is the only hobby left, so it goes in position 1.

Please note that this solution might not be unique, and there could be other possible arrangements satisfying all the clues."

| Transport     | Bike       | Boat       | Train   |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 7, the Polish person is on the far right.
* From clue 6, the person driving the bike is to the left of the train driver. Since the Polish person can't be driving the bike (clue 10), and the Brazilian is not to the right of the avocado eater (clue 4), the Nigerian must be in position 2.
* Clue 9 implies that the goat owner is to the right of the juice drinker, which means the guinea-pig owner is in position 1.
* The lemon eater is to the left of the strawberry eater (clue 5), so they occupy positions 2 and 3, respectively.
* Since the person eating strawberry is to the right of the rabbit owner (clue 1), and the rabbit owner isn't drinking juice (clue 2), the rabbit must be in position 3.
