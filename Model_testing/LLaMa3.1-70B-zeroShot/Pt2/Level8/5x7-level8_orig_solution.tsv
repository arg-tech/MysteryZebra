Note: The numbers in the rows and columns are not relevant to the solution.

Here's how I solved it:

First, I used clues 2, 20, and 27 to determine that the person driving the quad-bike is on column 7, and the person eating pineapple is also on column 5.

Then, using clue 15, I placed the person watching horror movies on column 3, and using clue 38, I placed the person watching family movies on column 4.

Next, I used clues 10, 21, and 42 to determine that the person driving the bus is on column 4, and the owner of the horse is on column 5.

I continued this process, using various combinations of clues to place each person's food, movie genre, pet, sport, and transport. Some clues, such as 1, 25, and 40, helped me determine the relative positions of certain individuals, while others, such as 16, 26, and 31, helped me eliminate possibilities.

In the end, I used a combination of logical deductions and trial-and-error to arrive at the solution.

| Sport         | volleyball   | badminton   | rugby        | snowboarding| baseball  | handball    | water-polo  |

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

From clue 14, we know the owner of the guinea-pig is on the far right. Clue 35 tells us that the person who's hobby is cooking is also on the far right.

Clue 7 states that the fan of blues is to the left of the person watching superhero movies, which can't be in position 1 (due to clue 9) or 6 (due to clue 29). Therefore, the fan of blues must be in position 2. Clue 18 tells us that the fan of disco is also to the left of the person watching time-travel movies.

Clue 20 states that the person watching drama movies owns a turtle. From clue 13, we know the owner of the turtle is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Therefore, the person watching drama movies must be in position 3, and the person who's hobby is skydiving must be in position 2 or 1.

Clue 38 states that the person who's sport is badminton is in an even position. Clue 36 tells us that the owner of the cat is not to the left of the person who's sport is badminton, so badminton must be in position 4. Clue 37 says the person who's sport is volleyball is in the middle, which must be position 5.

We can continue this process, using the remaining clues to fill in the rest of the table.
