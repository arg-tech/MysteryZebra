Lv8-1x3-1	"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who's sport is climbing is on the far right, so Climbing must be in column 3.

2. The person who's sport is climbing is not to the left of the person who's sport is sailing, which means Sailing cannot be to the right of Climbing (since Climbing is already at the far right). Therefore, Sailing must be either in column 1 or 2.

3. The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is sailing. Since Sailing can only be in columns 1 or 2, Weightlifting must be in column 1 (if Sailing is in column 2) or not possible if Sailing is already in column 1.

Considering all these constraints, we get:

#############

| Sport   |  Weightlifting |  Sailing | Climbing|

Lv8-1x3-2	"Based on the clues, we can deduce the following:


Clue 1 states that the person whose hobby is Sudoku is not to the left of the person whose hobby is Chess.


Clue 2 states that the person whose hobby is Sudoku is in the middle.


Combining these two clues, we can conclude that:


* The person with Sudoku as a hobby must be in position 2 (middle).
* Since Sudoku is not to the left of Chess, Chess cannot be in position 3. It must be in either position 1 or position 2 would be too close). But since Sudoku is already occupying position 2, Chess must be in position 1.


Now we have:


|         |   1   |   2    |     3     |
| Hobby   | Chess | Sudoku |           |

The only hobby left for the last person is Skydiving. So the final solution table is:

| Hobby   | Chess | Sudoku | Skydiving|

| Beverage   |          |       |     |

From condition 1, we know the person drinking soy-milk is to the left of the person drinking juice.


|            |    Soy-   | Juice |     |
| Beverage   |  milk     |       |     |

From condition 2, we know the person drinking juice is not to the right of the person drinking tea. Since juice is in position 2 and cannot be to the right of tea, tea must be either to the left or at the same position as juice. However, since soy-milk already occupies the first position, tea can only occupy the third position.


|            |    Soy-   | Juice | Tea |
| Beverage   |  milk     |       |     |

Therefore, the final solution table is:

Lv8-1x3-4	"Let's analyze the clues:


Clue 1: The person drinking cola is not to the left of the person drinking lemonade.
This means that either:
* Cola is to the right of Lemonade
* Or, they are in the same position (which can't be true since there are only 3 positions)


Clue 2: The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person drinking cola.
So, Cola must be to the left of Almond-Milk.


Combining both clues:
We know that Lemonade is not to the right of Cola (since Cola can't be to the left of Lemonade), so it must be in position 1. Then comes Cola in position 2, and finally Almond-Milk in position 3.

Here's the solution table:


#############

Lv8-1x3-5	"Let's analyze the clues:

Clue 1: The Colombian is in an even position.
This means the Colombian can only be in position 2.

Clue 2: The Colombian is not to the right of the Malaysian.
Since the Colombian is already determined to be in position 2, this clue implies that the Malaysian must be in either position 1 or 3. But if the Malaysian were in position 3, the Colombian would be to its left, which is allowed by the clue. Therefore, we can conclude that the Malaysian is likely in position 1.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |     1     |     2     |     3     |
| Nationality   | Malaysian | Colombian | Brazilian |

Lv8-1x3-6	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|         |      1      |    2    |    3    |
| Hobby   |  Reading  | Video-  | Writing |

The reasoning is as follows:

* Clue 1 states that the person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing. This means that Reading must be in position 1 or 2, and Writing must be in a position to its right.
* Clue 2 states that the person who's hobby is video-games is not to the right of the person who's hobby is reading. This means that Video-games cannot be in position 3 if Reading is in position 1 or 2.

Considering both clues, I placed Reading in position 1, Writing in position 3 (since it must be to the right of Reading), and Video-games in position 2 (which satisfies the condition that it's not to the right of Reading).

Lv8-1x3-7	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The fan of funk is not to the right of the fan of soul.
This means that if the fan of soul is in position 2, the fan of funk must be in position 1.

2. The fan of soul is in an even position.
Since there are only two even positions (2), this means the fan of soul must be in position 2.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |  1   |  2   |  3  |
| Music-Genre   |      |      |     |

From clue 1, we know that if the fan of soul is in position 2, the fan of funk must be in position 1. So, let's fill in:

|               |  1   |  2   |  3  |
| Music-Genre   | Funk | Soul |     |

The only music-genre left is pop, which must go in position 3.

Lv8-1x3-8	"Let's analyze the clues:

Clue 1: The fan of trance is on the left of the fan of techno.
This means Trance < Techno.

Clue 2: The fan of techno is not to the right of the fan of electronic.
This implies that Electronic and Techno are in a specific order, with Techno either before or immediately next to Electronic. 

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:

- Trance must be on the left (position 1).
- Techno cannot be on the far right if it's not to the right of electronic.
- Since Trance is already in position 1, and Techno has to be after Trance but also before or next to Electronic, then Electronic must be last.

Therefore, the order from left to right is: Trance, Techno, Electronic.

Here is the solution table:

#############
|               |   1    |   2    |     3      |
| Music-Genre   | Trance | Techno | Electronic |

Lv8-1x3-9	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person drinking milk is not to the left of the person drinking fanta.
This means that either milk is to the right of fanta, or they are in a different order (e.g., lemonade-fanta-milk).

2. The person drinking fanta is between the person drinking lemonade and the person drinking milk.

From this clue, we can deduce that the correct order must be: lemonade-fanta-milk.

So, let's fill in the table:

Lv8-1x3-10	"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who's sport is surfing is on the right of the person who's sport is water-polo.
This means the order is: ... Water-Polo -> Surfing ...

2. The person who's sport is water-polo is not to the left of the person who's sport is cycling.
This means that Cycling cannot be on the right of Water-Polo, because if it were, then Water-Polo would be to the left of Cycling.

Combining both clues, we can conclude:

* Water-Polo must be in position 1 (if it were in position 2 or 3, Surfing couldn't be to its right)
* Surfing must be in position 2
* Cycling must be in position 3 (because Water-Polo is not to the left of Cycling)
