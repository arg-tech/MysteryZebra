Lv8-7x4-3	"Here's the step-by-step solution:


From 9, the person eating cauliflower is in column 4.
From 11, the indonesian drinks soy-milk and from 1, they are to the left of milk, so they are in column 3. The person drinking milk is in column 4 but this contradicts with statement 9 that cauliflower is on the far right, therefore, the person drinking milk must be in column 2.
From 12, the person watching animation movies owns a pony and from 6, they are between house and argentine, but not necessarily directly. From 16, the canadian is to the right of onion which contradicts with statement 4 that the canadian is not to the right of cherry unless the canadian is in column 2 or 3, therefore, the person eating onion must be in column 1.
From 10, the person who's sport is skiing is to the right of onion and from 14, they are not to the left of the indonesian, so they must be in column 3 or 4 but because the person drinking soy-milk (the indonesian) drinks soy-milk and the person eating cauliflower eats cauliflower on the far right (column 4), therefore, skiing is in column 3. 
From 15, basketball is to the right of soy-milk, so they must be in column 4.
From 1, milk is to the right of the indonesian but this contradicts with statement 3 that the indonesian is to the left of basketball unless biathlon and skating are not in column 2 and therefore, the only sport left for column 2 is skateboarding isn't a possibility for column 2 because from 15 basketball must be in column 4 and from 10 skiing must be in column 3 which leaves no other option than that biathlon or skateboarding must be on the far left (column 1).
From 8, the canadian is to the left of animation and from 12 the person watching animation movies owns a pony. From statement 26, the canadian is next to french.
From 13, turtle isn't to the left of coffee so they must be in column 3 or 4 but this contradicts with statements 5 that the french are not to the right of the owner of the turtle and 8 that the french aren't to the right of coffee unless the french own a bird because if french is next to canadian then it has to be either on the left or right side of the table. Also, from statement 18, the turtle must be between onion and pony so this contradicts with previous deductions for the position of the turtle (column 3 or 4) unless biathlon isn't in column 1 because if it were then the only positions available would be either french or canadian owning a turtle which are both not possible. This would mean that french or canadian must own a bird because they can't own a turtle, and also this means that biathlon isn't an option for column 1 anymore.
From 24, cauliflower isn't to the right of r&b so they must be in column 3 but from statement 20 r&b is on either side of carrot which contradicts with our previous deductions unless the person eating carrot eats carrot in column 4 which can't happen because there's already cauliflower in column 4. This would mean that there's a swap between columns for the positions of the food - i.e onion and cherry switch places, as well as carrot and cauliflower.
From 19, bird isn't to the right of comedy so they must be in column 1 or 2 but from statement 21 comedy is on either side which contradicts with our previous deductions unless satire and comedy are at opposite ends (columns 1 and 4) and also because there's a swap between columns for onion and cherry as well as carrot and cauliflower, therefore the correct arrangement of foods will be: column 1 = cherry, column 2 = carrot, column 3 = onion, column 4 = cauliflower.
From 25, r&b is to the right of animation so they must be in column 3 or 4 but because there's a swap between columns for onion and cherry as well as carrot and cauliflower then this means that r&b will be in column 4 (since animation is in column 2), which contradicts with our previous deductions unless soul isn't to the left of pony which leaves only one other option: house.
From 5, comedy is on either side so they must be in columns 1 or 4 but because satire is also at opposite ends and we know that satire can only be in column 1 or 4, then this means that comedy will have to take the place of column 1 since satire can't occupy both ends (satire isn't at both column 1 and 4 at the same time), therefore comedy is in column 1.
From 2, satire is on either side so they must be in columns 1 or 4 but because comedy takes up column 1 then this means that satire will have to take the place of column 4 since satire can't occupy both ends (satire isn't at both column 1 and 4 at the same time), therefore satire is in column 4.
From statement 20 r&b is on either side of carrot which contradicts with our previous deductions unless metal is next to onion.
From 23, soul isn't to the left of pony so they must be in columns 2 or 3 but because there's a swap between columns for onion and cherry as well as carrot and cauliflower then this means that metal will take column 1 (since comedy takes up column 1 which we previously established), which contradicts with our previous deductions unless soul is next to french.
From statement 22 r&b is on either side so they must be in columns 1 or 4 but because there's a swap between columns for onion and cherry as well as carrot and cauliflower then this means that house will take column 2 (since animation takes up column 2 which we previously established) and also this leaves only one other option: soul is next to french.
From statement 8, the canadian is to the left of animation so they must be in columns 1 or 2 but because there's a swap between columns for onion and cherry as well as carrot and cauliflower then this means that the canadian will have to take column 2 (since animation takes up column 2 which we previously established), therefore french will take column 1 since they can't own a turtle.
From statement 18, turtle is between onion and pony so they must be in columns 2 or 3 but because there's a swap between columns for onion and cherry as well as carrot and cauliflower then this means that the turtle will have to take column 2 (since french takes up column 1 which we previously established) since it can't take any other place, therefore biathlon is next to the bird.
From statement 17, if biathlon isn't in column 1 then there's only one option for the position of the sport: skateboarding is in column 3 but this contradicts with our previous deductions unless the french or canadian own a turtle which we previously established as not possible. This means that there must be a swap between columns for french and canadian - i.e they switch places, therefore french will have to take column 2 since it can't take any other place, so biathlon is next to onion but this would mean that soul isn't next to french which contradicts with our previous deductions unless metal isn't in column 1. This means that there must be a swap between columns for the positions of metal and house - i.e they switch places.
From statement 20 r&b is on either side of carrot so they must be in column 3 but because house takes up column 2 which we previously established then this means that soul will take column 4 (since r&b takes up column 4 which we previously established), therefore metal isn't next to onion.
From statement 22, r&b is on either side so they must be in columns 1 or 4 but because there's a swap between columns for the positions of metal and house then this means that metal will take column 3 (since it can't take any other place), therefore coffee isn't next to carrot.
From statement 5, comedy is on either side so they must be in columns 1 or 4 but because satire takes up column 4 which we previously established then this means that comedy will have to take the place of column 1 since it can't take any other place (satire isn't at both column 1 and 4 at the same time), therefore coffee is next to cherry.



The final answer is:


# # #
 
| Column 1: Cherry, Metal, Coffee, Bird, Biathlon, Satire | Column 2: Carrot, House, Animation, French, Skateboarding, Comedy |
| Column 3: Onion, Soul, R&B, Canadian, Skiing, Turtle | Column 4: Cauliflower, Basketball, Milk, Pony, R&B |

From clue 26, we know that the person who has a sport of boxing drinks 7up.

Since the person watching epic movies has a hobby of chess (clue 18), and the person watching animation movies drinks 7up (clue 2), we can deduce:

|               |    1     |     2      |     3     |      4      |
| Beverage      |          | iced-tea   |           |             |
| Food          | kale     | cauliflower| papaya     | pepper     |
| Hobby         | traveling| skydiving  | chess      | gardening  |
| Movie-Genre   | animation | epic       | mystery    | thriller   |
| Nationality   | american | british    | russian   | colombian  |
| Sport         | cycling  |            | swimming   | boxing     |
| Transport     | bike      | helicopter | car        | quad-bike    |

The final table is:


| Column Name | american | british | russian | colombian |
|-------------|----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Beverage    | 7up      | iced-tea | lemonade| coffee    |
| Food        | kale     | cauliflower| papaya  | pepper    |
| Hobby       | traveling| skydiving | chess   | gardening |

So, the person who has a hobby of gardening is colombian."
