Here's the step-by-step reasoning to arrive at this solution:

From clue 5, we know that the person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography. This means the person with photography as a hobby cannot be in column 3.

From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is photography is not to the right of the person watching scientific movies. If the person with photography were in column 1, then the person watching scientific movies would have to be in column 1 or 2. But if they were in column 1, then clue 1 would be violated. Therefore, the person with photography must be in column 2.

From clue 5 again, we know that the person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography. Since photography is in column 2, water-polo must be in column 3.

From clue 4, we know that the person who's sport is soccer is between the person who's sport is water-polo and the person who's sport is golf. Since water-polo is in column 3, soccer must be in column 2 or 1, and golf must be on the other side of soccer.

From clue 2, we know that the person who's hobby is collecting is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since water-polo is in column 3, collecting must be in column 1 or 2.

From clue 3, we know that the person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is collecting. If collecting were in column 2, then western would have to be in column 1 or 3. But if it were in column 3, then scientific (which must be to the right of photography) would have to be in column 2, which would put scientific and photography together, violating clue 1. Therefore, collecting must be in column 3 is not possible because water-polo is already there, so collecting must be in column 1.

From clue 3 again, we know that western movies are on the left or right of collecting. Since collecting is in column 1, western must also be in column 1.

Now that collecting and western are in column 1, photography (column 2) cannot have a hobby of camping (because then collecting would not be to its left), so camping must be in column 3 is not possible because water-polo is already there. Therefore, the person with camping as a hobby must be in column 1.

But wait! Collecting and western are already in column 1, so this means that camping cannot exist! We made an incorrect assumption earlier. Let's re-evaluate.

Actually, we can place camping in column 3 is not possible because water-polo is already there. So let's try placing it in column 2. But photography is already in column 2, so that won't work either!

What if... what if collecting were in column 2? We know western must be on the left or right of collecting (clue 3), so western can go in column 1.

Now we have: 
- Western movies in column 1
- Collecting hobby in column 2

From clue 5, we know that water-polo is to the right of photography. Photography must be in column 1 or 2 (because if it were in column 3, then scientific would have to be to its right, but there's no room). We already have western and collecting taking up those spots. But wait! If photography is not in column 3, that means camping can be!

So now we know:
- Western movies in column 1
- Collecting hobby in column 2
- Camping hobby in column 3

From clue 4, we know soccer is between water-polo and golf. Water-polo must be in column 3 (because photography cannot be to its right). If soccer were in column 1, then golf would have to be in column 2, which can't happen because collecting is there. So soccer must be in column 2.

Now we know:
- Western movies and golf in column 1
- Collecting hobby and soccer sport in column 2
- Camping hobby and water-polo sport in column 3

But what about photography? It cannot be to the right of scientific, so scientific must go in column 2. The only spot left is column 1.

And finally! Fantasy movies can go in column 3!

From statement 4, we know the photographer is on the left of the lawyer.
From statement 6, we know the person who's sport is tennis is in the middle.
From statement 7, we know the person eating orange is in the middle.

So, we can start with this:


|         |      1       |   2    |     3      |
| Food    |              | Orange |            |
| Job     | Photographer |        | Lawyer     |
| Sport   |              | Tennis |            |

From statement 1, we know the person who's sport is tennis is not to the right of the person who's sport is basketball. Since tennis is in the middle, basketball must be on the left.


|         |      1       |   2    |     3      |
| Food    |              | Orange |            |
| Job     | Photographer |        | Lawyer     |
| Sport   | Basketball   | Tennis |            |

From statement 5, we know the freelancer is on the left or right of the person eating orange. Since the photographer is already on the left of the lawyer, and the middle column has orange, the freelancer must be on the right.


|         |      1       |   2    |     3      |
| Food    |              | Orange |            |
| Job     | Photographer |        | Lawyer     |
| Sport   | Basketball   | Tennis | Freelancer|

No, wait! The sport column should not have ""Freelancer"". It's the job that is freelancer.


From statement 2, we know the person eating orange is on the left or right of the photographer. This is already satisfied.

From statement 3, we know the person eating carrot is not to the right of the photographer. So, the person eating carrot must be on the left.


|         |      1       |   2    |     3      |
| Food    | Carrot      | Orange |            |
| Job     | Photographer |        | Lawyer     |
| Sport   | Basketball   | Tennis | Freelancer|

From statement 5, we know the freelancer is on the left or right of the person eating orange. Since the middle column has orange, and the job on the right is lawyer, the job in the middle must be freelancer.


|         |      1       |   2    |     3      |
| Food    | Carrot      | Orange |            |

Lv8-3x3-3	"After solving the puzzle, I arrived at the following solution:


|               |     1     |       2       |      3      |
| Beverage      | Cola    |  Iced-Tea   |  Mirinda  |
| Job           | Firefighter| Social-worker| Bartender|
| Nationality   | Colombian | Malaysian | French    |

Here's how the solution was arrived at:

From clue 5, we know that Mirinda is on the far right. 

From clue 4, we can deduce that the firefighter and social-worker are not in position 3 (since one of them must be to the left or right of the other). This means they must occupy positions 1 and 2.

Clue 7 tells us that the Malaysian is between the Firefighter and the French. Since the firefighter must be on the left, the order must be: Firefighter - Malaysian - French.

Now we have:


|               |     1     |       2       |      3      |
| Beverage      |          |               | Mirinda    |
| Job           | Firefighter| Social-worker| Bartender|
| Nationality   | Colombian | Malaysian | French    |

From clue 8, we know that the person drinking Cola is not to the left of the French. This means that Cola must be in position 1.

Clue 6 tells us that Iced-Tea is not to the right of the French. This means that Iced-Tea must be in position 2.


|               |     1     |       2       |      3      |
| Beverage      | Cola    |  Iced-Tea   | Mirinda    |
| Job           | Firefighter| Social-worker| Bartender|

The solution satisfies all the given clues.

Lv8-3x3-4	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step.


From clue 6, we know that the person driving the ship is also watching musical movies. So, we can start by filling in the Movie-Genre column for the Ship row:


|               |   1    |    2    |      3       |
| Movie-Genre   |        |         | Musical      |

| Transport     |        |         | Ship          |

From clue 2, we know that the fan of d&b is to the left of the person driving the ship. Since the ship is in column 3, the fan of d&b must be in either column 1 or 2.


|               |   1    |    2    |      3       |
| Movie-Genre   |        |         | Musical      |

| Transport     |        |         | Ship          |

From clue 5, we know that the fan of blues is in an even position. This means they must be in either column 2 or none at all (since there are only three columns). However, from clue 4, we also know that the fan of blues is to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.


|               |   1    |    2    |      3       |

| Transport     |        |         | Ship          |

From clue 1, we know that the person driving the ship is not to the left of the person watching musical movies. However, this doesn't add any new information since we already placed the ship and musical movie in column 3.


From clue 3, we know that the person driving the subway is not to the right of the person watching musical movies. This means the subway must be in either column 1 or 2.


|               |   1    |    2    |      3       |

| Transport     | Subway  |         | Ship          |

The only remaining movie-genre is Epic, which must go in column 1.

The only remaining music-genre is Folk, which must go in column 3.

Lv8-3x3-5	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:

| Nationality   | Spanish     | Indian  | Pakistani |
| Pet           | Chinchilla  | Cat     | Dog        |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 6, the owner of the chinchilla is on the far left or far right. Since the indian is to the left of the owner of the chinchilla (clue 1), the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 1.

Clue 4 states that the person who's hobby is photography is somewhere to the left of the indian, so photography must be in position 1, which corresponds with the owner of the chinchilla.

From clue 5, the owner of the cat is between the person who's hobby is fishing and the owner of the dog. Since the pakistani is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing (clue 2), and writing must be in position 3, the cat cannot be to the right of fishing (clue 3). Therefore, fishing must be in position 2, with the cat between it and the dog.

The remaining nationality, pakistani, goes to position 3."

| Nationality   | Canadian | Mexican | Australian|
| Sport         | Volleyball | Climbing | Swimming |
| Transport     | Ship       | Car     | Bike     |

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

From clue 2, we know the person driving the car is to the right of the person driving the ship. So, the order for transport is: Ship, Car, (and Bike, but we don't know its position yet).

From clue 1, we know the Mexican is between the person driving the car and the person driving the ship. This means the Mexican cannot be in column 1 or column 3, so they must be in column 2.

Since the Mexican is in column 2, the person driving the ship must be in column 1, and the person driving the car must be in column 3 (but we already knew that from clue 2).

From clue 4, we know the person who's sport is climbing is not to the right of the person who's sport is swimming. This means the climber must be either in column 1 or column 2.

Now, let's look at clue 3. The person who's sport is swimming is on the right of the Canadian. If the Canadian were in column 1, then the swimmer would have to be in column 2 or column 3. But we already know that the Mexican (who can't be the swimmer) is in column 2, and we don't want the swimmer to be to the right of the climber. So, the Canadian must be in column 1.

Since the Canadian is in column 1, the swimmer must be in column 3. And since the climber can't be to the right of the swimmer, the climber must be in column 2 (which we already knew).

The only sport left for the Canadian is volleyball. So, the final solution table is:

#              |    1     |    2     |     3      |
| Nationality   | Canadian | Mexican | Australian|
| Sport         | Volleyball | Climbing | Swimming |
| Transport     | Ship       | Car     | Bike     |

Note: I assumed that the ""between"" in clue 1 means that the Mexican is not driving either the car or the ship, and similarly for the other clues. If this assumption is incorrect, please let me know!"

Lv8-3x3-8	"Let's start by analyzing the clues:

From clue 2, we know that the Chinese person is to the left of the person who has camping as a hobby.

From clue 1, we know that the Dutch person is to the left of the person who has camping as a hobby. Since the Chinese person is already to the left of the camper, the Dutch person must be to the left of the Chinese person.

So far, we have:

From clue 5, we know that the owner of the lizard is between the owner of the pony and the person who has woodworking as a hobby.

Since the camper is to the right of the owner of the lizard (clue 4), and the camper is also to the right of the Chinese person (clue 2), we can conclude that the owner of the lizard is in position 2, and the person who has woodworking as a hobby is in position 3.

From clue 5, we also know that the owner of the pony is to one side of the owner of the lizard. Since the Dutch person is already in position 1, the owner of the pony must be in position 3.

However, this would mean that the person who has woodworking as a hobby is not in position 3, which contradicts our previous conclusion. Therefore, we must conclude that the owner of the pony is actually in position 1.

| Pet           | Pony        | Lizard    |           |

From clue 4, we know that the camper is to the right of the owner of the lizard. Therefore, the person who has camping as a hobby must be in position 3.

However, this would mean that there are two people with hobbies in position 3, which is not possible. Therefore, we must conclude that the person who has camping as a hobby is actually in position 2.

Lv8-3x3-9	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 2, we know the person who's hobby is traveling is the musician.

From clue 4, we know the musician is on the left of the police-officer. Since there are only three columns, the musician must be in column 1 or 2. But if they were in column 2, the police-officer would have to be in column 3, which would leave no space for the bartender (from clue 5). Therefore, the musician is in column 1.

From clue 5, we know the bartender is on the left of the person eating plum. This means the bartender can't be in column 3 (because then there would be no one to their right eating plum), and they also can't be in column 2 (because then the musician would have to be to their right). Therefore, the bartender is in column 1, which means the person eating cabbage must be in column 2 (from clue 1).

The only remaining job is the police-officer, who must be in column 3. The only remaining hobby is sudoku, which can't go with the musician (traveling) or the bartender (no time for hobbies!), so it must go with the police-officer.

Now we just need to fill in the foods:

From clue 3, the bartender is not to the right of the person eating spinach. This means the person eating spinach must be in column 2 or 3. But if they were in column 2, then the person eating cabbage would have to be in column 1 (which we already determined was occupied by the bartender), so the person eating spinach is in column 3.

That leaves plum for column 2.

Here's the final solution:

Lv8-3x3-10	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|             |       1       |      2      |   3    |
| Beverage    | hot-chocolate | almond-milk | sprite |
| Food        | cauliflower   | papaya      | radish |
| Transport   | car           | scooter     | ship   |


Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


From clue 6, we know that radish is on the far right.


Clue 4 tells us that papaya is next to ship. Since radish is already on the rightmost column, papaya must be in the middle column.


Now, using clue 3, almond-milk is somewhere to the right of cauliflower. Cauliflower cannot be on the rightmost column (occupied by radish), so it must be on the leftmost column.


Clue 2 states that scooter is not to the right of car. Given the current arrangement, scooter can only fit in the middle column, and car must be on the leftmost column.


Using clue 5, almond-milk is to the left of sprite. This means that almond-milk must be in the middle column (next to papaya), and sprite takes the rightmost beverage slot.


Finally, hot-chocolate takes the remaining beverage slot on the left.


With all these deductions, we can fill in the table with confidence!"
