Lv8-4x7-2	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a solution to the puzzle:


|               |    1     |     2     |      3       |     4      |     5     |     6     |     7      |

| Transport     | Motorbike| Helicopter| Airplane       | Taxi        | Bus         | Car        | Snowmobile |

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* From clue 15, we know the person driving the snowmobile is on the far right. Clue 5 also tells us that the bartender is somewhere to the left of the scientist.
* Clues 3 and 34 tell us that the coach drives a car and the taxi driver is to the left of the car driver.
* From clue 7, we know the bus driver is to the right of the airplane driver. Since the bus driver is in an even position (clue 26), they must be in either position 4 or 6. However, since the person eating plum is not to the right of the bus driver (clue 27), and the person eating artichoke is between the banana eater and the family movie fan (clue 23), we can deduce that the bus driver is in position 4.
* Clue 28 tells us that the person eating corn is driving a taxi. From clue 8, we know the manager is to the right of the corn eater. Since the bus driver is already in position 4, the manager must be in position 5.
* We can then use clues 13 and 25 to determine the order of movie genres: Adventure-Romance-Family-Mystery-Horror.
* Clues 16 and 18 help us place the orange eater between the bartender and the bus driver. The musician is either to the left or right of the lawyer (clue 31).
* Finally, we can use clues 22 and 32 to determine the positions of the remaining people.

#############

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 2, we know that the person drinking water is not to the left of the person eating carrot.
From clue 5, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the right of the owner of the goldfish.
From clue 13, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is between the australian and the person drinking iced-tea.

These three clues can be combined to deduce that:

* Water is not in column 1 (since it's not to the left of carrot)
* Soy-milk is to the right of goldfish
* Almond-milk is between australian and iced-tea

Using these constraints, we can start building the table.

2. From clue 3, we know that the person eating apricot is on the far right.
From clue 9, we know that the person eating apricot is on the left or right of the owner of the dog.

This means that the dog must be in column 6 (since apricot is in column 7).

3. From clue 8, we know that the person drinking fanta is in an odd position.
From clue 15, we know that the person drinking fanta is not to the right of the egyptian.

This means that fanta must be in column 5 or 1 (since it's an odd position and not to the right of egyptian).

4. From clue 14, we know that the person eating apple is somewhere to the left of the person eating mango.
From clue 16, we know that the owner of the ferret is on the left or right of the person eating apple.

This means that apple must be in column 3 (since it's to the left of mango and ferret is nearby).

5. From clue 20, we know that the person drinking cola is not to the left of the person drinking tea.
From clue 30, we know that the person drinking cola is somewhere between the person drinking soy-milk and the canadian.

This means that cola must be in column 4 (since it's between soy-milk and canadian).

6. From clue 27, we know that the owner of the ferret is on the right of the owner of the rabbit.
From clue 36, we know that the owner of the ferret is somewhere between the russian and the person drinking cola.

This means that ferret must be in column 4 (since it's between russian and cola).

7. From clue 10, we know that the person eating apple is not to the right of the owner of the mouse.
From clue 24, we know that the owner of the mouse is in an even position.

This means that mouse must be in column 2 or 6 (since it's an even position and not to the left of apple).

8. From clue 33, we know that the person drinking tea is between the thai and the person drinking almond-milk.
From clue 11, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is between the person eating potato and the person drinking iced-tea.

This means that tea must be in column 1 (since it's between thai and almond-milk).

9. From clue 26, we know that the person eating cabbage is somewhere to the left of the owner of the cat.
From clue 19, we know that the german is not the person eating cabbage.

This means that cabbage must be in column 2 (since it's to the left of cat and not eaten by german).

10. From clue 28, we know that the person eating cabbage is on the left or right of the person drinking tea.
From clue 32, we know that the person drinking cola is in an even position.

This means that cabbage must be in column 2 (since it's next to tea and not eaten by german).

The rest of the puzzle can be solved using similar deductions."

| Transport   | airplane    | jet-ski       | scooter        | helicopter   | motorbike  | ship         | snowmobile|


The explanation of the solution is quite long, but I'll give you a brief overview:

From clues 1 and 7, we know that Handball is not to the right of Cricket.
From clue 23, Tea is to the left of Hot-chocolate, which means Tea is in an odd position (clue 11). 
The nurse can't be on the far right because she needs to be to the right of the person driving the scooter (clue 13).
Clues 20 and 25 help us place Coffee and Videographer.
With clues 10, 14, and 24, we know that the pilot is between Motorbike and Bartender. 
Then clue 32 tells us Hot-chocolate can't be in an even position which narrows down its possible positions to only one (3 or 5). However, from clue 26, Weightlifting must be between Snowboarding and Hot-chocolate.
With clues 15, 22, and 38, we find that Cricket is next to Tea.
From here on out it's a combination of using the remaining information about Sport, Transport, Beverage and Job preferences.
