Lv8-1x2-1	"Based on the clues, I will fill in the table as follows:


|               |  1   |  2  |
| Music-Genre   |      |     |


From clue 1: ""the fan of d&b is on the right of the fan of funk"", we can conclude that:

* the fan of funk is on position 1
* the fan of d&b is on position 2

The table now looks like this:


|               |  1   |  2  |
| Music-Genre   | funk | d&b |

This solution satisfies both clues. Here is the final answer:


#############
|               |  1   |  2  |
| Music-Genre   | funk | d&b |

Lv8-1x2-2	"Let's break down the clues:

* The person watching musical movies is on the far right (Column 2).
* The person watching musical movies is not to the left of the person watching satire movies, which means the person watching satire movies must be either in Column 1 or also in Column 2.

Given that there are only two columns and the person watching musical movies is already assigned to Column 2, it's clear that the person watching satire movies must be in Column 1. The musical movies watcher can't be on the left of the satire movies watcher (as per clue 2), so they must occupy the rightmost spot.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv8-1x2-3	"A logic puzzle!


Let's analyze the clues:


1. The owner of the goldfish is somewhere to the left of the owner of the hedgehog.
This means that the goldfish owner cannot be in position 2.

2. The owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish.
This means that both owners must be next to each other, either in positions 1-2 or not at all (since there are only two positions).

3. The owner of the goldfish is not to the right of the owner of the hedgehog.
This clue seems redundant with clue 1, but it reinforces the idea that the goldfish owner must be to the left.

Considering all clues, we can conclude that:


The goldfish owner must be in position 1, and the hedgehog owner must be in position 2.


Here is the final solution table:


|       |    1     |    2     |
| Pet   | Goldfish | Hedgehog |

The person driving the scooter is not to the right of the person driving the scooter (this clue doesn't make sense, I assume it's a typo and you meant to say ""the person driving the train is not to the left of the person driving the scooter"")


The person driving the train is on the right of the person driving the scooter


Here is the solution:

Lv8-1x2-5	"Based on the given clues, I'll solve the puzzle.


Clue 1: The person who's hobby is video-games is not to the right of the person who's hobby is hiking.
This implies that either:
- Video-games is on the left and Hiking is on the right
or 
- Both hobbies are in the same column (left or right), but this is impossible since there are two different people with different hobbies.


Clue 2: The person who's hobby is hiking is on the far right.
This means that the correct arrangement must have Hiking on the far right, which corresponds to column 2.


Combining both clues, we can conclude that:


|         |      1      |   2    |
| Hobby   | Video-games | Hiking |


So the final solution is:


#############
 
|         |      1      |   2    |
| Hobby   | Video-games | Hiking |

Lv8-1x2-6	"Let's analyze the clues:


Clue 1: ""the owner of the goldfish is in an odd position""

This means that the goldfish must be in position 1, since it's the only odd-numbered position.


Clue 2: ""the owner of the rat is not to the left of the owner of the rat""

Since there are only two positions, this clue implies that the rat cannot be in position 1 (because then it would be to the left of itself). Therefore, the rat must be in position 2.


So, combining both clues, we get:


|       |    1     |  2  |
| Pet   | goldfish | rat |

 

Here is the solution table with '#############' around it:


#############

Since the person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the right of the person driving the train (Clue 1), and the person driving the train is not to the right of the person driving the jet-ski (Clue 2), it means that the person driving the train must be in position 1, and the person driving the jet-ski must be in position 2.

Here's the solution table:

Lv8-1x2-8	"A classic logic puzzle!

Let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who's hobby is chess is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
2. The person who's hobby is chess is not to the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.

These two clues are essentially saying the same thing: the chess enthusiast is to the left of the magic-trickster.

Since there are only two people and two hobbies, we can conclude that:

* Person 1 has a hobby of Chess
* Person 2 has a hobby of Magic-Tricks

Here is the final solution table:

| Food   |      |           |

The only possible arrangement that satisfies both conditions is:


Asparagus must be to the right of Plum (condition 1)


Since Asparagus can't be to the left of itself, it means there's no second Asparagus. Therefore, the correct placement is:


Plum on position 1 and Asparagus on position 2


Here's the final solution table:
