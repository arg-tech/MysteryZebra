Lv8-6x3-1	"After analyzing the given clues, I have come up with a possible solution for the puzzle:


|               |     1     |    2     |     3     |
| Food          |cranberry  |cucumber   |orange      |
| Job           |fisherman  |nurse      |lawyer      |
| Movie-Genre   |spy         |crime      |satire      |
| Music-Genre   |reggae      |disco      |trance      |
| Nationality   |pakistani   |german     |polish      |
| Transport     |trike       |airplane   |train       |

 

 Let me walk you through the steps:


From clue 11, we know that the person driving the trike is on the far left. Clue 13 tells us that the fan of trance is between the person watching spy movies and the person eating cranberry.


Clue 4 says that the polish person watches crime movies, so from clue 7, we can deduce that the fan of disco is to the right of polish, which means polish cannot be on column 3. Therefore, polish must be in column 2 or 3. Since lawyer (from clue 9) and german (from clue 6) are already going to be placed, polish has to go in column 2.


From clue 1, we know the lawyer is somewhere to the right of the fisherman. Also from clue 5, pakistani is somewhere to the right of airplane driver, so this would mean that pakistani can't be on column 1 or 2 because then there wouldn't be a person to their left who drives an airplane.


From clues 8 and 3, we know cucumber has to go in column 2. The lawyer cannot be watching crime movies (since the polish is), so either spy movies (with clue 13) or satire movies would work for the lawyer. But since the fan of trance can't be on the far right (clue 12), then it must mean the person eating orange goes in column 3 and watches satire.


From clues 6, 9, and 10 we know german has to go with either the train or airplane driver. Since airplane cannot be in column 2 because pakistani needs someone driving an airplane on their left (5), this means airplane must go in column 1 and therefore trike is not the airplane which makes sense given clue 11.


We also can deduce that german has to drive a train from clue 6, since if they drove an airplane it would conflict with clue 9. Now we have our final solution:


|               |     1     |    2     |     3     |
| Food          |cranberry  |cucumber   |orange      |

#############


This solution satisfies all the given clues. Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* Clues 1 and 10 helped establish that the person who likes metal is to the right of the owner of the bird.
* Clue 3 revealed that the person with filmmaking as their hobby also likes metal, so they must be on the far right.
* Clue 2 fixed the Egyptian's sport as sailing, which then led to the Italian being on either side of the dancer (clue 5).
* Clues 6 and 7 helped determine the order of jobs and sports for columns 1-3.
* Clues 8 and 9 helped fix the position of the owner of the bird and the Egyptian's music preference, respectively.
* The remaining clues were used to fill in the gaps and ensure consistency.

The solution is:

| Nationality   | egyptian| italian | thai       |
| Pet           | hedgehog| goldfish| horse      |

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning:


* Clue 2 tells us that peas is to the left of mirinda, so peas must be in column 1.
* Clue 3 tells us that hedgehog is to the left of family movies, so hedgehog must be in column 1 and family movies must be in column 1 or 2. But clue 10 tells us that artichoke is to the right of family movies, so family movies must be in column 1.
* Clue 8 tells us that goldfish belongs to the thai person, who watches musical movies (clue 4). So, musical movies and goldfish are in column 3.
* Clue 5 tells us that satire movies is not folk music. Since satire is in column 2, folk must be in column 1 or 3. But clue 6 tells us that lemonade is not to the left of folk, so folk cannot be in column 1. Therefore, folk is in column 3.
* Clue 9 tells us that artichoke is not folk music, and clue 11 tells us that kiwi is not hip-hop. So, soul must be the music genre for the person eating kiwi (column 3).
* Clue 12 tells us that egyptian is to the left of italian. Since italian cannot be in column 1 (because peas is there), they must be in columns 2 and 3. But clue 7 tells us that artichoke is not to the right of hip-hop, so hip-hop must be in column 1.
* Clue 13 tells us that mirinda is in the middle.

Lv8-6x3-5	"Here's my attempt at solving the logic puzzle:


|               |    1    |    2     |     3      |
| Beverage      | cola    | lemonade | sprite     |
| Job           | designer| accountant| doctor     |
| Movie-Genre   | musical | sports   | western    |
| Music-Genre   | rock    | jazz     | dubstep    |
| Nationality   | colombian| turkish  | canadian   |
| Pet           | rat      | turtle   | mouse      |

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


From clue 2, we know that the fan of dubstep is to the left of the person drinking sprite. This means that sprite must be in either position 3 or 2.

From clue 9, we know that the person watching sports movies is in the middle, which means they must be in position 2.


Using clue 6, we can determine that lemonade is not in position 1 (since designer would then be to the right of it), so lemonade must be either in position 2 or 3. But since sprite is already in either position 2 or 3, and sprite cannot be next to lemonade, this means that lemonade must be in position 2.


Now we know that sports movies (position 2) are paired with lemonade (position 2).


From clue 8, the designer is somewhere to the right of cola. This means that cola cannot be in position 3 (since there's no room for designer), so cola must be either in position 1 or 2.


But since lemonade already occupies position 2, and cola can't be next to it (from clue 10), this means that cola must be in position 1.


From clue 5, we know that rock is on the left of colombian. Since rock must be paired with a beverage other than cola or sprite, this means that rock must be paired with lemonade (position 2). And since designer is to the right of cola (position 1), and also to the left or right of lemonade (position 2), this means that designer must be in position 3.


From clue 10, we know that accountant is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola. This means that accountant cannot be in position 1 (since it's already occupied by cola), so accountant must be either in position 2 or 3.


However, since sports movies are paired with lemonade (position 2), and rock music is also paired with lemonade (position 2), this means that accountant can only occupy position 3. And since designer already occupies position 3, this means that the order of jobs must be: designer, accountant, doctor.


From clue 11, we know that the canadian cannot be to the left of turkish. This means that turkish must be either in position 1 or 2. Since colombian is paired with rock music (position 2), and rock music can't be next to dubstep (from clue 5), this means that colombian cannot occupy position 1.


However, since designer occupies position 3, and accountant occupies position 2, this leaves only one remaining spot for turkish: position 1. And since canadian is not the owner of rat (clue 4), this means that canadian must be paired with either mouse or turtle.


From clue 7, we know that the owner of mouse is on the right of rock music. Since rock music occupies position 2, this means that mouse can only occupy position 3.


But since designer already occupies position 3, and accountant occupies position 2 (rock music), this means that mouse must be paired with doctor (position 3). And since turtle is between musical movies and jazz music (from clue 1), this means that canadian must be the owner of turtle.


And finally, from clue 4, we know that colombian is not the owner of rat. This means that turkish or colombian must own rat, but since colombian is paired with rock music, which can't be next to dubstep (from clue 5), this leaves only one possibility: colombian owns rat.


Here's the final solution table:

Lv8-6x3-7	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |     1      |     2     |     3      |
| Food          | Spinach   | Peach    | Cabbage  |
| Movie-Genre   | Drama     | Sports   | Superhero|
| Nationality   | Pakistani | Indonesian| Australian|
| Pet           | Hedgehog  | Goldfish | Pony     |
| Sport         | Rowing    | Parkour  | Biathlon |
| Transport     | Quad-bike | Scooter  | Boat     |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* Clue 9: The person eating spinach is on the left of the owner of the hedgehog, so Spinach must be in column 1.
* Clue 8: The owner of the hedgehog is on the far left or far right, and since Spinach is already in column 1, Hedgehog must also be in column 1.
* Clue 3: The owner of the goldfish is between the person who's sport is parkour and the person eating peach. Since Peach is not in column 1 (because Spinach is there), it must be in column 2 or 3. Goldfish cannot be in column 3 because then Parkour would have to be in column 4, which doesn't exist.
* Clue 10: The owner of the pony is not the person eating cabbage, and since Pony is already assigned to a person (because of clue 5), Cabbage must be eaten by someone else. Given that Peach is already in column 2, Cabbage must be in column 3.
* Clue 4: The person driving the scooter is on the left or right of the person eating peach, so Scooter must be in either column 1 or 3. However, since Quad-bike and Boat are already assigned to other columns (due to clue 11 and the fact that Hedgehog is in column 1), Scooter must be in column 2.
* Clue 5: The owner of the pony is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is biathlon. Since Pony is already assigned to a person, Biathlon must be in column 3.
* Clue 7: The Indonesian is on the right of the Pakistani, so they must be in columns 2 and 1 respectively (or vice versa). However, since Australian is not mentioned as being related to any specific nationality, it's likely that Australian is in column 3. This leaves columns 1 and 2 for Pakistani and Indonesian.
* Clue 6: The person watching drama movies is not to the right of the person who's sport is biathlon, so Drama must be in either column 1 or 2.
* Clue 11: The person watching sports movies is somewhere between the person watching drama movies and the person driving the quad-bike. Since Sports cannot be in column 3 (because Biathlon is there), it must be in column 2.

Putting all these clues together, we arrive at the solution above.


#############"
Lv8-6x3-8	"Here's the step-by-step solution:


From clue 8, we know the person driving the quad-bike is in the middle, so the transport column becomes:

| Transport     | bus    | quad-bike | motorbike |

From clue 10, we know the person eating watermelon is the person driving the bus. From clue 5, we know the person who's sport is cricket is not to the left of the person eating watermelon, so cricket must be in column 3. From clue 7, we know the person who's sport is soccer is on the far right, and since cricket is already in column 3, soccer can only be in column 2 is not possible (cricket would then be to its left), so soccer must be in column 3 as well. But wait, that means there are two sports in column 3! That's impossible. This means clue 7 and clue 5 are contradictory if we don't assume one thing: the person who's sport is cricket is actually on the far right (column 3). Now soccer can be in column 2.


From clue 6, we know the person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the right of the american. From clue 13, we know the polish is somewhere to the left of the person watching superhero movies. Since there are only three columns, this means that the polish must be in column 1 and the person watching superhero movies must be in column 3.


From clue 14, we know the person eating lemon is the polish.


Now we have:


|               |      1      |     2      |     3      |
| Food          | lemon    |            | watermelon |

| Pet           |            |            |            |
| Sport         |            | soccer     | cricket     |
| Transport     | bus       | quad-bike  | motorbike   |

From clue 11, we know the owner of the rat is not the american. Since there are only three nationalities, this means that either the person in column 2 or column 3 must be the american.


From clue 12, we know the owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the right of the person driving the quad-bike. This means that the chinchilla can't be in column 1 (polish) and it also can't be in column 2 (because then there wouldn't be a pet left for column 3), so the chinchilla must be in column 3.


From clue 9, we know the person watching superhero movies is not to the left of the person driving the motorbike. Since the person watching superhero movies is already in column 3 and the motorbike can only be in column 2 or column 3, this means that the motorbike must be in column 2 (because if it were in column 3, then the person watching superhero movies would indeed be to its left). But wait! Clue 3 says the person driving the motorbike is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the quad-bike is already in column 2, this means that the motorbike must be in column 3, not column 2!


Now we have:


|               |      1      |     2      |     3      |
| Food          | lemon    |            | watermelon |

| Sport         |            | soccer     | cricket     |
| Transport     | bus       | quad-bike  | motorbike   |

From clue 1, we know the owner of the turtle is not to the left of the person driving the bus. This means that the turtle can't be in column 2 (because then it would indeed be to its left). Since the chinchilla is already in column 3 and there's only one pet left, this means that the turtle must be in column 1.


From clue 2, we know the person watching time-travel movies is the owner of the turtle. Since the turtle is now in column 1 (polish), this means that the polish watches time-travel movies.


Finally!


|               |      1      |     2      |     3      |

| Sport         |            | soccer     | cricket     |
| Transport     | bus       | quad-bike  | motorbike   |

From clue 8, we know the person who's sport is water-polo. Since there are only three sports left and soccer and cricket already have their columns, this means that water-polo must be in column 1 (polish).


Now we have:


|               |      1      |     2      |     3      |
| Food          | lemon    | cabbage   | watermelon |

#################


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 12, we know the Australian is watching musical movies and owns a rat.
* Clue 2 tells us that the person watching musical movies is in the middle, so the Australian must be in column 2.
* Clue 14 says the Australian is to the left of the person watching documentary movies, which means the person watching documentary movies must be in column 3.
* From clue 10, we know the person eating lemon is to the right of the American, and from clue 6, we know the person eating lemon is not Australian. Therefore, the person eating lemon must be in column 2 or 3, but since the Australian is already in column 2, the person eating lemon must be in column 3.
* Clue 8 tells us that the person driving the skateboard is not to the right of the person drinking Fanta, so the person driving the skateboard cannot be in column 1. Since the Australian is already in column 2, the person driving the skateboard must be in column 3.
* From clue 11, we know that the person watching documentary movies is not to the left of the person eating mango, which means the person eating mango must be in column 1 or 2. But since the person eating lemon is already in column 3, and the Australian is already in column 2, the person eating mango must be in column 1.
* Clue 5 says that the person drinking Fanta is not to the left of the person watching documentary movies, so the person drinking Fanta must be in column 2 or 3. But since the Australian is already in column 2 and the person watching documentary movies is already in column 3, the person drinking Fanta must be in column 2.
* Clue 1 tells us that the person drinking 7up is not to the right of the person watching horror movies, which means the person drinking 7up must be in column 1. Since the person eating mango is already in column 1, and there's only one spot left in column 1 for a beverage, it must be the 7up.
* Clue 9 says that the person driving the skateboard is not to the right of the person drinking Fanta, so the person driving the motorbike cannot be in column 3 (since the skateboard would be). Therefore, the person driving the motorbike must be in column 1.
* Finally, from clue 7, we know that the person drinking milk is between the person driving the motorbike and the owner of the goat. Since the person driving the motorbike is already in column 1, and there's only one spot left for a beverage in column 2, it must be the milk.

The rest of the columns fall into place based on the remaining clues and logical deductions."
