Lv8-1x7-1	"After analyzing the given clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |      1       |     2     |    3     |      4      |  5   |  6  |   7    |

|               |  Martial-arts |   Spy     |   Epic   | Zombie      | Disaster | Documentary | Animation |


Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how I arrived at this solution:


From clue (2), we know the person watching epic movies is between spy and martial-arts. Since epic can't be on either end, it must occupy position 3.


Clue (7) tells us that spy is on the left or right of epic. If spy were to the right of epic, it would contradict clue (2). So, spy must be to the left of epic in position 2.


From clue (8), we know spy is between martial-arts and zombie. This implies that martial-arts occupies position 1.


Now, considering clue (10), which states animation is to the left of disaster, but from clue (3) disaster is between spy and animation. Since animation can't be on either end (because it has to be right of martial-arts as per clue 1), animation must occupy position 7. Disaster then occupies an odd position (5), satisfying clue (6).


From clue (4), disaster is left of documentary, so documentary takes the last available spot in position 6.


Clue (9) states that documentary can't be to the right of epic. This condition is already satisfied with our arrangement.


The only remaining genre is zombie, which, according to clue (8), should be between martial-arts and spy. The only available spot for this is position 4.


Thus, we get:

Lv8-1x7-2	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a possible solution:


|         |   1    |    2     |    3     |     4      |       5       |    6     |      7       |

#############
| Sport   | Skiing | Lacrosse | Swimming | Water-polo | Climbing | Snowboarding | Skateboarding|
#############


Let me explain how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 4, we know that lacrosse is in an even position. Since there are only two even positions left of the middle (2 and 4), lacrosse must be in one of those.

Clue 6 states that skiing is to the left of lacrosse. Given the possible positions for lacrosse, this means skiing can only be in position 1 or 3 if lacrosse is in position 2, but since clue 8 says swimming is to the left of water-polo and there's no room for water-polo on the right side of lacrosse, we conclude that skiing must be in position 1.

Now, looking at clue 9, which states that water-polo is in an even position, we can see that the only remaining even position is 4. Clue 8 confirms this by stating that swimming is to the left of water-polo.

From clue 3, we know that swimming is to the right of lacrosse. Since lacrosse is already determined to be in either position 2 or 4, and water-polo is taking up position 4, lacrosse must be in position 2, which means swimming can only fit into position 3.

Clue 10 says that snowboarding cannot be to the left of climbing. This leaves us with two possible positions for climbing: 5 or 6. Since clue 7 states that climbing is to the left of snowboarding and we already have skiing in position 1, the order must be: climbing (in 5) -> snowboarding.

Finally, clue 2 tells us that skateboarding is somewhere to the left of climbing. With all other positions filled, this means skateboarding can only fit into position 7.

From clue 2, woodworking is in an even position. From clue 6, it's not to the right of chess. Since chess must be in an odd position (clue 8), woodworking can't be in position 4. Let's place woodworking in position 2 or 6 for now.

From clue 8, chess is in an odd position. Let's place chess in position 1 or 3 or 5 or 7.

From clue 4, puzzles is on the left or right of reading. Since reading is already to the right of puzzles (clue 10), let's place puzzles in position 3.


| Hobby   |         |    W     |    Puzz    |      R      |   D   |    6    |    7    |

From clue 5, filmmaking is on the left or right of reading. Since reading is already to the right of puzzles (clue 10), let's place filmmaking in position 1 or 7.


| Hobby   |     F     |    W     |    Puzz    |      R      |   D   |    6    |         |

From clue 9, chess is not to the right of drawing. Since chess can only be in an odd position (clue 8), let's place chess in position 1, which is already occupied by filmmaking. So, chess must be in position 5 or 7.

Now we have:


* Filmmaking (F) in position 1
* Woodworking (W) in position 2 or 6
* Puzzles in position 3
* Reading (R) in position 4
* Drawing (Drw) in position 5
* Chess (C) in position 7

To satisfy clue 9, chess can't be to the right of drawing. So, let's place chess in position 7.

Finally, dancing (D) must go in position 6, and woodworking (W) can only go in position 2 to satisfy clue 2. Filmmaking's neighbor is already determined by clue 5.

Lv8-1x7-4	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 1, we know that 7up is between cola and coffee.

From clue 3, we know that coffee is to the left of milk.

Combining these two clues, we can deduce that the order is: ..., coffee, ..., 7up, ...

From clue 2, we know that milk is to the right of coffee. Since coffee is already on the left side, milk must be in one of the middle columns.

From clue 4, we know that juice is between soy-milk and coffee.

From clue 5, we know that soy-milk is between juice and fanta.

Combining these two clues, we can deduce that the order is: ..., coffee, juice, soy-milk, fanta, ...

Since 7up is to the right of cola (from clue 1) and fanta is to the right of 7up (from clue 10), we know that the order is: ..., cola, 7up, ..., fanta, ...

Now let's fill in the remaining gaps:

* From clue 6, we know that soy-milk is between juice and fanta.
* From clue 9, we know that soy-milk is not to the left of fanta. This means that soy-milk must be to the right of juice.

Here is the final solution:

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From statement 6, we know family is to the left of crime. This gives us Family-Crime.
* Statement 2 tells us that thriller is to the right of crime, so we have Family-Crime-Thriller.
* Since disaster is in an even position (statement 7), it must be either 2 or 4. But if it were 2, family would be to the left of disaster, which contradicts statement 5. Therefore, disaster is in position 4: Family-Crime-?-Disaster-Thriller.
* Statement 3 tells us that superhero is to the left of martial-arts. Since martial-arts can't be in position 1 (there's no room for mystery on either side), it must be at least in position 5 or later. Similarly, statement 8 implies that superhero is to the left of mystery.
* Statement 4 tells us that mystery is not to the left of martial-arts. Given the constraints from statements 3 and 8, this means that mystery must be between disaster and martial-arts.
* Finally, we can fill in the blanks: Superhero-Family-Crime-Disaster-Mystery-Martial-arts-Thriller.

Lv8-1x7-6	"Let's break down the clues step by step:


From clue 1, we know the Italian is on the left of the Chinese.


From clue 3 and 6, we know the Spanish is between the Polish and Brazilian, and also to the left of the Brazilian.


From clue 10, we know the Spanish is in an even position. Given the constraints from clues 3 and 6, the only possible positions for the Spanish are 2 or 4. If it were 6, there wouldn't be enough space for both the Polish (clue 3) and Brazilian.


From clue 9, we know the Italian is to the left of the Brazilian. Combining this with clue 1 (Italian on the left of Chinese), we can start building a sequence: Italian - Chinese - ? (Brazilian comes later).


From clue 4, we know the Canadian is to the right of the Chinese.


Since the Spanish must be in an even position and between the Polish and Brazilian, let's try placing it at position 2 or 4. However, if the Spanish were at position 2, there wouldn't be enough space for both Italian (clue 1) and Canadian (clue 4). Therefore, Spanish must be at position 4.


From clue 8, we know the Polish is on the left or right of the Italian. Since the Spanish occupies an even position, the only spot that fits all constraints so far is placing the Italian before the Chinese but after the Argentine doesn't fit due to other constraints; it makes more sense for the Polish-Italian sequence to be at the start.


However, clue 5 indicates the Argentine isn't to the right of the Brazilian. Clue 7 places the Brazilian after the Canadian but also requires a gap between them (since Spanish is in position 4). Clue 2 places the Polish on the right of the Argentine.


Piecing everything together while respecting all constraints yields:


|               |     1     |   2    |    3    |    4    |    5     |    6    |     7     |
| Nationality   |           |        |         |         |          |         |           |

Let's place what we know:

- Polish and Italian are together (clue 8), with the Polish on one side of the Argentine (clue 2). This means Argentine can't be at position 1 because there's no space for Polish to its right without violating other constraints.
- Spanish is in position 4, between Polish and Brazilian.
- Since Italian must be to the left of Chinese (clue 1), we deduce a sequence: Italian - Chinese - Canadian. This fits as Argentine can't precede Brazilian but needs space for Polish on one side.


Given these sequences and constraints:


Polish and Argentine cannot start due to their positioning with other groups. So, placing Italian first makes sense because it allows the Italian-Chinese-Canadian block while keeping Polish near Argentine without breaking any rules.


So a possible order considering all clues could be:


|               |     1     |   2    |    3    |    4    |    5     |    6    |     7     |
| Nationality   | Argentine | Polish | Italian | Spanish | Chinese | Canadian | Brazilian |

However, there was an oversight in the explanation regarding the direct positioning of some nationalities based on clues provided, particularly with regards to how each clue directly influences others and specific slot assignments. Let's correct this by accurately placing them according to all given conditions:


Directly from the clues without further assumptions beyond what they explicitly state:


Italian is left of Chinese (1), Spanish is between Polish and Brazilian but also before Brazilian (3 & 6), Canadian is right of Chinese (4), and so forth.


Given these direct placements and considering each clue's implication on possible positions, let's realign based on a straightforward reading of the clues without speculative jumps:


Starting over with strict adherence to given clues might result in a solution that looks like this when correctly aligning all nationalities according to every stated condition without assuming more than provided:


Given this complex logic puzzle and upon reassessment for direct clue implications, let's finalize:


The correct table considering all constraints directly from the clues would indeed be carefully constructed. However, my earlier attempt at explaining each step might not have perfectly captured the necessary logical deductions due to an effort to simplify.


To correctly solve it now with strict adherence to format and logic provided:


|               |     1     |   2    |    3    |    4    |    5     |    6    |     7     |
| Nationality   |           |        |         |         |          |         |           |

Let's fill it accurately according to direct clues without missing steps:


Considering all clues and their direct implications, the correct placement would be such that each nationality fits its respective position based on given constraints.


After careful analysis of the clues provided:


The puzzle solution directly from the given conditions requires a correct sequence considering Italian-Chinese-Canadian and Polish-Spanish-Brazilian with Argentine fitting as per clue constraints.


Here is the final, accurate table after correctly applying all logic steps from the clues without deviation:

Lv8-1x7-10	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 1 and clue 2, we know that milk and lemonade are on either side of almond-milk.

From clue 3, we know that mirinda is to the left of lemonade.

From clue 4, we know that hot-chocolate is to the right of mirinda.

From clue 5, we know that iced-tea is on the far right.

From clue 6, we know that milk is not to the right of iced-tea.

From clue 7, we know that almond-milk is between iced-tea and lemonade.

From clue 8, we know that almond-milk is to the right of mirinda.

From clue 9, we know that almond-milk is between lemonade and milk.

From clue 10 and clue 11, we know that juice is to the left of mirinda.

Now, let's try to construct the solution table:

We start by placing iced-tea on the far right (clue 5):

|            |   1   |    2    |       3       |    4     |      5      |  6   |    7     |
| Beverage   |       |         |               |          |             |      | iced-tea |

From clue 9, we know that almond-milk is between lemonade and milk. We also know that almond-milk is to the right of mirinda (clue 8). So, let's place mirinda on position 1, juice on position 2 (since it's to the left of mirinda), and hot-chocolate on position 3 (since it's to the right of mirinda):

|            |   1   |    2    |       3       |    4     |      5      |  6   |    7     |
| Beverage   | juice |        | hot-chocolate |          |             |      | iced-tea |

Now, we place mirinda on position 1:

|            |   1   |    2    |       3       |    4     |      5      |  6   |    7     |
| Beverage   | juice | mirinda | hot-chocolate |          |             |      | iced-tea |

From clue 3, we know that lemonade is to the right of mirinda. We also know that almond-milk is between lemonade and milk (clue 9). So, let's place lemonade on position 4:

|            |   1   |    2    |       3       |    4     |      5      |  6   |    7     |
| Beverage   | juice | mirinda | hot-chocolate | lemonade |             |      | iced-tea |

From clue 8, we know that almond-milk is to the right of mirinda. So, let's place almond-milk on position 5:

|            |   1   |    2    |       3       |    4     |      5      |  6   |    7     |
| Beverage   | juice | mirinda | hot-chocolate | lemonade | almond-milk |      | iced-tea |

Finally, we place milk on position 6 (since it's to the left or right of almond-milk):

|            |   1   |    2    |       3       |    4     |      5      |  6   |    7     |
| Beverage   | juice | mirinda | hot-chocolate | lemonade | almond-milk | milk | iced-tea |

The final solution is:

#############
|            |   1   |    2    |       3       |    4     |      5      |  6   |    7     |
| Beverage   | juice | mirinda | hot-chocolate | lemonade | almond-milk | milk | iced-tea |
