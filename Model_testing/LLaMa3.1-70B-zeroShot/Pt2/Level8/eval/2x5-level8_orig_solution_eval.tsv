Lv8-2x5-1	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a possible solution:


|             |  1   |     2     |   3    |     4      |     5     |
| Food        | kiwi | nectarine | tomato | pepper     | cherry    |
| Transport   | boat | snowmobile| van    | ship       | motorbike |

The reasoning behind this solution is as follows:

* From clue 11, the person driving the motorbike (cherry) is on the far right.
* Clue 15 states that the person eating cherry is in an odd position, so it must be in column 5.
* Clue 3 and 2 state that the person eating cherry is also driving the motorbike.
* Clue 4 states that the person eating pepper is to the right of the person driving the van. Since the person eating pepper can't be on the far left (clue 12), it must be in column 4, with the van in column 3 or 2.
* Clue 5 states that the person driving the van is to the right of the person driving the ship. So, the van and the ship are not in columns 1 and 2 (since the van needs to be on the right). This means the van must be in column 3 and the ship in column 4.
* However, clue 14 states that the person eating nectarine is between the person eating tomato and the person driving the ship. Since the person eating pepper is also to the right of the person driving the van (clue 12), it means the person eating tomato must be to the left of the person driving the van (and ship). Therefore, the person eating tomato must be in column 3 or 2.
* Clue 1 states that the person eating tomato is to the right of the person driving the ship. This means the person driving the ship can't be on the far right (since the person eating tomato would then not be to their right). So, the ship must be in column 4.
* Clue 6 and 8 state that the person eating tomato is not to the right of the person driving the snowmobile. This means the person eating tomato can't be on the far left (since the snowmobile needs to be between them), so it must be in column 3 or 2.
* However, clue 14 states that the person eating nectarine is between the person eating tomato and the person driving the ship. Since the person driving the ship is in column 4 and the person eating pepper is also on their right (clue 12), it means the person eating tomato must be to the left of the person driving the van, but not the far left. Therefore, the person eating tomato must be in column 3, with nectarine in column 2.
* Clue 9 states that the person eating kiwi is on the same side as the person eating nectarine (either left or right). Since there's already a person eating food in every other position except column 1, kiwi must be in column 1.

With all these deductions, we arrive at the final solution:

Lv8-2x5-2	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:

| Movie-Genre   | adventure  | disaster  | zombie    | musical   | scientific|
| Nationality   | thai       | malaysian | brazilian | british   | argentine |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 11, we know the person watching adventure movies is the Thai.
* From clue 8, we know the Malaysian is to the left of the Thai, so the Malaysian must be in position 2.
* From clue 3, we know the person watching disaster movies is to the left of the British. Since the Malaysian is already in position 2, the person watching disaster movies must be in position 2 as well, which means the Malaysian is watching disaster movies.
* From clue 9, we know the person watching disaster movies is to the right of the person watching adventure movies, so this confirms our previous conclusion.
* From clue 4, we know the Argentine is to the left of the person watching zombie movies. Since the Argentine can only be in position 1 or 5 (clue 7), and position 1 is already taken by the Thai, the Argentine must be in position 5.
* From clue 2, we know the Thai is not to the left of the Argentine, which means the Argentine cannot be in position 4. This leaves position 3 as the only option for the person watching zombie movies.
* Clue 10 is a repeat of clue 5, so it doesn't add any new information.
* From clue 6, we know the Brazilian is not watching adventure movies, and since positions 1-3 are already taken, the Brazilian must be in position 4 or 5. However, position 5 is already taken by the Argentine, so the Brazilian must be in position 4.
* Finally, from clue 1, we know the person watching zombie movies is to the left of the person watching musical movies, which confirms our previous conclusions.

The final solution table is:

Lv8-2x5-4	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a solution for the puzzle:


|               |   1    |   2    |     3      |     4     |     5     |
| Nationality   | Polish | German | Indonesian | Argentine | Brazilian |
| Pet           | Cat    | Hamster| Goat       | Ferret    | Frog     |


Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 5, we know the owner of the cat is on the far left, so Polish must be the nationality in position 1.
* Clue 4 tells us the Argentine is to the right of the hamster. Since the Argentine can't be in position 1 or 2 (clue 7), they must be in position 4.
* Clue 3 says the owner of the frog is somewhere to the right of the owner of the ferret, and clue 10 states the ferret's owner isn't to the right of the Brazilian. This means the frog's owner must be in position 5 (Brazilian).
* From clue 2, we know the owner of the frog is in an odd position, which confirms our previous conclusion.
* Clue 9 says the owner of the ferret is between the German and Argentine. Given that the Argentine is already placed in position 4, this means the ferret's owner must be in position 3 or 2 (but not 1, since the cat is there). However, clue 10 also states that the ferret's owner isn't to the right of the Brazilian, so they can't be in position 3. Therefore, the ferret's owner must be in position 2 or is actually the German (contradicting clue 6), which leaves us with a puzzle solution if we put German in column 2.
* Clue 1 places the Argentine between the Brazilian and the cat's owner, confirming our previous conclusion that the Argentine is in position 4 and the cat's owner (Polish) is in position 1.
* Clues 12 and 6 rule out the Indonesian as the ferret's owner. The only remaining option for the ferret's owner is the Argentine or German. Since we already have the Argentine placed, it must be the other option left: German. We previously determined that the German can't be in column 1 (since Polish is there) or 4 (since Argentine is), so they must be in column 2.
* Clue 8 places the Indonesian to the right of the German, which means the Indonesian is in position 3.
* Finally, clue 13 states that the owner of the goat is on the right of the Indonesian. This means the goat's owner must be in position 4 or 5 (but not 5, since it belongs to the frog). However, we already have the Argentine placed in position 4. Therefore, the Indonesian must actually be in column 3 and own the goat.

From clue 4, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is to the left of the person driving the trike.

From clue 1, we know that the person drinking lemonade is not to the left of the person driving the trike. Combining this with clue 8, we can deduce that the person drinking iced-tea must be in column 1 or 2.


Let's assume the person drinking iced-tea is in column 1. Then, from clue 4, the person driving the trike must be in column 2 or later.

From clue 12, we know that the person driving the scooter is to the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Combining this with clue 5, we can deduce that the person driving the scooter and the person drinking almond-milk must be on either side of the person driving the trike.


Since the person driving the scooter cannot be in column 1 (because it's occupied by the person drinking iced-tea), it must be in column 2. Then, the person driving the trike is in column 3, and the person drinking almond-milk is in column 4 or 5.

From clue 6, we know that the person drinking tea is between the person drinking coffee and the person drinking lemonade.


Now, let's fill in the table:

From clue 11, we know that the person driving the bus is to the right of the person drinking tea. Combining this with clue 3, we can deduce that the person drinking tea must be in column 4.

| Transport   |          | Scooter  | Trike  |             | Bus    |

From clue 6, we know that the person drinking coffee is to the left of the person drinking tea.


|             |    1     |    2     |    3    |      4      |   5    |

| Transport   |          | Scooter  | Trike  |             | Bus    |

From clue 8, we know that the person drinking lemonade is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person drinking tea.


|             |    1     |    2     |    3    |      4      |   5    |

From clue 10, we know that the person driving the scooter is on either side of the person driving the trike.


Since the person drinking almond-milk is to the right of the person driving the scooter (from clue 12), it must be in column 5.


|             |    1     |    2     |    3    |      4      |   5    |

Lv8-2x5-7	"I'll solve the logic puzzle step by step.


First, let's analyze the given clues:

From clue 11, we know: colombian < brazilian
From clue 8, we know: brazilian < argentine

So far, we have:
colombian < brazilian < argentine


From clue 3, we know: cat < german
From clue 9, we know: brazilian < german (since german is not to the left of brazilian)

Now we have:
colombian < brazilian < german


From clue 1, we know: cat < fish
From clue 12, we know: ferret < fish

Since ferret is between cat and frog (clue 4), we can conclude:
cat < ferret < frog


Combining the two sequences, we get:
colombian < brazilian < german < cat < ferret < frog


Now, let's consider clue 10: frog is on the left or right of the german
Since frog is already to the right of german in our sequence, this clue doesn't add new information.


From clue 2, we know: polish > frog (since owner of frog is not to the left of polish)
Since polish is also to the left of fish (clue 13), we can conclude:
frog < polish < fish


Combining all the sequences, we get:
colombian < brazilian < german < cat < ferret < frog < polish < fish
argentine > brazilian (from clue 8)


Now, let's assign nationalities to each position:


|               |     1     |     2     |   3    |   4    |     5     |
| Nationality   | colombian | brazilian | german | polish | argentine |
| Pet           |           |           |        |        |           |

Since cat is to the left of german (clue 3), and ferret is between cat and frog (clue 4), we can assign pets:


|               |     1     |     2     |   3    |   4    |     5     |
| Nationality   | colombian | brazilian | german | polish | argentine |
| Pet           | mouse     | cat       | frog   | ferret | fish      |

Wait, what? Mouse doesn't fit anywhere!


After re-examining the clues, I realized that I made an incorrect assumption. Here is the corrected solution:


|               |     1     |     2     |   3    |   4    |     5     |
| Nationality   | colombian | brazilian | german | polish | argentine |
| Pet           | cat       | mouse     | frog   | ferret | fish      |

No, still not correct!


After another review of the clues, I finally have the solution:


|               |     1     |     2     |   3    |   4    |     5     |
| Nationality   | colombian | brazilian | german | polish | argentine |
| Pet           | cat       | ferret    | frog   | mouse  | fish      |

No... Still not correct!

| Movie-Genre   | Crime      | Disaster    | Family     | Romance    | Adventure    |

 

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clues 3 and 9, we know that the designer is on the left or right of the person watching crime movies. Since there's no other restriction, let's place the designer on the leftmost position (1).
* From clue 7, the freelancer is somewhere to the right of the designer, so the freelancer can't be in position 1. Let's place the freelancer in position 4 for now.
* From clue 8, the doctor is on the right of the freelancer, so the doctor must be in position 5.
* From clues 2 and 5, we know that the person watching family movies is not to the left of the person watching romance movies. Also, from clue 3, the person watching family movies is on the left or right of the designer. This means the person watching family movies must be in position 3.
* From clues 1 and 4, we know that the person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person watching adventure movies. Since there's no other restriction, let's place the person watching disaster movies in position 2.
* From clue 6, the paramedic is to the left of the person watching romance movies, so the paramedic must be in position 3 (but we already placed the family movie watcher here). Let's swap them and put the paramedic in position 3 doesn't work because of clue 10. So let's place the paramedic in position 2 or 3 is not possible since there is no space for romance movies on the left of it, hence let's keep family movies at #3
* From clues 1 and 4 we know that disaster movie must be to left of adventure movie hence the order should follow.  
 Hence Romance can only go with #4 
 The remaining position is electrician 

 This solution satisfies all the given conditions.
