Lv8-5x4-1	"After solving the puzzle, I arrived at the following solution:


|             |    1     |     2     |      3       |      4      |
| Beverage    |          |           |              |             |
| Food        | avocado  | artichoke | radish        | cabbage     |
| Job         | teacher   | doctor    | photographer | coach       |
| Sport       | cycling   | water-polo| parkour      | baseball    |
| Transport   | skateboard| airplane  | bus          | subway      |

Here's how I deduced the solution:


From statement 3, we know that avocado is on the far left.
Statement 4 tells us that artichoke is with cycling.
Statement 5 indicates that the person driving the skateboard is to the right of the person eating artichoke (cycling).
Statement 9 says that subway is with almond-milk.
From statement 11, we know that juice is in an even position (2 or 4), and from statement 10, soy-milk is to the left of juice. Therefore, soy-milk must be in position 1 (avocado) or 3, but since avocado is already taken by teacher (deduced later), soy-milk must be with cabbage in position 3.
Statement 7 tells us that parkour is to the right of doctor, and statement 8 says that parkour is not to the left of airplane. Therefore, parkour must be in position 3 or 4, but since cycling (artichoke) is already in position 2, and the person driving the skateboard (position 1) is to the left of subway (almond-milk), parkour cannot be with cabbage (soy-milk). Thus, parkour must be with radish.
Statement 13 tells us that teacher is not to the right of lemonade. Since teacher is already in position 1, lemonade cannot be in positions 2 or 3. Therefore, lemonade must be in position 4 (but we know that juice is in an even position, so lemonade cannot be with cabbage). Lemonade must be with radish.
Statement 12 indicates that skateboard is to the left or right of airplane. Since skateboard is already in position 1, and airplane cannot be in positions 3 or 4, airplane must be in position 2 (with artichoke).
Statement 14 says that skateboard is somewhere to the left of subway. Therefore, the order for transport is: skateboard, airplane, bus, subway.
From statement 15, we know that cycling is to the left of parkour. Since cycling is with artichoke and parkour is with radish, cycling must be in position 2 (artichoke) and parkour must be in position 3 (radish).
Statement 16 tells us that photographer is on the left of water-polo.

Combining all these deductions, we get the final solution:

| Transport     | airplane      | train       | boat           | helicopter|

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning:

From clue 1, we know the social-worker is to the left of the engineer.
From clue 13, we know the fan of electronic is on the left of the coach. Since the fan of electronic cannot be to the right of the person who's hobby is cooking (clue 11), the fan of electronic must be in column 1.
Clue 3 tells us that the person driving the train is a fan of salsa, so salsa must be in column 3.
Clue 7 indicates that the person driving the train is on the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing. Since sailing cannot be to the left of rock (clue 14), sailing must be in column 3.
Now we can use clue 6 to determine the order of skateboarding and baking: since the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person who's hobby is baking, baking must be in column 4.
From clue 10, we know that the person driving the helicopter is a fan of rock. Clue 8 tells us that the person who's sport is volleyball is between the person who's hobby is cooking and the person driving the helicopter, so cooking must be in column 3.
Using clue 9, we can determine that the engineer is to the right of the person who's sport is soccer.

| Sport         | skiing      | badminton | tennis    | rowing    |

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 19, we know the person eating strawberry is in an odd position. Since there are only four positions, this means they must be in either position 1 or 3.

Clue 5 tells us that the person eating strawberry is to the left of the person eating zucchini. Clue 16 says that the person eating zucchini is to the left of the malaysian.

Combining these clues with clue 4, we can conclude that the order must be: strawberry, radish, zucchini, ??? (since the japanese is not to the right of the person eating strawberry).

From clue 15, we know the indonesian watches scientific movies. Clue 1 says that this person is on the right of the owner of the ferret.

Clue 10 tells us that the person watching sports movies is between the owner of the rat and the owner of the ferret.

Using clues 7 and 13, we can determine that the indonesian (scientific movies) is in position 4, with the malaysian to their left. The person eating radish must be either the dutch or the malaysian.

From clue 6, we know the japanese does not eat radish, so it must be the dutch who eats strawberry and the malaysian who eats radish.

Now we have:


|               |      1      |    2     |     3     |     4      |
| Food          | strawberry | radish   | zucchini  | ???       |
| Movie-Genre   | documentary | sports   | ???       | scientific|
| Nationality   | dutch       | malaysian | japanese   | indonesian|
| Pet           | ???         | rat      | ferret    | ???       |
| Sport         | ???         | badminton | ???       | ???       |

From clue 3, we know that the person whose sport is rowing does not eat radish. Clue 17 tells us that tennis is to the right of skiing.

Clue 9 says that the owner of the rat is to the left of the person who's sport is skiing. Combining this with clue 2, we can determine that the order must be: ??? (skiing), badminton, ??? (tennis), rowing.

From clue 18, we know that the owner of the chinchilla is to the right of the person eating radish.

Now we have:


|               |      1      |    2     |     3     |     4      |
| Food          | strawberry | radish   | zucchini  | ???       |
| Movie-Genre   | documentary | sports   | ???       | scientific|
| Nationality   | dutch       | malaysian | japanese   | indonesian|
| Pet           | chinchilla  | rat      | ferret    | ???       |
| Sport         | skiing      | badminton | tennis     | rowing    |

Finally, from clue 12, we know that the owner of the snake is not a person whose sport is tennis. Clue 8 tells us that the owner of the snake is to the right of the person watching documentary movies.

This means that the snake must be in position 4 (since it's on the right of documentary), and cranberry must be in the remaining position.

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* From clues 3, 4, and 18, I deduced that Skiing is in an even position (4) and Handball and Lacrosse are on either side of it.
* Clue 10 tells us Jet-ski is to the left of Quad-bike, so Jet-ski must be in position 1 or 2. Since Scooter is between Banana and Egyptian (Clue 16), Jet-ski can't be in position 2, so it's in position 1.
* Clue 13 tells us Quad-bike is to the right of British, so British must be in position 1 or 2. Since Jet-ski is already in position 1, British is in position 2. Egyptian (Clue 16) and Scooter are also in positions 2-3.
* Clue 8 tells us Bird is on the left of Snake, and Clue 20 tells us Bird can't be to the right of Quad-bike. Therefore, Bird is in position 1 or 2. Since British (not a pet owner) is already in position 2, Bird is in position 1.
* From clues 11 and 15, I deduced that Guinea-pig is not on the left of Garlic, so it's on the right. Brazilian is also to the right of Guinea-pig (Clue 9).
* Clues 5, 19, and 25 tell us about the relative positions of Bird, Snake, and Guinea-pig.
* Clue 22 tells us Scooter is not Lacrosse, so it's either Handball or Volleyball. But Clue 3 says Skiing is next to Handball, so Scooter must be Volleyball.

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve it:

* From clues 5 and 3, we know the Indian is on the far left and is a dressmaker.
* Clue 14 tells us that the person watching fantasy movies is on the left or right of the Indian. Since the Indian is on the far left, this means the person watching fantasy movies must be in position 2.
* From clue 15, we know the person eating cauliflower is between the person eating cherry and the Turkish. Given that the Indian (dressmaker) is eating cherry (clue not explicitly stated but can be inferred from later steps), this places the person eating cauliflower in position 3.
* Clues 7 and 9 tell us that the architect is not to the left of the person driving the trike, and the person watching fantasy movies is between the architect and the person driving the bike. Since the person watching fantasy movies is already placed in position 2, this means the architect must be in position 3 or 4, but since the scientist (not explicitly mentioned) can't be in position 3 due to clue 15, the architect must be in position 3. However, later clues show that's not possible.
* Clue 16 tells us that the Indonesian is on the far right.
* From clues 11 and 13, we know the project-manager eats eggplant but does not watch satire movies. This means the project-manager can't be in positions 1 or 2 (since they would have to watch satire if in position 2). Clue 6 says the project-manager is to the right of the person watching satire movies, so this places the project-manager in position 4.
* Given that the person eating carrot is not to the left of the Turkish (clue 12), and considering other constraints, we can conclude that the person eating carrot must be in an odd position. This leaves only one possibility - position 3 for carrot, given the placement of cauliflower.
* The rest of the placements follow from a combination of the remaining clues.

Please note that I've used some assumptions based on later steps to infer certain things (like the Indian's food being cherry). If you want me to re-evaluate or clarify any specific part of the solution, please let me know."	{'food': ['cherry', 'cauliflower', 'carrot', 'eggplant'], 'job': ['dressmaker', 'architect', 'scientist', 'project-manager'], 'movie-genre': ['fantasy', 'satire', 'disaster', 'comedy'], 'nationality': ['indian', 'turkish', 'nigerian', 'indonesian'], 'transport': ['bike', 'helicopter', 'trike', 'roller']}	True	12	False
