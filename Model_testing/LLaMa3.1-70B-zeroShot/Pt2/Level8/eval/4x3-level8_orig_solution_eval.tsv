Lv8-4x3-1	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |     1      |    2     |     3      |
| Hobby         | chess      | gardening | collecting |

| Nationality   | indian     | american  | indonesian |
| Transport     | roller     | car       | ship       |
#############


Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 5, we know the Indonesian drives a car. From clue 3, we know the American is to the left of the Indonesian.

From clue 8, we know the person watching scientific movies is to the left of the American. This means the Indian must be watching scientific movies (since they are the only nationality left).

Now, from clue 2, we know the person collecting is to the right of the person watching romance movies. Since the Indian is already placed, this means the person watching romance movies must be in position 2.

From clue 6, we know the person driving the roller is on the left or right of the person playing chess. Since the roller can't be driven by the American (due to clue 7), it must be driven by either the Indian or the Indonesian. But since the Indonesian drives a car, it must be driven by the person in position 1.

This means the person in position 2 is driving a car and watching romance movies, which confirms that they are the American.

Finally, from clue 4, we know the person gardening can't be to the right of the roller. This means they must be in position 2, leaving collecting for the Indonesian in position 3.

So, the final solution table is as shown above."	{'hobby': ['chess', 'gardening', 'collecting'], 'movie-genre': ['scientific', 'romance', 'animation'], 'nationality': ['indian', 'american', 'indonesian'], 'transport': ['roller', 'car', 'ship']}	True	8	False
Lv8-4x3-2	"Let's analyze the clues step by step.

From clue 6, we know that the person eating mango is also the person driving the airplane. We can start by placing ""mango"" and ""airplane"" in one of the columns:

|               |    1    |     2     |    3    |
| Food          | mango   |           |         |
| Music-Genre   |         |           |         |
| Nationality   |         |           |         |
| Transport     | airplane |           |         |

From clue 5, we know that the person eating mango is to the left of the russian. This means that the russian cannot be in column 1, so they must be either in column 2 or 3.

|               |    1    |     2     |    3    |
| Food          | mango   |           |         |
| Music-Genre   |         |           |         |
| Nationality   |         | russian?  | russian?|
| Transport     | airplane |           |         |

From clue 3, we know that the person driving the bus is on the left or right of the person driving the airplane. Since the airplane is in column 1, the bus must be either in column 2 or not present at all (in which case the airplane would be alone). Let's assume the bus is in column 2 for now:

|               |    1    |     2     |    3    |
| Food          | mango   |           |         |
| Music-Genre   |         |           |         |
| Nationality   |         | russian?  | russian?|
| Transport     | airplane | bus       |         |

From clue 2, we know that the fan of d&b is between the person eating cabbage and the fan of soul. This means that cabbage and soul must be in columns 1 and 3, in some order.

|               |    1    |     2     |    3    |
| Food          | mango   |           | cabbage/soul|
| Music-Genre   |         | d&b       |         |
| Nationality   |         | russian?  | russian?|
| Transport     | airplane | bus       |         |

From clue 4, we know that the person driving the airplane is not to the left of the fan of reggae. This means that the fan of reggae cannot be in column 2 or 3 (since the airplane is already in column 1). Therefore, the fan of reggae must be in column 1, but this contradicts our earlier assumption that cabbage and soul are in columns 1 and 3.

Let's revise our assumptions:

|               |    1    |     2     |    3    |
| Food          | mango   | cabbage   |         |
| Music-Genre   | reggae? | d&b       |         |
| Nationality   |         | russian?  | russian?|
| Transport     | airplane | bus       |         |

Now, let's try to place the remaining information.

From clue 5, we know that the person eating mango is to the left of the russian. This means that the russian must be in column 3:

|               |    1    |     2     |    3    |
| Food          | mango   | cabbage   |         |
| Music-Genre   | reggae? | d&b       |         |
| Nationality   |         | brazilian | russian |
| Transport     | airplane | bus       |         |

From clue 1, we know that the brazilian is to the right of the person driving the bus. This means that the brazilian must be in column 3, but this contradicts our earlier assumption.

Let's revise again:

|               |    1    |     2     |    3    |
| Food          | mango   | cabbage   |         |
| Music-Genre   | reggae? | d&b       |         |
| Nationality   | brazilian| thai      | russian |
| Transport     | airplane | bus       |         |

Now, let's place the remaining information.

The fan of soul must be in column 3:

|               |    1    |     2     |    3    |
| Food          | mango   | cabbage   | orange  |
| Music-Genre   | reggae? | d&b       | soul    |
| Nationality   | brazilian| thai      | russian |
| Transport     | airplane | bus       | scooter |

Finally, the fan of reggae must be in column 1:

|#              #|    1    |     2     |    3    |
|# Food          #| mango   | cabbage   | orange  |
|# Music-Genre   #| reggae  | d&b       | soul    |
|# Nationality   #| brazilian| thai      | russian |
|# Transport     #| airplane | bus       | scooter |

This is the final solution."	{'food': ['mango', 'cabbage', 'orange'], 'music-genre': ['reggae', 'd&b', 'soul'], 'nationality': ['brazilian', 'thai', 'russian'], 'transport': ['airplane', 'bus', 'scooter']}	True	6	False

From clue 1, we know the German is in the middle, so:


|               |    1     |  **German**   |     3      |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |            |

| Transport     |          |            |            |

From clue 7, we know the fan of d&b is on the left of the fan of salsa. We also know from clue 3 that the person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the fan of d&b. Let's place the fan of d&b in position 1:


|               |    **d&b**     |  **German**   |     3      |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |            |
| Nationality   |          |            |            |
| Sport         |          |            |            |
| Transport     |          |            |            |

From clue 2, we know the person driving the roller is somewhere to the right of the fan of d&b. Since the German is already in the middle, the roller must be driven by the person in position 3.


|               |    **d&b**     |  **German**   |     **roller**      |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |            |
| Nationality   |          |            |            |
| Sport         |          |            |            |
| Transport     |          |            |            |

From clue 5, we know the person who's sport is lacrosse is somewhere to the left of the person driving the snowmobile. We also know from clue 6 that the person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left of the person who's sport is rugby. Since the fan of d&b is already in position 1, and the German is in the middle, the person playing lacrosse must be the one in position 1.


|               |    **d&b**     |  **German**   |     **roller**      |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |            |
| Nationality   |          |            |            |
| Sport         | **lacrosse** |            |            |
| Transport     |          |            |            |

Now, let's focus on the nationalities. From clue 4, we know the Pakistani is not to the left of the fan of salsa. Since the fan of d&b is on the left of the fan of salsa (clue 7), and the fan of d&b is in position 1, the Pakistani cannot be in position 2 (which would mean they're on the left of the fan of salsa). Therefore, the Pakistani must be in position 3.


|               |    **d&b**     |  **German**   |     **roller**      |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |            |
| Nationality   |          |            | **Pakistani**|
| Sport         | **lacrosse** |            |            |
| Transport     |          |            |            |

From clue 3, we know the person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the fan of d&b. Since the fan of d&b is in position 1, and there's no space to the left, the jet-ski must be driven by the person in position 2.


|               |    **d&b**     |  **German**   |     **roller**      |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |            |
| Nationality   |          |            | **Pakistani**|
| Sport         | **lacrosse** |            |            |
| Transport     |          | **jet-ski** |            |

Now, let's focus on the sport of the person in position 2 (German). We know from clue 5 that the person playing lacrosse is to the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the person playing lacrosse is already in position 1, and the German is in position 2, the German must be playing rugby.


|               |    **d&b**     |  **German**   |     **roller**      |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |            |
| Nationality   |          |            | **Pakistani**|
| Sport         | **lacrosse** | **rugby** |            |
| Transport     |          | **jet-ski** |            |

Finally, let's focus on the music-genre of position 3. We know from clue 7 that the fan of d&b is on the left of the fan of salsa. Since the fan of d&b is in position 1, and there's no space to the right for salsa, the only option is that the person in position 2 (German) must be a fan of salsa.


|               |    **d&b**     |  **German**   |     **roller**      |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |            |
| Nationality   |          |            | **Pakistani**|
| Sport         | **lacrosse** | **rugby** |            |
| Transport     |          | **jet-ski** |            |

We can now conclude that the person in position 3 must be a fan of r&b (the only remaining music-genre), and their sport is water-polo (the only remaining sport).

Lv8-4x3-4	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |      1      |      2       |     3      |
| Job           | Fisherman   | Freelancer  | Writer     |

| Sport         | Snowboarding| Rugby       | Ice-hockey |

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:


From clue 3, we know that the fisherman is on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding.

From clue 6, we know that the owner of the bird is also on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Combining this with clue 3, we can deduce that the fisherman and the owner of the bird are in positions 1 and 2 (in either order).

From clue 5, we know that the writer is the owner of the pony.

From clue 7, we know that the person who's sport is ice-hockey is the writer. Combining this with clue 8, we can deduce that the writer is in position 3 and their movie-genre is family (since they are to the right of the person watching romance movies).

Clue 2 tells us that the person watching family movies is on the right of the person watching romance movies.

From clue 1, we know that the person watching romance movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching documentary movies. Putting all this together, we get:

* Documentary (position 1)
* Romance (position 2)
* Family (position 3)

Now, from clue 9, we know that the fisherman is on the left or right of the freelancer. We already have a writer in position 3, so the freelancer must be in either position 1 or 2.

But from clue 4, we know that the freelancer is not to the left of the person watching documentary movies. This means the freelancer must be in position 2.

We can now fill in the remaining job for position 1: Fisherman.

As for sports and pets:

* Clue 3 tells us the fisherman (position 1) is on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding.
* Clue 6 tells us the owner of the bird (also position 1 or 2, but we already have a fisherman in position 1) is on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. So the person watching documentary movies and owning a bird must be in position 1.
* This leaves the ferret as the pet for position 2 (freelancer).
* The pony is owned by the writer in position 3.

Finally, we know that the person whose sport is ice-hockey is the writer in position 3. The only remaining sports are snowboarding and rugby. From clue 3, we can see that snowboarding must be the sport for position 1 or 2 (since it's to the right of the fisherman). This leaves rugby as the sport for position 2.

Lv8-4x3-5	"Let's start by applying the constraints one by one.


From constraint 4, we know that the person drinking 7up is in an odd position. Since there are only three positions, this means that the person drinking 7up must be in either position 1 or 3.


From constraint 5, we know that the person drinking 7up is to the left of the person who's hobby is camping. This means that the person drinking 7up cannot be in position 3 (since there is no one to their right), so they must be in position 1.


Now let's look at constraint 2. We know that the person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since the person drinking 7up is already in position 1, this means that the person who's hobby is woodworking must also be in position 1 (and drinks 7up).


From constraint 6, we know that the fan of indie is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. This means that the fan of indie cannot be in position 1, and since the person drinking sprite is to their right, they must be in position 2.


Now let's look at constraint 3. We know that the person eating potato is between the fan of indie and the person eating banana. Since the fan of indie is in position 2, this means that the person eating potato must be in either position 1 or 3. However, we already know that the person who's hobby is woodworking (and drinks 7up) is in position 1, so the person eating potato must be in position 3.


We can now fill in some of the table:


|               |      1      |      2      |    3    |
| Beverage      | 7up         |             |         |
| Food          |             | banana      | potato  |
| Hobby         | woodworking |             |         |
| Music-Genre   |             | indie       |         |


From constraint 1, we know that the person drinking lemonade is not to the right of the person drinking sprite. Since the person drinking sprite must be in position 2 or 3 (since they are to the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking), this means that the person drinking lemonade must be in either position 1 or 2. However, we already know that the person who's hobby is woodworking (and drinks 7up) is in position 1, so the person drinking lemonade must be in position 2.


However, this would mean that the fan of indie is not in position 2, which contradicts what we found earlier. Therefore, our initial assumption about the person eating banana must be wrong.


Let's go back and re-examine constraint 3. We know that the person eating potato is between the fan of indie and the person eating banana. This means that the person eating banana must be in either position 1 or 3 (since they are on one side of the person eating potato). However, we already know that the person who's hobby is woodworking (and drinks 7up) is in position 1, so the person eating banana must be in position 3.


We can now re-fill in some of the table:


|               |      1      |      2      |    3    |
| Beverage      | 7up         |             |         |
| Food          |             | potato     | banana  |

| Music-Genre   |             | indie       |         |


From constraint 5, we know that the person drinking 7up is to the left of the person who's hobby is camping. This means that the person who's hobby is camping must be in either position 2 or 3.


We can now look at constraint 2 again. We know that the person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since the person who's hobby is woodworking (and drinks 7up) is already in position 1, this means that the person drinking sprite must be in either position 2 or 3.


However, we also know that the person eating potato is between the fan of indie and the person eating banana. This means that the person eating potato must be in position 2.


We can now fill in some more of the table:


|               |      1      |      2      |    3    |
| Beverage      | 7up         | sprite     |         |

| Music-Genre   |             | indie       |         |


From constraint 1, we know that the person drinking lemonade is not to the right of the person drinking sprite. Since the person drinking sprite is in position 2, this means that the person drinking lemonade must be in either position 1 or 3.


However, we already know that the person who's hobby is woodworking (and drinks 7up) is in position 1, so the person drinking lemonade must be in position 3.


We can now fill in some more of the table:


|               |      1      |      2      |    3    |

| Hobby         | woodworking | video-games| camping |
| Music-Genre   |             | indie       |         |


Finally, we can look at constraint 7. We know that the fan of electronic is on the right of the fan of r&b.


We can now fill in the final table:

Lv8-4x3-6	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |
| Beverage      | Juice      | Coffee   | Lemonade |

| Nationality   | Canadian   | British  | Indonesian|
| Pet           | Hamster    | Turtle    | Goldfish  |


Here's how the clues led me to this solution:

1. The dressmaker is somewhere to the left of the musician, so the dressmaker must be in position 2.
2. The designer is somewhere to the left of the owner of the goldfish. Since the canadian is the designer (clue 4), and the designer can't be on the right of the british (clue 3), the designer must be in position 1.
3. The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the right of the person drinking juice, so coffee must be in position 2 or 3.
4. The indonesian is on the left of the owner of the hamster, and since the hamster can't be in position 1 (clue 6), the hamster must be in position 2, and the indonesian in position 3 (no, wait...).
5. Actually, clue 7 says lemonade is on the right of the owner of the hamster, so the hamster must be in position 1 or 2.
6. The owner of the goldfish can't be to the left of the canadian (clue 8), and since the canadian is in position 1, the goldfish must be in position 3.
7. Putting it all together: the indonesian must be in position 3 (no...), actually, no, they're not. Since lemonade is on the right of the hamster, lemonade must be in position 3. And since coffee is to the right of juice, and juice can't be in position 3 (because lemonade is there), juice must be in position 1.
8. So the person drinking coffee is in position 2.


Now I know why I had trouble: this puzzle is a bit ambiguous! There might be other solutions.

Here's my final answer:

Lv8-4x3-7	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |     1     |   2    |     3      |
| Food          | orange    | blueberry| peach       |
| Hobby         | sudoku    | singing  | puzzles     |
| Music-Genre   | rock      | hip-hop  | reggae      |
| Transport     | car       | quad-bike| skateboard  |

Here's the explanation:

* From clue 3, we know the person driving the car is to the right of the person eating orange. Since there are only three positions, this means the car driver must be in position 2 or 3.
* From clue 6, we know the person eating peach is in an even position, so they must be in position 2.
* However, from clue 1, we know the person singing (who eats blueberry, according to clue 5) cannot be to the right of the person eating peach. So, the singer/blueberry eater must be in position 2, and the peach eater must be in position 3 (but this is not possible since it's an even position). This means the car driver must be in position 1.
* From clue 5, we know the rock fan is between the person driving the quad-bike and the person eating blueberry. Since the car driver is in position 1, the quad-bike driver must be in position 2 or 3. However, since the peach eater is in an even position (2), the quad-bike driver must be in position 3, which means the rock fan/blueberry eater is in position 2.
* From clue 4, we know the sudoku person is to the left of the reggae fan. Since the car driver is already in position 1, and the sudoku person can't be to the right of them, this means the sudoku person must also be in position 1. However, this would mean there are two people in position 1! So, we need to move the sudoku person to the leftmost available spot, which is not possible since it's already occupied by the car driver. This means we have a contradiction, and our previous conclusion about the peach eater being in an even position must be incorrect.
* Re-examining clue 6, we realize that ""even position"" doesn't necessarily mean the second row (it could also mean the first or third row). Given this new interpretation, let's try placing the peach eater in the second column. This would put them between two other people, and indeed satisfy all other clues.
* From clue 2, we know the car driver is to the left of the reggae fan. Since the peach eater is now in position 3, and the car driver can't be in position 3, this means the car driver must be in position 1 or 2. But since the quad-bike driver/rock fan/blueberry eater is already in position 2, the car driver must be in position 1.
* From clue 5, we know the rock fan is between the person driving the quad-bike and the person eating blueberry. This means the quad-bike driver must be in position 3 (since the rock fan/blueberry eater is already in position 2).
* The only remaining spot for the reggae fan is now position 3, which satisfies all clues.

Lv8-4x3-8	"I'll solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 5, we know that the fisherman is not to the right of the person whose sport is rowing. This means the fisherman must be in column 1 or 2.

From clue 6, we know that the paramedic is not to the left of the person eating papaya. Since there are only three columns, this means the paramedic must be in column 3 and the person eating papaya must be in column 2.

From clue 3, we know that the person eating papaya is on the left of the person whose hobby is filmmaking. This means the person whose hobby is filmmaking must be in column 3.

From clue 8, we know that the person eating lemon is on the left of the person whose hobby is card-games. Since the person eating papaya is in column 2, the person eating lemon must be in column 1.

Now we have:

|         |     1     |     2      |       3       |
| Food    | Lemon    | Papaya   |               |

From clue 7 (which is actually the same as clue 1), we know that the person eating corn is not to the right of the person whose sport is skateboarding. Since the person eating papaya is in column 2, this means the person eating corn must be in column 3.

However, this creates a contradiction with our earlier conclusion that the paramedic is in column 3 and the person eating papaya is in column 2. This means we need to re-evaluate the clues.

Let's start again from scratch.

From clue 8, we know that the person eating lemon is on the left of the person whose hobby is card-games.

From clue 4, we know that the person whose sport is cricket is not the person eating lemon. This means the person whose sport is cricket must be in column 2 or 3.

From clue 2, we know that the person whose hobby is card-games is somewhere between the person whose sport is rowing and the accountant.

Now we have:

|         |     1     |     2      |       3       |

| Sport   | Rowing   | Cricket  |               |

From clue 7, we know that the person eating corn is not to the right of the person whose sport is skateboarding. This means the person whose sport is skateboarding must be in column 1 or 2.

However, this creates a contradiction with our earlier conclusion that the person whose sport is rowing is in column 1. This means we need to swap the sports in columns 1 and 2.

Now we have:

|         |     1     |     2      |       3       |
| Food    | Lemon    |           |               |

| Sport   | Cricket  | Rowing  |               |

From clue 5, we know that the fisherman is not to the left of the person whose sport is rowing. This means the fisherman must be in column 3.

Now we have:

|         |     1     |     2      |       3       |

| Sport   | Cricket  | Rowing  | Skateboarding|

From clue 6, we know that the paramedic is not to the left of the person eating papaya. Since there are only three columns, this means the paramedic must be in column 1 and the person eating papaya must be in column 2.

However, this creates a contradiction with our earlier conclusion that the person whose hobby is card-games is in column 2. This means we need to swap the hobbies in columns 1 and 2.

Now we have:

|         |     1     |     2      |       3       |
| Food    | Lemon    | Papaya   | Corn        |
| Hobby   | Card-games| Filmmaking |               |
| Job     | Paramedic| Fisherman | Accountant |
| Sport   | Cricket  | Rowing  | Skateboarding|

Finally, from clue 1 (which is actually the same as clue 7), we know that the person eating corn is not to the right of the person whose sport is skateboarding. This means the person whose hobby is singing must be in column 3.

Lv8-4x3-9	"Here is the step-by-step process:

1. From statement 5, we know that the person driving the bike is also the person whose sport is cycling.

2. Statement 3 tells us that the owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is cycling. Since there are only three columns, this means the owner of the chinchilla must be in column 1 and the person driving the bike (whose sport is cycling) must be in either column 2 or 3.

3. Statement 4 tells us that the person driving the bike is somewhere between the owner of the chinchilla and the person driving the tram. This means the person driving the tram cannot be in column 1, so they must be in column 3.

4. Now we know:
|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |
| Movie-Genre   |            |          |          |

| Transport     |            | Bike     | Tram     |

5. Statement 8 tells us that the person watching western movies is the person whose sport is skiing.

6. From statement 9, we know that the person who's sport is skiing (i.e., the person watching western movies) is not to the right of the owner of the goldfish. This means that the person watching western movies must be in either column 1 or 2.

7. But since column 1 already has a chinchilla and column 3 already has a tram, this means that the person watching western movies (whose sport is skiing) must be in column 2.

8. Now we know:
|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |
| Movie-Genre   |            | Western  |          |

| Transport     |            | Bike     | Tram     |

9. Statement 1 tells us that the owner of the ferret is not to the right of the person whose sport is skiing.

10. Since the person whose sport is skiing is in column 2, this means that the owner of the ferret must be either in column 1 or 2.

11. But since column 1 already has a chinchilla and column 2 already has western/skiing/bike, this means that the owner of the ferret must actually be in column 1.

12. Statement 6 tells us that the person watching horror movies is not to the right of the owner of the chinchilla.

13. Since the owner of the chinchilla is in column 1, this means that the person watching horror movies cannot be in column 3 and must actually be in either column 1 or 2.

14. But since column 2 already has western/skiing/bike and statement 7 says the person driving a car watches horror movies, we can conclude that the owner of the ferret is not in column 1 (because they would then have to drive a car).

15. Therefore, column 1 must be: Chinchilla, Horror/Car.

16. Now we know:
|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |
| Movie-Genre   | Horror    | Western  |          |

| Transport     | Car        | Bike     | Tram     |

17. Statement 5 tells us that the person driving the bike is also the person whose sport is cycling.

18. Since the bike is in column 2 and western/skiing are together, this means that skiing must be paired with western (as we already knew) and cycling must be paired with thriller (the only remaining genre).

19. The goldfish must be in either column 1 or 3 because of statement 9.

20. Since column 1 is taken by the chinchilla and horror/car, this means that the goldfish must actually be in column 3 and must watch thrillers to complete the genres.

21. Now we know:
|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |
| Movie-Genre   | Horror    | Western  | Thriller|
| Pet           | Chinchilla | Ferret   | Goldfish |

| Transport     | Car        | Bike     | Tram     |

22. The remaining sport is baseball, which must be paired with horror/car.
