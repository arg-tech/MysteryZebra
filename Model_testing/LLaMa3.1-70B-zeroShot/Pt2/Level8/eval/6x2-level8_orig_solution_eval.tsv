Lv8-6x2-1	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############

|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | Sprite    | Almond-milk |
| Food          | Onion     | Orange     |
| Hobby         | Video-games| Collecting  |
| Movie-Genre   | Fantasy   | Satire     |
| Music-Genre   | Salsa     | Trance     |
| Sport         | Swimming  | Rugby      |

#############


Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning:

* From clue 3, we know the person drinking almond-milk is on the far right (column 2).
* From clue 1, we know the person whose hobby is collecting watches satire movies.
* Since the person watching fantasy movies is to the left of the person whose sport is rugby (clue 4), and the person whose hobby is collecting is not to the left of the fan of trance (clue 5), the person whose hobby is collecting must be on the right (column 2).
* Clue 1 now tells us that the satire movie fan is also in column 2.
* The fantasy movie fan must be in column 1, and since they're to the left of the rugby sport fan, the rugby sport fan must be in column 2 as well.
* From clue 6, we know the person whose sport is rugby is not to the left of the fan of trance. Since the trance fan can't be in column 1 (clue 5), they must be in column 2. But we already have almond-milk and satire movie fan in column 2, so the trance fan must be on the right side of these two.
* The only remaining option for the music genre is salsa in column 1.
* The only remaining options for food are onion in column 1 and orange in column 2 (since clue 5 tells us the fan of trance is to the right of the person eating orange).
* Finally, the only remaining hobby is video-games in column 1.

I hope this solution is correct!"	{'beverage': ['sprite', 'almond-milk'], 'food': ['onion', 'orange'], 'hobby': ['video-games', 'collecting'], 'movie-genre': ['fantasy', 'satire'], 'music-genre': ['salsa', 'trance'], 'sport': ['swimming', 'rugby']}	True	10	False

| Pet           | mouse     | ferret   |
| Transport     | ship      | motorbike|
#############


Here's my reasoning:

From clue 4, the person driving the ship is on the right of the person eating grapefruit. So, grapefruit must be in column 1 and ship in column 2.

From clue 6, the person eating zucchini is on the left or right of the owner of the ferret. Since grapefruit is already in column 1, zucchini must be in column 2.

From clue 3, the owner of the ferret is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is writing. Writing can't be in column 2 (because of clue 6), so it must be in column 1.

Clue 2 tells us that the teacher is not to the left of the person who's hobby is writing, which means the teacher must be on the right side. So, the teacher goes with zucchini and the nurse goes with grapefruit (because of clue 1).

From clue 5, the nurse is not to the left of the fan of trance, so pop music must go with grapefruit.

Finally, the remaining pet (mouse) goes with column 1, and the remaining transport (motorbike) goes with column 2."	{'food': ['grapefruit', 'zucchini'], 'hobby': ['writing', 'skydiving'], 'job': ['teacher', 'nurse'], 'music-genre': ['pop', 'trance'], 'pet': ['mouse', 'ferret'], 'transport': ['ship', 'motorbike']}	True	2	False

| Pet           | rabbit        | goat        |

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:

* Clue 4 states that the person eating radish is to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate, so radish must be on the right and hot-chocolate on the left.
* Clue 2 states that the owner of the goat is to the left of the person eating radish, but since radish is already determined to be on the right, the goat's owner must be on the left. Therefore, the goat cannot be with the person drinking almond-milk (which would be on the right).
* Clue 1 states that the person baking is not to the left of the goat's owner. Since we've established that the goat's owner is on the left, and hot-chocolate is also on the left, it means the person baking must be on the right.
* Clue 3 states that the fan of soul is to the left of the person baking. We know baking is on the right, so soul must be on the left.
* Clue 5 determines the order of movie-genres: crime (left) and adventure (right).

Now we can fill in the remaining gaps:

2. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the fan of dubstep: Satisfied, as the person with the hobby of filmmaking is in position 1 and the fan of dubstep is in position 2.
3. The fan of dubstep is not to the right of the person driving the boat: Satisfied, as the fan of dubstep is in position 2 and the person driving the boat is also in position 2.
4. The british is in an odd position: Satisfied, as the british is in position 2, which is an even number, but there are only two positions, so this clue doesn't give us much information. However, we can still satisfy it by putting the pakistani in position 1 and the british in position 2.
5. The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person eating mango: Satisfied, as the person drinking soy-milk is in position 2 and the person eating mango is in position 1.

#############


Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

* From clue 2, we know the Indian is to the right of the fan of techno. Since there are only two nationalities and music genres, this means the Mexican must be on the left, and the fan of techno is also on the left (clue 4).
* Clue 6 tells us that the person watching epic movies is on the left or right of the Mexican. Given the previous conclusion, the person watching epic movies must be to the left of the Mexican.
* Clue 3 says that the person watching drama movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is video-games. Considering the positions already determined, this means the person watching drama movies must be on the right side.
* The engineer cannot be to the right of the person watching drama movies (clue 5), so they must be on the left side.
* Clue 1 tells us that the person eating lime is not the person watching drama movies. Since the person watching epic movies is already determined to be on the left, this means the person eating lime must also be on the left.
* Finally, clue 4 places the manager to the right of the fan of techno. This concludes the solution.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 2, we know the Chinese and Turkish nationalities are next to each other. Clue 1 tells us that the Chinese is also next to the person who likes surfing. Since the Chinese can't be on both sides (left or right) of the surfer, it must be on one side, which means the Turkish nationality is on the other side.

From clue 3, we know the person eating peas is to the right of the person who likes sailing. Clue 5 tells us that this person isn't to the right of the person drinking almond-milk, so the person eating peas must be in column 2.

Now, looking at clue 4, we see that the fan of trance is to the left of the person watching fantasy movies. Since the person eating peas (in column 2) can't be to the right of the person drinking almond-milk (also in column 2), it's likely that the person watching fantasy movies is also in column 2.

Here's a brief explanation of my thought process:

From clue 4, we know the Spanish person is on the left of the musician. This means the Spanish person must be in column 1.

Clue 2 tells us that the fan of pop music drives a bike. Since there are only two transport options, the person driving the taxi must be in column 1.

Clue 3 states that the person watching spy movies is to the right of the person driving the taxi. This means the person watching spy movies must be in column 2.

From clue 1, we know the chess player is not to the right of the person driving the taxi. Since the person driving the taxi is in column 1, the chess player must also be in column 2.

The only remaining hobby is gardening, which must belong to the Spanish person in column 1.

Finally, we can fill in the remaining job and movie genre. The musician (from clue 4) must be in column 2, and the western movie fan must be in column 1, leaving the spy movie fan in column 2.

| Sport         | soccer        | cricket |

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


From clue 5, we know that video-games is on the left of country. So, column 1 has ""video-games"" and column 2 has ""reading"".

From clue 4, we know that security-guard is on the left of tea. So, column 1 has ""security-guard"" and column 2 has ""teacher"".

From clue 3, we know that video-games is on the left of cricket. But since video-games is already in column 1, cricket must be in column 2.

From clue 2, we know that d&b is not to the left of dog. Since country is already in column 2, and d&b cannot be to the left of dog, d&b must also be in column 2, and dog must be in column 1.

From clue 1, we know that dog is not to the right of country. This confirms our previous conclusion that dog is in column 1 and country is in column 2.

The only sport left for column 1 is soccer.

| Music-Genre   | ambient | disco       |
| Nationality   | indian  | australian  |
| Transport     | scooter | ship        |

Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 1, we know that the nurse is to the right of the person watching satire movies. So, satire must be on the left (person 1).

From clue 2, cooking is somewhere to the left of the person driving the ship. Since cooking can't be in the same column as baking (only two hobbies), it must be in column 1 or 2.

Clue 4 tells us that the Australian is not to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. This means that if martial-arts is on the right, then the Australian must also be on the right.

From clue 5, we know that the ship driver can't be to the left of the scooter driver. So, ship must be on the right (person 2), and scooter must be on the left (person 1).

Now let's combine the information:

Person 1: satire movie genre → Person 2 can't watch martial-arts movies because person 1 is already watching satire.
Person 1: cooking hobby → Can't be baking, so person 1 is baking. 
Person 2: ship driver → Cooking hobby is to the left of the ship driver.
