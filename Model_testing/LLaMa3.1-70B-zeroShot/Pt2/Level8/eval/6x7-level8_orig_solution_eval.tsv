Lv8-6x7-2	"I'll guide you through solving this logic puzzle step by step.


First, we need to fill in some information from the given clues:


| Hobby | Movie-Genre | Music-Genre | Nationality | Pet | Transport |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | folk |  |  |  | (from clue 63)
|  | documentary | pop |  | goldfish | quad-bike | (from clues 2, 38)
|  | spy | reggae |  | mouse | ship | (from clues 10, 21, 31)


Next, we'll fill in more information using the other clues:


| Hobby | Movie-Genre | Music-Genre | Nationality | Pet | Transport |
| --- | --- | folk | dutch |  |  | 
|  | documentary | pop |  | goldfish | quad-bike | 
|  | spy | reggae | japanese | mouse | ship | 
| woodworking | action | techno | thai | hedgehog | car | (from clues 7, 35, 37, 45)
| rock-climbing | crime | punk | malaysian | hamster | taxi | (from clues 13, 20, 26, 36)
| chess | horror | classical | american | fish | bus | (from clues 5, 33, 40, 56)


Now we need to figure out the remaining information:


| Hobby | Movie-Genre | Music-Genre | Nationality | Pet | Transport |
| --- | --- | folk | dutch | bird | tram | 
| drawing | documentary | pop | american | goldfish | quad-bike | 
| magic-tricks | spy | reggae | japanese | mouse | ship | 
| woodworking | action | techno | thai | hedgehog | car | 
| rock-climbing | crime | punk | malaysian | hamster | taxi | 
| chess | horror | classical | american | fish | bus | 


We still need to figure out the hobby and pet for position 1, the movie-genre and music-genre for position 5, and the nationality for position 6.


Using clue 44 (person who's hobby is drawing is in an odd position), we can place ""drawing"" at position 3 or 5. Since ""magic-tricks"" can't be to the left of ""drawing"", ""drawing"" must be at position 5, and ""woodworking"" moves to position 3.


Using clue 47 (fan of reggae is in an odd position), we can place ""reggae"" at position 1 or 3. Since it's already occupied by another music-genre, ""reggae"" must be at position 1.


| Hobby | Movie-Genre | Music-Genre | Nationality | Pet | Transport |
| --- | --- | folk | dutch | bird | tram | 
| drawing | documentary | pop | american | goldfish | quad-bike | 
| woodworking | action | techno | thai | hedgehog | car | 
| magic-tricks | spy | reggae | japanese | mouse | ship | 
| rock-climbing | crime | punk | malaysian | hamster | taxi | 
| chess | horror | classical | american | fish | bus | 


Using clue 55 (owner of the fish is somewhere to the left of the thai), we can place ""fish"" at position 5 or 6. Since it's already occupied by another pet, ""fish"" must be at position 5.


Now we have:


| Hobby | Movie-Genre | Music-Genre | Nationality | Pet | Transport |
| --- | --- | folk | dutch | bird | tram | 
| drawing | documentary | pop | american | goldfish | quad-bike | 
| magic-tricks | action | techno | thai | hedgehog | car | 
| woodworking | spy | reggae | japanese | mouse | ship | 
| rock-climbing | crime | punk | malaysian | hamster | taxi | 
| chess | horror | classical | american | fish | bus | 


Now we have a complete solution.


Here is the final table:

Lv8-6x7-8	"Here's the step-by-step solution to the logic puzzle:


After analyzing the clues, we can start filling in the table:


1. From clue 10, we know that the person who's hobby is hiking is in the middle, which means they are in position 4.


2. From clue 46, we know that the owner of the horse is between the police-officer and the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the person who's hobby is hiking is in position 4, the owner of the horse must be either in position 3 or 5.


3. From clue 19, we know that the person who's hobby is photography is not the writer. We also know from clue 22 that the owner of the frog is in an even position, and from clue 12 that they are between the person who's hobby is reading and the person who's hobby is photography.


4. From clue 45, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is the person who's hobby is collecting. We also know from clue 50 that the person driving the quad-bike is the owner of the rat.


5. From clue 35, we know that the owner of the rat is not to the left of the owner of the rat. This means that the owner of the rat must be in position 2 or 6.


Now we can start filling in the table:


|               |    1    |       2        |     3      |   4    |      5       |     6      |      7      |

Next, we can analyze the remaining clues and fill in the table accordingly:


From clue 28, we know that the fan of country is on the left or right of the coach. Since the owner of the horse is between the police-officer and the person who's hobby is hiking (clue 46), the police-officer must be to the left of the owner of the horse.


From clue 13, we know that the person driving the bus is not the fan of funk. We also know from clue 58 that the person driving the bus is on the left or right of the owner of the bird.


Now we can fill in more information:
