# Nationality   | british     | italian       |
# Sport         | baseball    | water-polo    |

 

Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

From clue 2, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is to the left of the social-worker.

From clue 3, we know that the italian is to the right of the british. This means that the italian must be in column 2, and the british must be in column 1.

From clue 5, we know that the person watching adventure movies is to the left of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since there are only two movie genres, this means that the person watching mystery movies must be in column 2.

From clue 4, we know that the person who's hobby is hiking is not eating lemon. This means that the person with a hobby of hiking must be in column 1, and the person eating lemon must be in column 2.

Now, let's look at clue 1: ""the person who's hobby is hiking is not to the left of the person watching mystery movies"". We already know that the person watching mystery movies is in column 2. Since the person with a hobby of hiking is also in column 1 (from clue 4), this clue doesn't give us any new information.

From clue 2, we know that the social-worker must be in column 2. But we also know that the italian is in column 2 (from clue 3). Therefore, the social-worker and the italian must be the same person.

We can now fill in some more of the table:

|               |       1       |       2       |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate| sprite        |
| Food          |              | lemon         |
| Hobby         | hiking       |              |
| Job           |              | social-worker|
| Movie-Genre   | adventure    | mystery       |
| Nationality   | british     | italian       |
| Sport         |              | water-polo    |

 

The only job left is the dancer, which must be in column 1.

We can also fill in the food for column 1: it's apricot (since lemon is already taken).

Finally, we can fill in the sport for column 1: it's baseball (since water-polo is already taken).

And that leaves drawing as the hobby for column 2.

Here is the final solution table:

#              |       1       |       2       |
# Beverage      | hot-chocolate| sprite        |

# Nationality   | british     | italian       |

Lv8-7x2-3	"Let's start solving the puzzle step by step.


From clue 4, we know that the person driving the bike is on the far left or far right.


Since the person driving the quad-bike is already placed in column 2, the person driving the bike must be in column 1.

From clue 1, we know that the person drinking water is on the left of the person eating pear.


This means that the person in column 1 must be drinking water and eating cucumber (since there are only two food options), and the person in column 2 must be eating pear.

| Transport     | bike       | quad-bike  |


From clue 3, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is somewhere to the right of the owner of the mouse.


This means that the person in column 2 (driving the quad-bike) must own a cat, and the person in column 1 must own a mouse.

From clue 5, we know that the fan of electronic music is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is baking.


This means that the person in column 1 (left) must be a fan of electronic music, and the person in column 2 (right) must prefer soul music.


|               |     1      |     2      |

| Transport     | bike       | quad-bike  |


From clue 2, we know that the person who's sport is lacrosse is not to the right of the person who's hobby is collecting.


This means that the person in column 1 (whose hobby is not yet determined) must have a hobby other than collecting, and their sport must be basketball (since there are only two sport options). The person in column 2 (whose hobby is baking) can now have a sport of lacrosse, but this contradicts clue 2. Therefore, the person in column 1 must have a hobby of collecting.

Lv8-7x2-5	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#################
|               |     1     |       2       |
| Beverage      | cola    |     coffee   |
| Food          | peas    | lettuce     |
| Job           | paramedic | social-worker|
| Music-Genre   | dubstep | trance     |
| Nationality   | canadian | thai        |
| Pet           | pony     | goldfish  |
| Sport         | surfing  | snowboarding|
#################


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 4, the person drinking coffee is on the far right, so column 2 has coffee.

Clue 1 states that the social-worker is to the right of the person eating peas. Since the person eating peas can't be in column 2 (coffee), they must be in column 1. This means the social-worker is in column 2.

From clue 2, the social-worker is Thai, so we can fill in the nationality for column 2.

Clue 3 states that the owner of the goldfish is not to the left of the fan of trance. If the fan of trance were in column 1, then the owner of the goldfish would have to be in column 2, which means the person eating peas (in column 1) would own the pony. However, this creates a problem with clue 5, as there's no way for the person whose sport is snowboarding to be to the right of the fan of dubstep. Therefore, the fan of trance must be in column 2.

Now we can use clue 5: the person whose sport is snowboarding is somewhere to the right of the fan of dubstep. This means the fan of dubstep is in column 1, and their corresponding sport is surfing (to make room for snowboarding in column 2).

From clue 1 again, we know that the social-worker is on the right of the person eating peas. Since the person eating peas is already assigned to column 1, the paramedic must be in column 1.

Finally, by process of elimination, the pet pony goes with the paramedic (column 1), and the beverage cola goes with the paramedic as well.

Lv8-7x2-7	"Here is the step-by-step solution:


From clue 1, we know the architect is not to the right of the person who likes baking.


From clue 2, we know the sudoku hobbyist does not like lacrosse.


From clue 3, we know the satire movie watcher is next to the hedgehog owner.


From clue 4, we know the drama movie watcher is to the right of the writer.


From clue 5, we know the architect is to the right of the Dutch person.


From clue 6, we know the nectarine eater does not like lacrosse.


Let's start by placing the people with nationalities. We'll place the Dutch person on the left side (column 1), as there are no restrictions that prevent this.

|               |     1     |     2     |
| Food          |           |           |

| Sport         |           |           |

Now, we can place the architect to the right of the Dutch person (clue 5).

| Food          |           |           |

| Sport         |           |           |

Next, we'll place the writer to the left of the drama movie watcher (clue 4).

|               |     1     |     2     |
| Food          |           |           |

| Sport         |           |           |

Now, let's place the satire movie watcher next to the hedgehog owner (clue 3). We'll put the satire movie watcher on the left side.

|               |     1     |     2     |
| Food          |           |           |

| Sport         |           |           |

From clue 1, we know the architect is not to the right of the person who likes baking. Since the architect is already placed, we can conclude that the person on the left side (column 1) does not like baking.

| Sport         | Lacrosse  | Badminton|

Finally, we'll place the nectarine eater. From clue 6, we know the nectarine eater does not like lacrosse. Therefore, the person on the left side (column 1) must eat nectarine.

| Transport     |              |             |

From clue 6, we know the person driving the airplane is the person who's sport is handball.

| Food          | carrot    |              |

| Sport         |              | handball    |
| Transport     |              | airplane    |

From clue 2, we know the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is not to the right of the person who's sport is handball. Since the person on the far right has fishing as their hobby, the person with magic-tricks must be on the left.

|               |      1       |      2      |
| Food          | carrot    |              |

| Sport         |              | handball    |
| Transport     |              | airplane    |

From clue 5, we know the person who's sport is handball is not to the right of the dressmaker. Since the person with handball is on the far right, the dressmaker must be on the left.

|               |      1       |      2      |
| Food          | carrot    |              |

| Sport         |              | handball    |
| Transport     |              | airplane    |

The person with the hobby of magic-tricks must eat cauliflower (since carrot is already taken).

|               |      1       |      2      |
| Food          | cauliflower  | carrot    |

| Sport         |              | handball    |
| Transport     |              | airplane    |

The person who's hobby is magic-tricks must watch documentary movies (since the person on the far right watches animation).

|               |      1       |      2      |
| Food          | cauliflower  | carrot    |
| Hobby         | magic-tricks | fishing     |
| Job           | dressmaker |             |
| Movie-Genre   | documentary |             |
| Music-Genre   |              |             |
| Sport         |              | handball    |
| Transport     |              | airplane    |

From clue 4, we know the person driving the airplane is not to the right of the person watching documentary movies. Since the person on the far right drives an airplane and watches animation, the person who watches documentary must be on the left.

 Wait, this contradicts our previous conclusion! We made a mistake earlier.


The correct table should have the person who's hobby is magic-tricks watch animation movies instead:


|               |      1       |      2      |
| Food          | cauliflower  | carrot    |
| Hobby         | magic-tricks | fishing     |
| Job           | dressmaker |             |
| Movie-Genre   | animation | documentary |
| Music-Genre   |              |             |
| Sport         |              | handball    |
| Transport     |              | airplane    |

The person who's hobby is magic-tricks must listen to rock music (since the person on the far right listens to hip-hop).

|               |      1       |      2      |
| Food          | cauliflower  | carrot    |

| Sport         |              | handball    |
| Transport     |              | airplane    |

The person who's job is pilot must drive a taxi (since the person on the far right drives an airplane).

|               |      1       |      2      |
| Food          | cauliflower  | carrot    |
| Hobby         | magic-tricks | fishing     |
| Job           | dressmaker | pilot        |

| Music-Genre   | rock        | hip-hop     |
| Sport         |              | handball    |
| Transport     | taxi         | airplane    |

Finally, the person who's sport is tennis must be on the left (since the person on the far right has handball as their sport).

|               |      1       |      2      |
| Food          | cauliflower  | carrot    |
| Hobby         | magic-tricks | fishing     |
| Job           | dressmaker | pilot        |
| Movie-Genre   | animation | documentary |
| Music-Genre   | rock        | hip-hop     |
| Sport         | tennis       | handball    |
| Transport     | taxi         | airplane    |

The final solution is:
