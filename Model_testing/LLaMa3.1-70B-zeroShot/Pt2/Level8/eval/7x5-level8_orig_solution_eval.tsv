* The Turkish person is in an even position (rule 3), so they must be in column 2 or 4. Since they're not to the right of themselves (rule 41), they must be in column 2.
* The Nigerian owns a snake and watches Western movies (rules 6, 34). They're also in an odd position (rule 12), so they must be in column 3.
* The person who's hobby is filmmaking is not to the left of the person drinking coffee (rule 5), so they must be in column 2.

Explanation:

From clue 10, the person who's hobby is gardening is on the far left.

From clue 26, the person drinking almond-milk is in the middle. From clue 4, the person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person driving the train. Therefore, the person driving the train must be in position 2 or 4.

From clue 5, the person driving the trike is on the left or right of the russian. From clue 3, the person driving the trike is not to the right of the polish. Since the polish cannot be in position 1 (as it would leave no space for the russian), the polish must be in position 4.

From clue 28, the person drinking fanta is somewhere to the left of the nigerian. From clue 29, the nigerian is somewhere to the left of the polish. Therefore, the order is: fanta < nigerian < polish. Since the polish is already in position 4, the nigerian must be in position 3.

From clue 30, the writer is between the person drinking almond-milk and the russian. From clue 26, the person drinking almond-milk is in the middle (position 3). Therefore, the writer must be in position 4 or 5, and the russian must be in position 4 or 5.

From clue 37, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is drawing. From clue 2, the person who's hobby is drawing is somewhere between the fan of r&b and the russian. Since the writer is already in position 4 or 5, and the russian must be in position 4 or 5, the only possible order is: filmmaking < drawing < r&b.

From clue 33, the person who's sport is weightlifting is on the left of the fan of r&b. From clue 21, the writer is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since the writer is already in position 4 or 5, and the russian must be in position 4 or 5, the only possible order is: weightlifting < snowboarding < r&b.

From clue 36, the person driving the roller is on the left or right of the person driving the train. From clue 1, the person driving the roller is somewhere to the right of the person driving the skateboard. Since the skateboarder must be in position 1 (as it's the only remaining odd position), and the roller driver cannot be in position 4 (as it would leave no space for the train driver), the roller driver must be in position 5.

From clue 39, the person driving the skateboard is not to the right of the journalist. Since the skateboarder is already in position 1, the journalist must be in position 2.

#############


Here's how I solved it:

I started by using the given constraints to fill in some of the obvious answers. For example, from clue #29, we know that banana is in the middle, so it must be in column 3.

From clue #39, we know that pony is on the far right, so it must be in column 5.

Using clue #15, we can deduce that horse cannot be to the left of pony, so horse must be in column 4.

Clue #24 tells us that grapes are somewhere to the left of rugby. Since rugby is a sport, and sports are in the bottom row, we can place grapes in one of the top rows.

From clue #27, we know that jazz is somewhere to the left of time-travel movies. Time-travel movies must be on the right side of the table, so jazz must be in column 1 or 2.

Clue #35 tells us that fantasy movies are not to the right of the librarian. Since the librarian is an ambient fan (clue #3), and ambient is a music genre, we can place the librarian in one of the middle columns.

Using clue #10, we know that fantasy movies cannot be skiing's movie genre. Skiing must be on the right side of the table, so fantasy movies must be on the left side.

From clue #14, we know that pumpkin is to the right of cooking. Cooking must be in one of the middle columns.

Clue #26 tells us that biathlon is not to the left of cucumber. Since cucumber is a food, and foods are in the top row, biathlon must be on the right side of the table.

Using clue #30, we know that thriller movies are to the right of cat. Cat must be in one of the middle columns.

From clue #36, we know that rugby is not to the right of cat. Since rugby is a sport, and sports are in the bottom row, we can place rugby in one of the top rows.

Clue #38 tells us that trance is somewhere to the left of doctor. Doctor must be on the far left or far right (clue #42), so trance must be in column 1 or 2.

Using clue #8, we know that jazz is not to the left of magic-tricks. Since jazz is a music genre, and music genres are in the middle rows, magic-tricks must be in one of the top rows.

Clue #12 tells us that rugby is not the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Magic-tricks must be in column 1 or 2.

From clue #17, we know that cooking is on the left or right of weightlifting. Weightlifting must be in one of the middle columns.

Using clue #19, we know that doctor is not to the left of pony. Since pony is on the far right (clue #39), doctor must be on the far left.

From clue #1, we know that action movies are to the left or right of dancing. Dancing must be in one of the middle columns.

Clue #16 tells us that dancing is not the fan of punk. Punk must be in column 5.

Using clue #22, we know that banana is somewhere to the left of cat. Cat must be in one of the middle columns.

From clue #25, we know that time-travel movies are somewhere to the right of hiking. Hiking must be on the left side of the table.

Clue #28 tells us that paramedic is an ambient fan (since librarian is also an ambient fan). Paramedic must be in column 5.

Using clue #31, we know that doctor is on the far left or far right (clue #42). Since doctor is already placed on the far left, we can conclude that doctor is not on the far right.

From clue #32, we know that paramedic is not on the far left. Paramedic must be in column 5.

Clue #34 tells us that fantasy movies are on the left or right of soccer. Soccer must be in one of the middle columns.

Using clue #37, we know that biathlon is a sport. Biathlon must be on the bottom row.

From clue #40, we know that grapes are not to the left of action movies. Action movies must be in column 2.

Clue #41 tells us that fantasy movies are not to the right of banana. Fantasy movies must be in column 1.

Using clue #43, we know that fantasy movies are on the left or right of soccer. Soccer must be in one of the middle columns.
