Lv8-1x6-1	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a solution that satisfies all conditions. Here is the completed table:


|               |   1    |   2   |      3      |      4       |   5    |   6   |

|---------------|--------|-------|-------------|--------------|--------|-------|
|               | Sports | Martial-Arts | Drama | Action | Crime | Time-Travel |

Let's go through the reasoning:

* From clue 5, drama is on the far left or far right. Since sports and crime can't be on the extremes (clue 3), drama must be on one of the ends.
* Clue 2 states that drama is next to action, so drama must be on the left end (since if it were on the right, action would be at position 5 or 6, which conflicts with clue 4).
* From clue 7, martial-arts is between action and time-travel. Since martial-arts can't be at position 1 or 6, it must be at position 2.
* Clue 6 states that action is to the right of martial-arts, so action is at position 4.
* From clue 3, crime is to the right of sports. Sports can't be at position 5 (since crime would then be out of place), so sports must be at position 1.
* Clue 8 states that crime is next to time-travel. Since crime can't be at position 4 or 6, it must be at position 5.
* Finally, the only remaining spot is for time-travel at position 6.

The completed table satisfies all conditions:

From clue 4, we know that the person drinking water is on the far right, so:

Lv8-1x6-3	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:

#############
|       |   Rat  | Rabbit | Turtle|     Mouse  | Guinea-pig | Lizard |
#############

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue (4), we know the owner of the rabbit is on the left of the owner of the turtle. So, the order for these two pets is: Rabbit -> Turtle.

Clue (2) states that the owner of the rat is on the left or right of the owner of the guinea-pig. Clue (1) says the owner of the guinea-pig is not to the right of the owner of the rat, which implies the owner of the rat is either to the left of the owner of the guinea-pig or they are adjacent.

Clue (6) tells us the owner of the rat is somewhere to the left of the owner of the lizard. Since the rat can't be on the right side of the table (due to clue 1), it's likely that the rat is in position 1, with the lizard at the far end of the table.

Clue (3) says the owner of the mouse is somewhere to the right of the owner of the turtle. This means the order for these two pets is: Turtle -> Mouse.

Finally, clue (5) states that the owner of the mouse is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig. Combining this with the previous clues, we get the final solution:


|       |   Rat  | Rabbit | Turtle|     Mouse  | Guinea-pig | Lizard |

This order satisfies all the given conditions.

|#---------+--------+---------+---------+------------+---------------+----------|
|#         |Rowing  |Biathlon|Weightlifting|Parkour   |Surfing      |Water-polo|

 

The solution is derived from the given clues:

1. Rowing is to the left of Parkour.
2. Weightlifting is not to the left of Rowing, but since it's also not to the right of Biathlon (clue 3), and considering clue 1 and other positions, it must be in position 3.
3. Given that Biathlon can't be after Weightlifting, Biathlon should be at least in position 2 or before Weightlifting. Considering all other clues and arrangements, placing Biathlon in the second slot seems more feasible as it allows for a smoother arrangement of other sports.
4. Water-polo is to the right of Surfing (clue 4).
5. Parkour is to the left of Surfing (clue 5), which places Surfing after Parkour.
6. Considering clue 6, where Water-polo must be next to Weightlifting and given that it's already established that Water-polo follows Surfing, we deduce that Surfing cannot directly follow Weightlifting if Water-polo is to be on one of its sides.

Combining all clues, we establish the order from left to right as Rowing, Biathlon (to ensure Weightlifting isn't to the left of it and keeping in mind Weightlifting's placement for other sports), Weightlifting, Parkour, Surfing, and then Water-polo."	{'sport': ['', '', '', '', '', '']}	True	0	False

|#|# lizard | chinchilla | rabbit | snake | goldfish | rat     |

 

Explanation:

From statement (4), the owner of the rabbit is in an odd position, so it can be either 1st, 3rd or 5th. However, from statements (6) and (8), we know that the owner of the snake is to the left of the owner of the rabbit, and the owner of the lizard is on one side of the owner of the rabbit, which means the owner of the rabbit must be in either 3rd or 5th position.

From statements (1) and (7), we know that the owner of the chinchilla is between the owner of the lizard and the owner of the goldfish, and the owner of the goldfish is to the right of the owner of the lizard. 

Considering all these constraints, let's try to place the pets:

- The owner of the rabbit can't be in 1st position because then there won't be enough space for the other pets.
- If we put the owner of the rabbit in 5th position, then from statements (6) and (8), we know that the owner of the snake is to the left of the owner of the rabbit and the owner of the lizard must be on one side of the owner of the rabbit. The only possible arrangement for this would be lizard-rabbit-snake, which contradicts statement (7). Hence, the owner of the rabbit can't be in 5th position.
- So, we put the owner of the rabbit in 3rd position.

Now, from statements (1) and (7), we know that the owner of the chinchilla is between the owner of the lizard and the owner of the goldfish. Since there are only two places left on either side of the owner of the rabbit, it must be lizard-chinchilla-rabbit-snake-goldfish.

From statement (5), the owner of the rat must be to the right of the owner of the goldfish. Hence, we get the final solution:

#|#       |   1   |   2    |   3    |     4      |    5     |  6  |

Lv8-1x6-8	"Let's analyze the clues step by step:


From clue 6, we know that baseball is on the right of cycling.


From clue 8, we know that sailing is to the left of baseball.


Combining these two clues, we get: cycling - sailing - baseball


From clue 2 and 7, we know that swimming is between cycling and sailing. So, we can update our table:


cycling - swimming - sailing - baseball


From clue 3, we know that skiing is to the left of water-polo.


From clue 1, we know that skiing is on the left or right of water-polo (this clue is redundant now).


From clue 4, we know that skiing is not to the left of baseball. Therefore, skiing must be to the right of baseball.


Now, our table looks like this:


cycling - swimming - sailing - baseball - skiing - water-polo


The only sport left is cycling's pair: (which can't go in the first position because we've used that for cycling), it goes before or after swimming, but 2 and 7 say that the one between Cycling & Sailing is ""Swimming"". Therefore it must be on the end:


cycling - swimming - sailing - baseball - skiing - water-polo


Now, this fits all the clues.

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 2, the mechanic is on the far left or far right. Since the manager is to the left of the videographer (clue 4), and the analyst is to the right of the videographer (clue 6), the mechanic must be on the far left.
* From clue 3, the mechanic is to the right of the analyst, but since the mechanic is already on the far left, this means the analyst must be second from the left.
* Clue 4 states that the manager is to the left of the videographer. This places the manager in position 3.
* The architect is to the right of the videographer (clue 1), and since the analyst is also to the right of the videographer, this places the architect after both the analyst and the manager.
* Clue 5 states that the architect is not to the right of the project-manager. This means the project-manager must be on the far right, in position 6.
* The only remaining spot for the videographer is position 4, between the manager and the architect.
