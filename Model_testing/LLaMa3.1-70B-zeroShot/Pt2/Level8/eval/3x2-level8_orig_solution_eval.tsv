Lv8-3x2-1	"After analyzing the clues, I think I have found the solution:


|               |      1      |     2     |
| Hobby         | Skydiving   | Gardening|
| Movie-Genre   | Zombie      | Documentary |
| Transport     | Helicopter  | Quad-bike |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 1, we know that the person watching documentary movies is not to the left of the person driving the helicopter. This means that either the documentary movie watcher is on the right of the helicopter driver or they are in different columns.

From clue 2, we know that the person whose hobby is gardening is on the right of the person watching documentary movies. This means that if the documentary movie watcher is in column 1, the gardener must be in column 2.

Putting these clues together, I think the only possible solution is the one above.

Lv8-3x2-2	"Based on the given clues, I'll try to fill in the table.

From clue 1, we know that the person drinking Mirinda is in an even position, which means they must be in column 2.

From clue 3, we know that the American is somewhere to the left of the person drinking Mirinda. Since the American can't be in the same column as the Mirinda drinker (column 2), they must be in column 1.

Now, let's fill in the table with what we have so far:

|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      |          | Mirinda    |
| Nationality   | American |            |
| Transport     |          |            |

From clue 2, we know that the person driving the Jet-Ski is not to the right of the American. Since the American is in column 1, this means the Jet-Ski driver must be in column 1 as well.

So, our updated table looks like this:

|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      |          | Mirinda    |
| Nationality   | American |            |
| Transport     | Jet-Ski  |            |

Now, let's look at the remaining options. We have Water as a beverage and Spanish as a nationality left to fill in.

We can place the Water drinker in column 1 (since they're not Mirinda), and we'll put the Spanish person in column 2 (since the American is already in column 1).

As for the Snowmobile driver, it must be the person who's not driving the Jet-Ski. Since the Jet-Ski driver is in column 1, the Snowmobile driver must be in column 2.

Here's our final table:


|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | Water    | Mirinda    |
| Nationality   | American | Spanish    |

Lv8-3x2-3	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a possible solution:


|               |    1    |        2        |
| Beverage      | Fanta   | Water          |
| Job           | Manager | Project-Manager|
| Nationality   | French  | Australian     |

Here's how I interpreted the clues:

* Clue 1: ""The person drinking fanta is not to the right of the french"" -> The person drinking fanta must be either to the left or in the same column as the French person.
* Clue 2: ""The project-manager is not the French"" -> The French person cannot be the Project-Manager. Since there's only one other job, the French person must be a Manager.
* Clue 3: ""The manager is somewhere to the left of the person drinking water"" -> Since we already know the French person is a Manager (from clue 2), and they must be to the left of the person drinking water, this means the Australian person must drink water.

Putting all these clues together leads us to the above solution.

Lv8-3x2-4	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:

| Hobby         | singing    | card-games |
| Job           | architect  | dressmaker |
| Nationality   | dutch      | spanish    |

Here's how the clues led me to this solution:

* Clue 1: The architect is on the left of the Spanish. This means the architect must be in column 1.
* Clue 2: The person who's hobby is card-games is not to the right of the Dutch. Since the Dutch is in column 1 (due to Clue 1), the card-games hobby must also be in column 2.

With these constraints, I filled in the remaining blanks:

| Hobby       | Chess   | Puzzles|
| Sport       | Lacrosse| Parkour|
| Transport   | Trike   | Scooter|


Here's how the clues led me to this solution:

From clue 2, we know that the person who's sport is parkour (person 2) is to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. This means that person 1 cannot have parkour as their sport.

From clue 1, we know that the person driving the trike (person 1) is not to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. This means that person 2 must be doing puzzles and person 1 must have chess as their hobby.

Now that we've determined the hobbies, let's look at sports again. We already know that person 2 has parkour as their sport. Since person 1 can't have parkour (from clue 2), they must have lacrosse as their sport.

Finally, since person 1 is driving a trike and person 2 is doing puzzles to the right of them (according to clue 1), we know that person 2 must be using a scooter for transport.

Lv8-3x2-6	"Let's break down the clues:


1. The person eating cranberry is not to the left of the person watching fantasy movies.

This means that either:
- Cranberry is in column 2 and Fantasy is in column 1, or
- Cranberry is in column 2 and Fantasy is also in column 2 (not possible since there are only two options for each category), or
- Fantasy is not in column 1 at all.

2. The Mexican is on the left of the person eating pineapple.

This means that Mexican must be in column 1, and Pineapple must be in column 2.


Considering both clues, we can start filling out the table:


|               |     1     |     2      |
| Food          |           |            |
| Movie-Genre   |           |            |
| Nationality   | Mexican   |            |

Since Mexican is on the left of Pineapple, we know Pineapple must be in column 2. And since Cranberry can't be to the left of Fantasy (but it's not a requirement that it has to be right next to), Cranberry can go in column 1.


|               |     1     |     2      |
| Food          | Cranberry | Pineapple  |
| Movie-Genre   |           |            |
| Nationality   | Mexican   |            |

Now we need to figure out the movie-genres. Since Fantasy can't be in column 1 (as per clue 1), it must be in column 2.


|               |     1     |     2      |
| Food          | Cranberry | Pineapple  |
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific| Fantasy    |
| Nationality   | Mexican   | Italian    |

So the final solution is:

Lv8-3x2-7	"Based on the given clues, I'll try to solve the puzzle.


From clue 1, we know that the person driving the snowmobile is not to the right of the person eating apple. This means that either the person eating apple is in column 2, or the person driving the snowmobile is in column 1.


From clue 2, we know that the person who's sport is ice-hockey is somewhere to the right of the person driving the taxi. This means that the person driving the taxi must be in column 1.


Now, let's combine these two pieces of information:


Since the person driving the taxi is in column 1, and the person eating apple can't be to the left of the person driving the snowmobile (from clue 1), we know that the person eating apple must be in column 2.


We also know that the person who's sport is ice-hockey is somewhere to the right of the person driving the taxi. Since there are only two columns, this means that the person who's sport is ice-hockey must be in column 2.


Now we can start filling out the table:


|             |      1      |     2      |
| Food        | pomegranate | apple    |
| Sport       | cricket     | ice-hockey|
| Transport   | taxi        | snowmobile|

We're not done yet!


Since there are only two types of food, and the person in column 1 is eating pomegranate, we know that the person in column 2 is eating apple.


Similarly, since there are only two types of sport, and the person in column 1 is playing cricket, we know that the person in column 2 is playing ice-hockey.


And finally, since there are only two means of transport, and the person in column 1 is driving a taxi, we know that the person in column 2 is driving a snowmobile.


Therefore, the final solution table is:

From clue 1, we know that the person watching western movies is not to the left of the Colombian. Since the person whose hobby is puzzles is already on the left, the person watching western movies must be the Colombian.

Lv8-3x2-9	"Based on the clues:

1. The person watching epic movies is somewhere to the right of the fan of classical.
   This means that if classical music is in position 1, epic movie must be in position 2.

2. The fan of classical is not to the left of the person driving the train.
   Since classical cannot be in position 2 (due to clue 1), it must be in position 1. 
   Therefore, the person driving the train must also be in position 1 or to the right of classical.
