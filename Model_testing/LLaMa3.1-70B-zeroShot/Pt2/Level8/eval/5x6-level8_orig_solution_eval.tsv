* Placed the doctor watching martial-arts movies (clue 8) and deduced that their hobby is gardening (clue 23).
* Used clues 3, 5, and 6 to place the person who's hobby is fishing relative to the others.
* Placed the person who's sport is golf as the person who's hobby is video-games (clue 29) and used clue 17 to place them near the person driving the snowmobile.
* Used clues 11, 12, and 25 to place the pilot and the people watching animation and mystery movies.
* Placed the person who's sport is climbing on the left of the person watching mystery movies (clue 34) and used clue 22 to place them relative to the person who's hobby is camping.
* Used clues 19, 20, and 26 to place the musician and the people driving the quad-bike and helicopter.
* Placed the person who's hobby is board-games as the person who's sport is skiing (clue 16) and used clue 33 to place them relative to the dancer.
* Used clues 1, 4, and 14 to place the person watching sports movies.

#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

* From clue 30, we know that the person driving the boat is drinking 7up. Since the person driving the boat is not watching western movies (clue 1), and the person watching epic movies is to the right of the person drinking 7up (clue 25), we can conclude that the person drinking 7up is in position 6.
* From clue 2, we know that the person drinking 7up is on the left of the person watching documentary movies. This means that the person watching documentary movies is in position 5 or later. However, from clue 25, we also know that the person watching epic movies is to the right of the person drinking 7up, and from clue 27, we know that the person watching epic movies is to the left of the person watching western movies. This means that the person watching documentary movies must be in position 4.
* From clue 3, we know that the person drinking tea is on the left or right of the person watching comedy movies. Since the person watching comedy movies is not to the right of the colombian (clue 10), and the colombian is not in position 1 or 2 (since the person drinking water is to the left of the fan of dubstep, clue 18), we can conclude that the person watching comedy movies is in position 3.
* From clue 13, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is in an even position. Since the person drinking almond-milk is not to the left of the pakistani (clue 23), and the pakistani is not in position 2 or 4 (since the person driving the motorbike is not to the left of the pakistani, clue 34), we can conclude that the person drinking almond-milk is in position 2.
* From clue 16, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is somewhere between the person driving the motorbike and the fan of dubstep. Since the person driving the jet-ski is to the right of the person driving the motorbike (clue 11), and the person driving the jet-ski is not to the left of the colombian (clue 26), we can conclude that the person driving the motorbike is in position 3, and the fan of dubstep is in position 6.
* From clue 4, we know that the person watching martial-arts movies is not to the right of the person watching horror movies. Since the person watching horror movies is somewhere between the person watching martial-arts movies and the fan of reggae (clue 6), we can conclude that the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 3, and the person watching horror movies is in position 2.
* The remaining positions can be filled in using the other clues.
