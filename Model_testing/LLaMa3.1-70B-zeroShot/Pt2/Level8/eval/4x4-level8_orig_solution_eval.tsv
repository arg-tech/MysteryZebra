#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 10, we know that cycling is on the far right.
* From clues 7 and 3, folk must be in position 1 (odd number) or 3. We place it in position 1 for now.
* From clue 4, skydiving is to the right of blues. Blues can't be in position 1 (folk), so it's likely in position 2.
* From clue 8, mystery movies are to the left of western movies. Since sudoku is to the left of western movies (clue 3), and folk can't be next to western movies (since sudoku would then be next to mystery movies, which is forbidden by clue 6), we place mystery in position 1.
* From clue 9, western movies are to the left of drama movies. Since sudoku is to the left of western movies, and sailing can't be next to action movies (clue 5), we place western in position 2, and sailing in a different row.
* Now that western movies are placed, sudoku must be in position 1.
* From clue 12, western movies are on the left or right of cycling. Since western movies are already in position 2, they can't be next to cycling (which is in position 4). So, western movies must be on the left of the person whose sport is cycling.
* With western movies placed, and sailing not being able to be next to action movies, we place sailing in position 1 for sports.
* From clue 11, action movies are not to the left of electronic. Since blues are already placed (next to skydiving), electronic must be on the right of blues, which means it can't be in position 3. We place electronic in position 2.
* Now that electronic is placed, we know that blues are next to skydiving. Blues can't be in position 1 or 4, so they're likely in position 2.
* With blues and electronic placed, jazz must be in the remaining music-genre spot (position 4).
* From clue 6, sudoku is not to the left of mystery movies. Since sudoku is already in position 1, this clue doesn't add any new information.
* Finally, we place camping next to sailing, as it's on the left of climbing (clue 1). Card-games must be next to cycling (since skydiving is already placed).
* Skydiving can now be placed next to surfing.

The final solution satisfies all clues."	{'hobby': ['sudoku', 'camping', 'skydiving', 'card-games'], 'movie-genre': ['mystery', 'western', 'action', 'drama'], 'music-genre': ['folk', 'electronic', 'blues', 'jazz'], 'sport': ['sailing', 'climbing', 'surfing', 'cycling']}	True	8	False

Lv8-4x4-6	"After carefully analyzing the given clues, I've managed to solve the puzzle. Here's the solution:


|               |     1     |    2    |     3      |     4     |

| Nationality   | thai      | dutch   | nigerian   | argentine |
| Transport     | quad-bike | van     | scooter    | bus       |


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 5, the Nigerian drives a scooter. Clue 9 indicates that the manager is to the left of the person driving a scooter.

Clue 8 states that the manager is between the person driving a scooter and the person drinking Sprite. Since the Dutch is not drinking sprite (clue 7), and the manager is not Argentine (clue 12), the Dutch must be in position 2, and the manager is also in position 2.

Clue 10 states that the van driver is on either side of the manager. Therefore, the van driver must be in position 1 or 3. Clue 14 indicates that tea is to the left of iced-tea, so the person drinking tea cannot be in position 4. The person drinking water is also not in position 4 (clues 2 and 3). Hence, the person drinking tea must be in position 3.

From clue 6, iced-tea cannot be to the right of Dutch, which places it in position 4. Clue 1 states that scooter driver is to the left of iced-tea drinker, placing the scooter driver in position 3.

The only job left for position 2 is manager (clue 8), and the musician must be on the right side of freelancer (clue 11). The last job for position 1 is freelancer. Argentine is not a manager (clue 12) and thus must be the pilot in position 4.

Finally, clue 13 states that Dutch is to the right of sprite drinker. Since sprite cannot be the Thai's beverage (clue 7), it places the sprite drinker as the freelancer, leaving water for the Thai and quad-bike transport.

Here's the explanation for each row:


Beverage: 
* From clue 13, soy-milk is on the right of 7up. 
* From clue 14, d&b is on the right of tea, so tea must be in column 2.
* Iced-tea can only fit in column 1.

Music-Genre:
* From clue 9, gospel is between 7up and reggae. Since soy-milk is already to the right of 7up (clue 13), gospel must be in column 3.
* From clue 5, d&b is not to the left of gospel, so d&b must be in column 1.
* Reggae can only fit in column 4.
* Dubstep can only fit in column 2.

Nationality:
* From clue 15, indian is to the right of dutch. 
* From clue 11, gospel (column 3) is to the left of indian, so indian must be in column 4.
* Dutch can only fit in column 1.
* Pakistani can only fit in column 2.

Pet:
* From clue 6, hedgehog is to the left of 7up (column 3), so hedgehog must be in column 2 or 1. 
* Since mouse cannot be to the right of hedgehog (clue 1) and cannot be to the right of d&b (clue 12), mouse must be in column 2.
* Lizard can only fit in column 1.
* Bird is to the right of indian (clue 2), so bird must be in column 4.

Lv8-4x4-8	"After solving the puzzle, I got the following solution:


|             |      1      |       2       |     3      |      4       |
| Beverage    |  milk      | water         | iced-tea   | tea          |
| Hobby       | hiking     | skydiving     | video-games| card-games   |
| Job         | electrician| videographer  | librarian  | social-worker|
| Transport   | taxi        | trike         | bus         | airplane     |

Please let me explain the steps I took to solve this puzzle:


From clue 11, we know the electrician is on the far left.


From clue 12, we know the videographer is on the far right.


Now we can start filling in some information from clues that only require two rows.


From clue 4, we know the social-worker drinks iced-tea.


Since there are four positions and iced-tea has to be somewhere in between (due to the even position of tea), we can put the social-worker at position 3.


Now let's move on to clues that only require three rows.


From clue 8, we know the person driving the bus is between the hiker and the skydiver.


Since the electrician is already at the far left (position 1) and the videographer is at the far right (position 4), this means position 2 or 3 could be either hiking or video-games. Since social-worker's hobby isn't mentioned anywhere else, we can place video-games as the social-worker's hobby.


From clue 13, we know the person driving the trike has a hobby of skydiving.


Since there are only two positions left that have an even number (position 2 and 4) for tea drinkers and position 3 is already taken by the social-worker (video-games), we can place tea at position 4. The person with the hobby of card-games has to be on the far right.


Now let's move on to clues that require four rows.


From clue 9, we know the electrician is either at position 1 or position 4.


We already placed the electrician at position 1 from clue 11. The librarian could be on either side of the videographer (clue 1). Since there's a space between position 2 and 3 for another person to fit in, we can put the librarian at position 2 or 3. 


We know that social-worker is drinking iced-tea from clue 4.


The only beverages left are milk and water, so they must be on either side of iced-tea. Since skydiver is not to the left of the person who drinks milk (clue 14), we can place the person with the hobby of skydiving between water and iced-tea (position 3 for social-worker) but we also know that trike driver isn't on the far right, so trike can be placed at position 2. 


The person driving the airplane is not a card-game player from clue 2.


Card-games has to be paired with tea since it's already been established that skydiver drives the trike and social-worker drinks iced-tea (position 3), hiking could be on either side of skydiving but there are only two positions left for job: electrician is taken, videographer is taken so we can pair librarian at position 2 with trike.


Now let's figure out transport from the clues.


The bus driver has to be between hiker and skydiver (clue 8), therefore it can't be position 4 as hiking needs another person on its left or right side, this leaves us with two options: either put the bus at position 2, trike at position 3 which is incorrect since the social-worker doesn't drink tea, we already know that milk has to be somewhere between water and iced-tea so putting a bus at position 3 means there's no space for another transport type left.


There are only two options left: taxi and airplane. The person driving the airplane can't have card-games as their hobby (clue 2). Since tea is already paired with card-games, we know that tea must be somewhere even number which leaves position 4 to pair with either taxi or airplane but trike isn't on the far right so it's left at position 2.


So putting all of this together yields a table as shown above.

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

1. From clue 6, we know that the person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the van.
2. Clue 14 tells us that the person driving the bike is somewhere to the right of the person watching time-travel movies.
3. Combining clues 8 and 14, we can conclude that the person watching time-travel movies is in position 1, and the person driving the bike is in position 2 or 3.
4. Clue 13 states that the brazilian is between the italian and the person driving the bike. Since the italian must be to the left of the brazilian (due to clue 11), we can conclude that the italian is in position 1, and the brazilian is in position 2.
5. From clue 10, we know that the american must be on the right end, as they are not mentioned in any other clues related to nationality.
6. Clue 9 states that the person watching documentary movies is not to the left of the person drinking fanta. Since the person drinking almond-milk (in position 1) cannot watch musical or romance movies (due to clues 5 and 7), they must watch time-travel movies. This means that the person drinking fanta must be in position 2, watching documentary movies.
7. Clue 3 tells us that the person drinking hot-chocolate is not the person driving the taxi. Since the person drinking fanta (in position 2) cannot drive a van (due to clue 6), they must drive a subway. This leaves position 4 for the person drinking coffee, who drives a van.
8. The remaining positions can be filled in based on the remaining clues: the russian is in position 3, watching musical movies and driving a taxi.

* Clues 2, 6, and 10 indicate that the owner of the dog is in an even position (4) and between the hedgehog owner and taxi driver.
* Clue 3 tells us that lemonade is associated with punk music, so we can place lemonade in column 3.
* Clue 14 indicates that folk music is to the left of lemonade, so we can place folk in column 1.
* Clue 11 restricts the position of juice relative to the bike driver. Since bike is between train and salsa (clue 5), we can deduce that juice is likely in column 2.
* Clues 8 and 12 suggest that iced-tea is left of the dog owner, and the goldfish owner is left of sprite. Given the other constraints, this means iced-tea goes with the goldfish (column 1) and sprite with the turtle (column 4).
* With lemonade in column 3 and folk/punk already placed, salsa must be associated with the remaining music genre, which is salsa.
* Finally, clue 5 indicates that bike is between train and salsa. This means bike goes in column 2, and we can fill in the remaining transport methods.
