#############


Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

* From clue 8, we know the scientist eats asparagus.
* From clues 1 and 26, we can deduce that the fan of gospel is on the far right (column 6) and is not to the left of the doctor.
* From clues 5 and 23, we know the fan of house is between the dressmaker and the person driving the jet-ski, and does not eat onion.
* Clue 16 tells us that the fan of gospel is on the left or right of the person eating zucchini. Since gospel is in column 6, zucchini must be in column 5.
* Clue 25 tells us that the photographer is somewhere to the left of the fan of indie. Since indie is already in column 1, we can place the photographer in column 2.
* Clue 13 places the fan of house between the dressmaker and the person driving the jet-ski. This means the dressmaker must be in column 1 or 2, and the jet-ski driver must be in column 3 or 4.
* From clues 10 and 30, we can deduce that the architect is on the right of the fan of trance (column 5) and is not to the left of the doctor. Therefore, the architect must be in column 4.
* Clue 17 tells us that the fan of trance is on the left or right of the person driving the subway. Since trance is in column 5, we can place the subway driver in column 6 (which we already know).
* With these constraints, we can start filling in the rest of the table:
	+ Clue 22 places the photographer next to the fan of blues.
	+ Clue 21 places the dressmaker next to the person eating pineapple.
	+ Clue 18 places the train driver next to the fan of gospel (which is already in column 6).
	+ Clue 19 places the videographer next to the person eating zucchini.

After applying these constraints, we can fill in the rest of the table with unique solutions."	{'food': ['pineapple', 'cauliflower', 'asparagus', 'pumpkin', 'zucchini', 'onion'], 'job': ['dressmaker', 'photographer', 'scientist', 'architect', 'videographer', 'doctor'], 'music-genre': ['indie', 'house', 'blues', 'r&b', 'trance', 'gospel'], 'transport': ['scooter', 'jet-ski', 'roller', 'train', 'motorbike', 'subway']}	True	5	False

|             |    1     |     2      |       3       |    4     |    5    |      6       |

| Transport   | Tram     | Skateboard | Boat          | Train    | Helicopter| Airplane     |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 24, we know that the person driving the helicopter is in an odd position. From clue 6, we know that this person's sport is weightlifting.

Clue 22 tells us that the person who's sport is weightlifting is on the left of the person driving the airplane. Clue 9 tells us that the person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the left of the person driving the airplane. Combining these two clues, we can conclude that the person who's sport is weightlifting must be in position 5.

From clue 25, we know that the person driving the train is not to the right of the coach. Clue 12 tells us that the owner of the ferret is the coach, and from clue 15, we know that the person driving the helicopter is on the right of the owner of the mouse. Therefore, the coach must be in position 2.

From clue 10, we know that the owner of the mouse is somewhere to the left of the manager. Clue 11 tells us that the owner of the mouse is also to the left of the photographer. Combining these two clues with the fact that the coach is in position 2, we can conclude that the owner of the mouse must be in position 1 or 3.

From clue 14, we know that the architect is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse. If the owner of the mouse is in position 3, then the architect would have to be in either position 2 (but this is occupied by the coach) or position 4 (which would leave no room for the other jobs). Therefore, the owner of the mouse must be in position 1, and the architect must be in position 2 or 3.

From clue 17, we know that the freelancer is not to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Clue 2 tells us that the freelancer is somewhere to the left of the owner of the pony. Combining these two clues, we can conclude that the freelancer must be in position 4.

From clue 27, we know that the musician is on the left or right of the manager. If the manager is in position 3, then the musician would have to be in either position 2 (but this is occupied by the coach) or position 4 (which would leave no room for the other jobs). Therefore, the manager must be in position 4 or 5.

However, clue 18 tells us that the manager is somewhere to the left of the person driving the boat. If the manager is in position 5, then the person driving the boat would have to be in either position 6 (which would leave no room for the other transports) or position 1 (but this is occupied by the owner of the mouse). Therefore, the manager must be in position 4.

From clue 32, we know that the owner of the horse is on the left or right of the person driving the boat. If the person driving the boat is in position 5, then the owner of the horse would have to be in either position 4 (but this is occupied by the manager) or position 6.

However, from clue 26, we know that the person who's sport is weightlifting is not the owner of the goat. Clue 30 tells us that the person who's sport is weightlifting is also not the owner of the pony. Combining these two clues with the fact that the freelancer is in position 4 and the manager is also in position 4, we can conclude that the person driving the boat must be in position 3.

From clue 13, we know that the musician is on the left of the owner of the horse. Combining this clue with the fact that the owner of the horse is on the right of the person driving the boat, we can conclude that the musician must be in position 6 and the owner of the horse must also be in position 6.

However, from clue 16, we know that the person driving the helicopter is on the left of the musician. Combining this clue with the fact that the person driving the helicopter is in an odd position (clue 24), we can conclude that the musician must be in position 5 and the owner of the horse must also be in position 6.

Finally, from clue 3, we know that the architect is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse. Since the owner of the mouse is in position 1 and the architect cannot be in position 2 (which is occupied by the coach), the architect must be in position 3.

Therefore, we have:


|             |    1     |     2      |       3       |    4     |    5    |      6       |
| Job         |          |            |               |          |         |              |
| Pet         | Ferret   | Mouse      | Architect     | Freelancer | Manager | Horse        |
| Sport/Transport | Coach   | Weightlifting | Boat      | Weightlifting | Airplane | Musician |

This leaves the following positions:

* Owner of the pony
* Photographer

From clue 2, we know that the freelancer is somewhere to the left of the owner of the pony. Combining this clue with the fact that the freelancer is in position 4, we can conclude that the owner of the pony must be in position 5 or 6.

However, from clue 30, we know that the person who's sport is weightlifting is not the owner of the pony. Clue 26 tells us that this person is also not the owner of the goat. Combining these two clues with the fact that the musician is in position 5 and the owner of the horse is in position 6, we can conclude that the owner of the pony must be in position 5.

However, from clue 28, we know that the person driving the helicopter is on the right of the owner of the mouse. Combining this clue with the fact that the person driving the helicopter is in an odd position (clue 24), we can conclude that the owner of the pony cannot be in position 5.

Therefore, the owner of the pony must be in position 6.

Finally, from clue 11, we know that the owner of the mouse is somewhere to the left of the photographer. Combining this clue with the fact that the owner of the mouse is in position 1 and there are no other positions available, we can conclude that the photographer must be in position 4.

Therefore, we have:


|             |    1     |     2      |       3       |    4     |    5    |      6       |
| Job         |          |            |               |          |         |              |
| Pet         | Ferret   | Mouse      | Architect     | Photographer | Pony      | Horse        |

This leaves the following positions:

* Weightlifting
* Boat

From clue 3, we know that the architect is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse. Combining this clue with the fact that the architect is in position 3 and the owner of the mouse is in position 1, we can conclude that the boat must be in position 3.

However, from clue 18, we know that the manager is somewhere to the left of the person driving the boat. If the manager is in position 4 (which is occupied by the photographer), then the person driving the boat would have to be in either position 5 (but this is occupied by the pony) or position 6.

However, from clue 32, we know that the owner of the horse is on the left or right of the person driving the boat. Combining this clue with the fact that the owner of the horse is in position 6 and there are no other positions available for the person driving the boat, we can conclude that the person driving the boat must be in position 3.

From clue 9, we know that the person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the left of the person driving the airplane. Combining this clue with the fact that there are no other positions available for the person who's sport is weightlifting, we can conclude that the person who's sport is weightlifting must be in position 5.

Therefore, we have:


|             |    1     |     2      |       3       |    4     |    5    |      6       |

| Sport/Transport | Coach   |            | Architect     | Freelancer | Airplane | Musician      |

This leaves the following positions:

* Pony

From clue 2, we know that the freelancer is somewhere to the left of the owner of the pony. Combining this clue with the fact that there are no other positions available for the owner of the pony, we can conclude that the owner of the pony must be in position 6.

However, from clue 30, we know that the person who's sport is weightlifting is not the owner of the goat. Clue 26 tells us that this person is also not the owner of the pony. Combining these two clues with the fact that there are no other positions available for the owner of the pony, we can conclude that the owner of the pony must be in position 6.

However, from clue 28, we know that the person driving the helicopter is on the right of the owner of the mouse. Combining this clue with the fact that the person driving the helicopter is in an odd position (clue 24), we can conclude that the owner of the pony cannot be in position 6.

Therefore, the owner of the pony must be in position 5.

However, from clue 9, we know that the person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the left of the person driving the airplane. Combining this clue with the fact that there are no other positions available for the person who's sport is weightlifting, we can conclude that the owner of the pony cannot be in position 5.

Therefore, the owner of the pony must be in position 4.

However, from clue 11, we know that the owner of the mouse is somewhere to the left of the photographer. Combining this clue with the fact that there are no other positions available for the photographer, we can conclude that the owner of the pony cannot be in position 4.

Therefore, the owner of the pony must be in position 6.

Lv8-4x6-8	"After solving the logic puzzle, I arrived at the following solution:


|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |    4     |      5      |    6    |
| Food          | cherry     | pepper      | avocado   | lettuce  | cauliflower | pear     |
| Hobby         | reading    | card-games  | fishing   | video-games | camping    | singing  |
| Nationality   | italian    | dutch       | mexican   | australian | nigerian   | turkish  |
| Transport     | subway     | taxi        | quad-bike | bus       | bike       | train    |


Here's the explanation:

From clue 5, we know that cherry is on the far left. From clue 8, we know that pepper is to the right of the person driving the subway, so pepper must be in position 2.

From clue 9, we know that the australian is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since the australian is in an odd position (clue 29), it must be in position 4.

From clue 19, we know that the train is to the right of the dutch. From clue 26, we know that the dutch is to the left of the mexican. Therefore, the order of nationality is italian, dutch, mexican (from left to right).

From clue 23, we know that the person who's hobby is card-games is on the left or right of the person driving the taxi. Since the australian is in position 4 and card-games must be next to it, card-games must be in position 3.

From clue 14, we know that the nigerian's hobby is camping. From clue 15, we know that the bus is driven by the nigerian. Therefore, the nigerian must be in position 5.

The rest of the solution falls into place from there.
