Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

* First, I used clues 14 and 28 to determine the relative positions of the dutch person (eating potato) and the lawyer.
* Next, I applied clue 25 to place the pilot near the canadian.
* Clues 5 and 7 helped me position the colombian relative to the board-games hobbyist.
* Using clues 1, 12, and 22, I placed the taxi driver, videographer, and photography hobbyist in relation to each other.
* The combination of clues 3, 11, and 13 allowed me to determine the positions of the parkour sport enthusiast, board-games hobbyist, and sudoku hobbyist.
* Clues 8, 20, and 31 helped me position the papaya eater (car driver), freelancer, and rowing sport enthusiast.
* Finally, I used clues 16, 17, and 24 to place the van driver, indonesian, and pakistani in their respective positions.


Note that this solution satisfies all 31 given clues."

| Transport     | subway      | skateboard | bike          | airplane       | trike          |

Here's a breakdown of my thought process:

From clues 1 and 6, we know that the person eating papaya is drinking hot-chocolate and driving a skateboard.

Clue 11 tells us that the person driving the airplane is between the person eating radish and the person watching romance movies. Clue 9 tells us that the librarian is driving the airplane, so we can deduce that the librarian is in column 4.

From clue 2, we know that the person driving the bike is not to the left of the person eating radish. This means that the person driving the bike must be in a column after the person eating radish.

Clue 5 tells us that the person watching fantasy movies is not to the left of the person eating radish. Since the person eating radish can't be in column 1 (because of clue 11), we know that the person watching fantasy movies must be in a column after the person eating radish.

From clues 13 and 26, we know that the person drinking cola is not to the right of the person watching romance movies, and the person eating carrot is not to the right of the person watching romance movies. This means that the person watching romance movies must be in column 1 or 2.

Clue 21 tells us that the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the left of the person eating peach. Clue 14 tells us that the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the person eating papaya, which means that the person eating peach must be in column 5.

Clue 16 tells us that the person eating plum is not to the right of the fan of salsa. This means that the person eating plum must be in a column before the fan of salsa. Since the person eating carrot can't be in column 1 (because it would make the person watching romance movies in column 2, which conflicts with clue 11), we know that the person eating plum is in column 4.

From clues 29 and 30, we know that the accountant is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea, and the person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the fan of trance. Since the person drinking iced-tea can't be in column 2 (because it would make the accountant in column 3, which conflicts with clue 31), we know that the accountant must be in column 1.

From clues 22 and 32, we know that the person eating carrot is not driving a skateboard and is between the fan of trance and the entrepreneur. Since the person eating papaya is driving a skateboard (from clue 6), we know that the person eating carrot must be in column 1.

The rest of the puzzle can be solved using similar logic.

3. Next, I used conditions 4 and 21 to place ""police-officer"" and ""writing"" on the right side of the table.
4. Conditions 2, 5, and 10 helped me place ""documentary"", ""teacher"", and ""7up"" in their respective positions.
5. The remaining conditions were used to fill in the gaps and ensure that all conditions were satisfied.

* Clues related to music genres (#2, #7, #17, and #30) helped me figure out the positions of the fans of ambient, classical, d&b, and dubstep.
* Job-related clues (#1, #8, #10, #15, and #21) allowed me to place some individuals in specific jobs.

Note: I've used the given clues to deduce the correct order of each category. Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:


From clue 9, we know that the person driving the ship is on the far left.


From clue 15, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is in the middle (position 4).


From clue 1 and clue 6, we can determine that the fan of funk is not to the right of the person drinking mirinda, and the person drinking mirinda is on the left of the person driving the quad-bike. This means that the person drinking mirinda must be in position 1.


Using clues 16 and 30, we know that the journalist is the fan of funk, and the fan of r&b is on the left or right of the thai. We can also use clue 11 to determine that the thai is somewhere to the right of the person driving the quad-bike.


With these initial placements, we can start filling in the rest of the table using the remaining clues:


Clue 20 tells us that the person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the guinea-pig is not in an odd position (clue 23), it must be in position 3.


Using clue 27, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the right of the doctor. This means that the doctor must be in a lower-numbered position than the person drinking almond-milk.


From clues 24 and 34, we can determine that the journalist is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla.


With these additional placements, we can continue filling in the table using the remaining clues:


Clue 35 tells us that the brazilian is not to the left of the photographer. This means that the photographer must be in a higher-numbered position than the brazilian.


Using clue 25 and 32, we know that the fan of soul is somewhere to the right of the person drinking mirinda, and the fan of rock is on the right of the fan of funk (clue 26).


From clues 28 and 31, we can determine that the dutch is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike.


Finally, using clue 22, we know that the dancer is the person driving the taxi. This means that the taxi must be in position 5 (since the tram is to the right of the dutch, and the dutch is not in position 1 or 2).


With all these clues combined, we can arrive at the final solution table:
