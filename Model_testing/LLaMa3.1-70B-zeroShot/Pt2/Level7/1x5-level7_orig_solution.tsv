Lv7-1x5-1	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|             |  1   |  2   |     3     |  4   |    5    |
| Transport   |      |      | quad-bike |      |         |

Applying the clues:

* Clue 1: The person driving the quad-bike is in the middle, so it's already placed in column 3.
* Clue 2: The person driving the ship is on the left of the person driving the taxi. Since the taxi can't be in column 3 (quad-bike), the ship must be in column 1 or 2. Let's place the ship in column 1 and the taxi in column 4.
* Clue 3: The person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bike. This means the bike can't be in column 5, so it must be in column 2 or 4. Since the taxi is already in column 4, let's place the bike in column 2.
* Clue 4: The person driving the taxi is somewhere between the person driving the ship and the person driving the quad-bike. This clue is already satisfied with our current placement.
* Clue 5: The person driving the bike is somewhere to the right of the person driving the ship. This clue is also already satisfied.

Now, let's fill in the remaining column (5) with the jet-ski.

Lv7-1x5-2	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a solution:

| Sport   |        |               |         |       |      |

| Sport   |        |               |         |             |        |


Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

From clue 4, we know that rugby is in an even position. Let's place it in either position 2 or 4.

From clue 3, we know that cycling is on the left or right of rugby. If rugby were in position 2, cycling would have to be in position 1. But then, where would tennis go? It can't be between cycling and rugby (clue 5), so it would have to be either before or after them. However, this leads to a contradiction with clue 6.

So, let's place rugby in position 4 instead.

From clue 3, we know that cycling is on the left or right of rugby. Let's place cycling in position 1 or 3. If it were in position 3, tennis would have to be between cycling and rugby (clue 5), which contradicts clue 6. Therefore, cycling must be in position 1.

Now, from clue 2, we know that tennis is on the left of weightlifting. Let's place them in positions 2 and 3 or 4 and 5. If they were in positions 4 and 5, rugby would not be between tennis and golf (clue 5). Therefore, they must be in positions 2 and 3.

However, this contradicts clue 6, which says that weightlifting is between rugby and tennis. So, let's swap the positions of tennis and weightlifting. We get:


|         | cycling | tennis     | weightlifting | rugby   | golf   |

But now, we've placed rugby in position 4, as required by clue 4.

Now, from clue 5, we know that golf must be after rugby.


So, the final solution is:


#############
|         | cycling | tennis     | rugby   | weightlifting | golf   |
| Sport   |        |               |         |             |        |

Lv7-1x5-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.


From clue 4, we know that the jet-ski is on the far left, so:


|             |    1    |  2   |   3   |  4   |  5  |
| Transport   | Jet-Ski |      |       |      |     |

 

From clue 1, we know that the boat is to the right of the jet-ski:


|             |    1    |  2   |   3   |  4   |  5  |
| Transport   | Jet-Ski | Boat |       |      |     |

 

From clue 3, we know that the taxi is between the car and the train. We also know from clue 5 that the car is to the right of the taxi.


Let's place the taxi in position 3:


|             |    1    |  2   |   3   |  4   |  5  |
| Transport   | Jet-Ski | Boat | Taxi |      |     |

 

Now, we can place the car to the right of the taxi:


|             |    1    |  2   |   3   |  4   |  5  |
| Transport   | Jet-Ski | Boat | Taxi | Car  |     |

 

Finally, we can place the train in position 5:


|             |    1    |  2   |   3   |  4   |  5  |
| Transport   | Jet-Ski | Boat | Taxi | Car  | Train|

 

Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:

#############
| Job   | Paramedic | Dressmaker | Manager | Bartender | Teacher |
#############

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The paramedic is on the left of the dressmaker, so they must be in positions 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.
2. The dressmaker is somewhere between the paramedic and the manager, which means the manager cannot be in position 1. So, the paramedic must be in position 1, and the dressmaker must be in position 2.
3. The manager is somewhere to the left of the bartender, so they must be in positions 2 or 3 (already occupied by the dressmaker), or position 4 cannot be the manager's spot because it would leave no room for the bartender on the right). Therefore, the manager must be in position 3.
4. The bartender is somewhere to the right of the paramedic and the manager, so they must be in position 4.
5. The teacher is on the far right, which means they must be in position 5.

Putting it all together, we get the final solution table:

Lv7-1x5-5	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a possible solution:

| Hobby   | Magic-tricks | Skydiving    | Card-games | Reading    | Filmmaking|

Here's the explanation:

From clue 4, we know that skydiving is to the right of magic-tricks. So, magic-tricks must be in either column 1 or 2.

From clue 5, we know that filmmaking is to the left of magic-tricks. Since magic-tricks can't be in column 1 (because then there would be no room for filmmaking), it must be in column 2.

Now, from clue 3, we know that card-games is to the right of skydiving. And from clue 4, we know that skydiving is to the right of magic-tricks. Therefore, the order so far is: Magic-tricks -> Skydiving -> Card-games.

From clue 1, we know that reading is to the right of card-games. So, the final order for these four hobbies is: Magic-tricks -> Skydiving -> Card-games -> Reading.

Finally, filmmaking must be in column 5, as it's the only remaining column and hobby.

| Movie-Genre   | Sports |         |        |             |     |

From clue 1, we know the documentary movie watcher is to the right of the horror movie watcher. Let's place them in columns 3 and 4 for now:

| Movie-Genre   | Sports |         | Horror | Documentary |     |

From clue 3, we know the horror movie watcher is between the romance and documentary movie watchers. Since the documentary movie watcher is already in column 4, the romance movie watcher must be in column 2:

#############


Let me explain how I arrived at the solution:

From clue (4), we know that sports is in an odd position. Given the constraints, it can only be in position 1.

Clue (6) tells us that sports is on the left of family, which means family cannot be in position 1 or 2 (since sports is already occupying position 1). Family must be in either position 4 or 5.

Now, let's analyze the relationship between martial-arts and romance. Clues (1) and (5) indicate that romance is to the right of martial-arts. Since family is likely on the right side, we can place martial-arts on the left side of family. This means martial-arts cannot be in position 4 or 5.

Clue (3) tells us that martial-arts is between comedy and romance. Considering the current placement, martial-arts must be in position 2.

With martial-arts in position 2, clue (2) indicates that comedy is between romance and family. Given the constraints, comedy can only fit in position 3.

Finally, since family cannot be on the left side of sports (clue 6), it must be in position 5.

The remaining position 4 is occupied by romance.

Therefore, we have:


|               | Sports  | Martial-Arts | Comedy | Romance | Family |
| Movie-Genre   |        |        |        |              |         |

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 1, we know that lacrosse is to the right of ice-hockey.
From clue 3, we can ignore this clue since it doesn't provide any new information.
From clue 5, we know that snowboarding is to the right of lacrosse. Combining this with clue 2, we get: golf - skiing - snowboarding (in some order).
From clue 4, we know that snowboarding is on the right of skiing, which means the correct order for these three sports is: golf - skiing - snowboarding.
From clue 6, we know that skiing is to the left of golf. This tells us that golf cannot be in column 1, and since ice-hockey must be to the left of lacrosse (clue 1), the only possible position for ice-hockey is column 2.
Now we can fill in the remaining columns: lacrosse (column 3 or 4) and snowboarding (column 4 or 5). Since snowboarding is to the right of lacrosse (clue 5), we get: ice-hockey - lacrosse - skiing - snowboarding - golf.

This solution satisfies all the given clues."
Lv7-1x5-10	"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The owner of the horse is on the left of the owner of the dog.
This means that Horse cannot be in position 4 or 5, and Dog cannot be in position 1.

2. The owner of the snake is somewhere between the owner of the horse and the owner of the guinea-pig.
This means that Snake must be to the right of Horse and to the left of Guinea-pig.

3. The owner of the chinchilla is in the middle.
Since there are 5 positions, Chinchilla must be in position 3.

4. The owner of the guinea-pig is somewhere to the right of the owner of the snake.
This means that Guinea-pig cannot be in position 1 or 2.

Now, let's combine these clues:

* Horse and Snake are next to each other, with Snake on the right (due to clue 4).
* Chinchilla is in the middle (position 3).
* Dog must be after Horse, but before Guinea-pig.
* Guinea-pig must be at the end.

Here is the final solution table:
