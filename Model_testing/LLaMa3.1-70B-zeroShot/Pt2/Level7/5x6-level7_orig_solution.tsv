Lv7-5x6-5	"Here is the step-by-step solution to the logic puzzle:


# Step 1: Use clues 30 and 1 to determine that the journalist drinks cola.
Journalist (cola)

# Step 2: Use clue 6 to determine that the person eating cucumber is on the right of the journalist.
Journalist (cola) | Person eating cucumber

# Step 3: Use clue 3 to determine that the person who's sport is ice-hockey (journalist) is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is parkour.
Person who's sport is parkour | Journalist (cola) | Person eating cucumber

# Step 4: Use clues 9, 17, and 4 to determine that the accountant is in an odd position (1 or 3), left of the person eating orange and the person who's sport is baseball.
Accountant | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...

# Step 5: Use clue 16 to determine that the person drinking coffee is somewhere to the left of the person drinking juice.
Person drinking coffee | ... | Person drinking juice

# Step 6: Use clues 37 and 23 to determine that the person eating radish drinks coffee and is on the left of the journalist.
Person eating radish (coffee) | Journalist (cola)

# Step 7: Use clue 2 to determine that the person eating radish is on the right of the fan of classical, who must be in position 1 or 3. Since the accountant is in an odd position and left of the person eating orange, the fan of classical must be in position 1.
Fan of classical | Person eating radish (coffee) | Journalist (cola)

# Step 8: Use clue 7 to determine that the person drinking sprite is the person who's sport is sailing. Since they are on the far left or far right, and the fan of classical is in position 1, the person who's sport is sailing must be in position 6.
Fan of classical | Person eating radish (coffee) | ... | ... | ... | Person drinking sprite (sailing)

# Step 9: Use clue 8 to determine that the person eating radish is on the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing, but since they are already on the left side, this doesn't provide any new information.

# Step 10: Use clues 25 and 10 to determine that the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea, who must be in position 3 or 5. Since the fan of classical is in position 1, the person eating radish is in position 2, and the journalist is in position 4 (ice-hockey), the person drinking soy-milk and iced-tea must be in positions 3 and 5.
Fan of classical | Person eating radish (coffee) | Person drinking soy-milk | Journalist (cola) | Person drinking iced-tea | Person drinking sprite (sailing)

# Step 11: Use clue 10 to determine that the person who's sport is cycling drinks iced-tea.

# Step 12: Use clue 38 to determine that the person who's sport is parkour is somewhere to the left of the person drinking iced-tea.
Person who's sport is parkour | ... | Person drinking soy-milk | Journalist (cola) | Person drinking iced-tea

# Step 13: Use clues 18 and 28 to determine that the fan of indie is in an odd position, between the fan of dubstep and the fan of disco. Since the person who's sport is cycling drinks iced-tea and is somewhere to the right of the fan of indie (clue 18), the fan of indie must be in position 1 or 3.

# Step 14: Use clues 31 and 36 to determine that the fan of indie is on the left or right of the fan of gospel, who must be in an even position.
Fan of indie | ... | Fan of gospel

# Step 15: Combine all previous steps to get the following table:

Lv7-5x6-6	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a possible solution:


|               |     1      |     2     |      3       |      4      |     5      |      6      |
| Beverage      | 7up        | almond-milk| fanta         | cola         | mirinda    | ied-tea   |

| Transport     | airplane   | bus        | subway        | skateboard   | bike       | ship      |

Note: I used the following logic to solve the puzzle:

* Clues 1-5 helped establish some initial relationships between rows.
* Clue 6 revealed that the Egyptian is driving the subway, and clue 8 restricted the snowboarding person to an odd position (1, 3, or 5).
* Clue 10 placed the 7up drinker on either end of the table, and clues 11-13 helped narrow down possible positions for mirinda and almond-milk.
* Clues 14-18 provided additional constraints on lacrosse, cricket, and collecting.
* Clue 19 restricted the Italian to being after the cola drinker.
* Clues 20-25 helped establish relationships between hobbies (video-games, chess, gardening, etc.).
* Clues 26-32 further refined positions for snowboarding, bike, airplane, and other rows.
