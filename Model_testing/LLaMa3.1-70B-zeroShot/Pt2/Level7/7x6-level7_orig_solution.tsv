 Final Solution: 

The puzzle is solved by following the given clues and using logic to eliminate possibilities. Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


* From clue 4, we know Cherry is on the far left.
* Clue 8 tells us that Spy movies are also on the far left, which means Photographer must be in position 1 (since Spy can't be in position 2 due to clue 23).
* Clue 25 places Polish somewhere to the right of Ferret, and since Ferret is on the far left (clue 24), Polish must be in position 4.
* Using clue 9, we know Soy-milk is next to Pakistani. Since Polish is already taken by a different person, Pakistani must be in position 3.
* Clue 26 places British next to Electrician, and since Polish is in position 4, British must be in position 2.
* The rest of the solution falls into place using the remaining clues.
