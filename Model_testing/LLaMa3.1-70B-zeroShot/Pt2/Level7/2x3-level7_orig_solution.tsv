Lv7-2x3-1	"Let's analyze the clues:


Clue 1: The owner of the rat is between the drama movie watcher and the ferret owner.
This means the order is either: Drama, Rat, Ferret or Ferret, Rat, Drama


Clue 2: The bird owner is to the right of the ferret owner.


Clue 3: The mystery movie watcher is to the right of the ferret owner.


Considering all clues, we can deduce that:


* Ferret must be in position 1 (since it has to be to the left of both Bird and Mystery)
* Rat must be in position 2 (as per Clue 1)
* Drama movie watcher cannot be in position 3 (otherwise, Rat would not be between Drama and Ferret), so it must be in position 1. But we already have Ferret there! So, the order is: Ferret, Rat, Drama doesn't work.
* The only other option for the order of Drama and Rat is: Ferret, Drama is incorrect (Rat would not be between them), so it must be: Drama, Rat, Ferret


Now we can fill in the rest:


* Bird owner must be to the right of Ferret (Clue 2), which means position 3
* Mystery movie watcher must also be to the right of Ferret (Clue 3), but since Bird is already in position 3, it must be that the Mystery movie watcher is actually watching Western movies doesn't make sense... or Drama movies! That's it!


The final table looks like this:

Lv7-2x3-2	"Let's analyze the clues:


Clue 1: The person driving the subway is in an odd position.
This means the subway driver can only be in position 1 or 3.


Clue 2: The fan of country is somewhere between the fan of reggae and the person driving the tram.
This means the order must be either: Reggae, Country, Tram or Tram, Country, Reggae


Clue 3: The person driving the subway is on the far right.
This means the subway driver can only be in position 3.


Considering all clues, we get:


#############

| Music-Genre   | Reggae     | Country |        |
| Transport     | Tram       |         | Subway |

Since the country fan is between the reggae fan and the tram driver, position 2 can't be the subway. And since the person driving the van is not mentioned in any of the clues, it must occupy the empty spot.


The final solution table:

Lv7-2x3-3	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a possible solution:


|             |   1    |    2    |   3    |
| Beverage    | water  | coffee  | mirinda|
| Transport   | train  | subway  | roller |

Here's my reasoning:

From clue (2), we know that the person driving the train is on the left of the person drinking mirinda. This means that the train must be in position 1 or 2.

Clue (1) states that the person driving the subway is between the person drinking coffee and the person driving the roller. Since the subway can't be in the same position as the train (because they are different transport), it's likely that the train is on the left (position 1). If we place the train in position 2, there wouldn't be enough space to fit the subway between the coffee and roller.

Assuming the train is in position 1, I placed mirinda in position 3, as per clue (2).

With the train and mirinda positions settled, I used clue (1) again. To place the subway between the person drinking coffee and the person driving the roller, I put the subway in position 2.

This leaves us with only one option for coffee: it must be in position 3 doesn't fit, so it goes to position 2 isn't possible due to the subway, hence the remaining choice is that coffee goes into position 1's neighbor, which would be position 2. The final beverage water can then go into position 1's left neighbor (which we already filled with train). The last transport to fill was the roller and as per logic from clue (1), it should go to position 3.

The table now looks like:


#############
|             |   1    |    2    |   3    |
| Beverage    | water  | coffee  | mirinda|

Lv7-2x3-4	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table.

From clue 3, we know that the person watching time-travel movies is to the right of the person watching comedy movies. This means:

|               |     1     |        2        |      3      |
| Job           |           |                 |             |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy    |                 | Time-travel |

From clue 2, we know that the project-manager is not watching comedy movies. Therefore, the project-manager must be in either column 2 or 3.

From clue 1, we know that the project-manager is between the person watching time-travel movies and the scientist. This means that the project-manager cannot be in column 3 (since there's no one to their right), so they must be in column 2. Also, this implies that the scientist is in either column 1 or 3.

Putting it all together:

|               |     1     |        2        |      3      |
| Job           | Scientist | Project-manager | Teacher    |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy    | Time-travel     | Action     |

Wait, no! The teacher is watching action movies? That's not what we're trying to solve. We need to use the fact that there are only three jobs and three movie genres.

Let's try again:

|               |     1     |        2        |      3      |
| Job           | Teacher   | Project-manager | Scientist  |

Lv7-2x3-5	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person driving the quad-bike is between the skateboard and hip-hop.
   This means the order is: Skateboard, Quad-bike, Hip-hop (or) Hip-hop, Quad-bike, Skateboard

2. The motorbike is on the right of salsa.
   This gives us two possible positions for Salsa:
   Salsa, Motorbike, _ or _, _, Salsa, Motorbike
   Since there are only three columns, it's more likely to be the first case: Salsa, Motorbike, _

3. Hip-hop is on either side of quad-bike.
   From clue 1 and this clue, we can conclude that hip-hop must be at position 2 or 3 (to accommodate quad-bike in between).

Combining all clues:

- Skateboard cannot be with salsa (because motorbike needs to be on the right of salsa)
- Hip-hop is not with salsa (because motorbike is on the right of salsa)

So, we have two possibilities:
   Salsa, Motorbike, _
   Skateboard, Quad-bike, _

Considering hip-hop's position:
- Hip-hop cannot be at column 1 (since it needs to be between or next to quad-bike)
- So, hip-hop must be either at column 2 or 3

If we put all these together, the only solution is:
   Salsa, Quad-bike, Hip-hop
   (Skateboard cannot go with salsa; hence motorbike has to go with salsa)

Given this arrangement does not satisfy the second clue, let's re-evaluate:

- The motorbike is on the right of salsa.
   This means salsa must be at column 1 or 2.

Considering all clues together:
- Skateboard and salsa cannot be in the same column (since motorbike needs to be on the right)
- Hip-hop must be next to quad-bike

A possible arrangement could be:

Skateboard, Quad-bike, Motorbike doesn't work with Salsa.
Hip-hop is either before or after quad-bike.

However, we can satisfy all clues by putting salsa in column 2 and motorbike in column 3:
   Skateboard, Salsa, Motorbike
   (Quad-bike needs to be between skateboard and hip-hop; but given salsa's position, this isn't possible)
   
Hence the only solution left is:
   Hip-hop, Quad-bike, _

Considering all clues together:

- Skateboard cannot go with salsa or motorbike.
- Hip-hop must be next to quad-bike.

The correct arrangement that satisfies all conditions is:

| Music-Genre   | reggae    | jazz     | blues     |
| Nationality   | pakistani | japanese | colombian |

Here's how I deduced the solution:

From statement 4, we know that the fan of jazz is between the pakistani and the fan of blues. So, the order must be: pakistani, jazz, blues (or) blues, jazz, pakistani.

Statement 3 tells us that the fan of jazz is to the right of the pakistani, so the correct order is: pakistani, jazz, blues.

Now, from statement 2, we know that the japanese is to the left of the colombian. Since the colombian cannot be in position 1 (pakistani is already there), the colombian must be in position 3.

Therefore, the final solution table is:

Lv7-2x3-7	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 2, we know that skateboarding is between goat and badminton.

From clue 1, we know that skateboarding is to the right of badminton. Combining this with clue 2, we get:
badminton - skateboarding - goat (or)
goat - skateboarding - badminton

However, if we put goat on the left, it contradicts clue 3, which says that goldfish (which is not mentioned in the above combination) should be to the right of rat. Since there are only three positions, if goat is on the left, then either goldfish or rat would have to be on the same position as goat.

So, let's try putting badminton on the left:
badminton - skateboarding - goat

Now we can use clue 3: goldfish should be to the right of rat. This means that rat must be in the second column (or it wouldn't have a right neighbor). Since goldfish is already mentioned, let's put it in the third column.

The only pet left for the first column is goat doesn't fit because we've already decided that skateboarding is between badminton and goat. So, let's swap goat with rat:
badminton - (goat doesn't fit) - goldfish

Now, let's re-analyze the pets: badminton is on the left, so it can only be paired with rat or goat (because there's no space to put skateboarding in between). But if we pair badminton with goat, then where would we put rat and goldfish?

The only remaining option is:
badminton - rat - goldfish

Now that we've decided the order of pets, let's look at the sports. We know that skateboarding should be between badminton and goat, but since badminton is paired with rat, this means that skateboarding must be in the second column (or it wouldn't have a left neighbor).

So, the final solution table looks like this:

Lv7-2x3-8	"Let's break down the clues:

From clue 1, we know the person watching Western movies is either in position 1 or 3.

From clue 2, we know the person watching Mystery movies is between the person watching Western movies and the Electrician.

From clue 3, we know the person watching Sports movies is to the right of the Doctor.

Let's try to construct a solution:

Since the person watching Western movies is on the left or right of the Doctor (clue 1), and the person watching Sports movies is to the right of the Doctor (clue 3), it's likely that the Doctor is in position 2, with the person watching Western movies in position 1 and the person watching Sports movies in position 3.

Now, let's consider clue 2. The person watching Mystery movies must be between the person watching Western movies and the Electrician. If the Electrician were in position 3, this would contradict our previous deduction that the person watching Sports movies is in position 3. Therefore, the Electrician must be in position 1 or 2. But we already know the Doctor is in position 2, so the Electrician must be in position 1.

However, wait! We previously concluded that the person watching Western movies was in position 1. So, the Electrician can't be there. Let's revise our conclusion: the person watching Western movies must be in position 3, not position 1.

Here's a revised solution:

|               |      1       |    2    |      3      |
| Job           | Electrician | Doctor  | Entrepreneur|
| Movie-Genre   | Mystery     | Sports  | Western     |

But this still doesn't satisfy clue 2, which requires the person watching Mystery movies to be between the person watching Western movies and the Electrician. So, let's swap the positions of the Electrician and the Entrepreneur:

|               |      1       |    2    |      3      |
| Job           | Entrepreneur | Doctor  | Electrician|
| Movie-Genre   | Mystery     | Sports  | Western     |

Now, this doesn't quite satisfy our expectations either. After re-examining the clues, I came up with another solution:


|               |      1       |    2    |      3      |
| Job           | Entrepreneur | Electrician| Doctor   |
| Movie-Genre   | Western     | Mystery    | Sports     |

This solution satisfies all three clues:

* The person watching Western movies (Entrepreneur) is on the left of the Doctor.
* The person watching Mystery movies is between the person watching Western movies and the Electrician.
* The person watching Sports movies is to the right of the Doctor.

Here's the final solution table:

Lv7-2x3-9	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.


From clue 2, we know the manager is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing. Since there are only three columns, this means the person with the hobby ""writing"" must be in column 1 or 2.


From clue 1, we know the teacher is not the person who's hobby is writing. This doesn't give us a direct placement, but it helps to rule out possibilities later on.


From clue 3, we know the doctor is between the manager and the person with the hobby ""filmmaking"". Since the manager is on the right of the person with the hobby ""writing"", this means the person with the hobby ""filmmaking"" must be in column 1 (because there's no space to the left of the manager for another person). The doctor, therefore, cannot be in column 3 because they have to be between the manager and the filmmaker. This leaves us with two possible placements for the doctor: either between the manager and the filmmaker (in columns 2-3) or as the manager themselves.


Now let's piece together what we know:


- Column 1 must contain a person whose hobby is filmmaking.
- The manager cannot be in column 1 (because they have to be on the right of the writer), so the manager must be either in column 2 or 3.
- The doctor has to be between the manager and the filmmaker, but since the filmmaker is already in column 1, this means the doctor cannot be the person in column 1. Therefore, the doctor must be in column 2 because they need to be between the manager (who can only fit in column 3 if the writer is in column 2) and the filmmaker.
- Given that the teacher isn't the writer (from clue 1), and considering the placements we have for the jobs and hobbies, the teacher must then fit into whatever remaining job slot exists.


Here's a possible arrangement:


|         |     1      |    2    |    3    |
| Hobby   | Filmmaking | Writing | Chess   |
| Job     |            | Doctor  | Manager |


However, we know the teacher isn't the writer (clue 1), and since all slots are filled with jobs except for one hobby-job pair left without a job specified in our logic so far (which has to be writing because filmmaking and chess were assigned based on the clues directly or indirectly), this leaves us figuring out where the teacher fits among these three. Since we have ""filmmaking"" assigned, ""writing"" must take its place with one of the other hobbies based on previous clue interpretations:


If the writer can't be in column 3 (because the manager has to be there, as per clue 2), and considering all job placements relative to each hobby now, let's try assigning the teacher to chess directly since writing is the hobby that needs a corresponding job:


|         |     1      |    2    |    3    |
| Hobby   | Filmmaking | Writing | Chess   |
| Job     | Teacher    | Doctor  | Manager |


This arrangement seems to fit all given clues without contradiction. It places the manager on the right of the person with the hobby ""writing"", keeps the doctor between the manager and the filmmaker, and avoids making the teacher someone whose hobby is writing.


So, here's our solution table:


#############
|         |     1      |    2    |    3    |
| Hobby   | Filmmaking | Writing | Chess   |

1. The person drinking coffee is on the right of the person drinking Sprite.
This means that Sprite must be in either column 1 or 2, and Coffee must be in a column to the right of it.

2. The person who's sport is tennis is the person drinking milk.
So, we can fill in ""Tennis"" under ""Sport"" for the person drinking milk.

3. The person drinking Sprite is somewhere between the person drinking milk and the person who's sport is skiing.
This means that Milk must be on one side of Sprite, and Skiing on the other.

Now, let's try to combine these clues:

If we put Milk in column 1, then Sprite must be in column 2 (to satisfy clue 3), and Coffee in column 3. But this would mean that Coffee is not to the right of Sprite, which contradicts clue 1.

So, let's try putting Milk in column 2. Then Sprite can go in either column 1 or 3, but since it needs to be between Milk and Skiing (clue 3), it must go in column 1. This means Coffee goes in column 3.

Here's the final solution:
