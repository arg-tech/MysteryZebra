Now, let's fill in the food column. From clue 2, I know the person eating tomato is between the person eating kiwi and the Australian.


Since the Australian is already in position 1, I'll place the kiwi in position 3.

Lv7-3x3-2	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:

## Solution:

| Beverage      | lemonade  | sprite     | coffee    |
| Music-Genre   | soul      | electronic | house     |
| Transport     | subway    | helicopter | scooter   |

Justification:

* From clue 2, the fan of soul is on the far left.
* From clue 5, the fan of electronic is between the person driving the helicopter and the person drinking lemonade. This means lemonade cannot be in position 3 (since it would not be to the right of electronic). So lemonade must be in position 1 or 2. But from clue 3, sprite is to the left of electronic, so lemonade must be in position 1.
* From clue 4 (which seems redundant), the person driving the subway is indeed driving the subway. Given that lemonade is already assigned to position 1, and soul is also in position 1, subway must be the transport mode for this person.
* The fan of house drives the scooter (clue 1). Since electronic cannot be with the helicopter (due to clue 5), house must be paired with the scooter. Given the remaining options, house can only fit in position 3.
* This leaves positions 2 and 3 for electronic and coffee. But since lemonade is already assigned to position 1, electronic must be in position 2 (to satisfy clue 5).
* Therefore, sprite is left for position 2's beverage.

Lv7-3x3-3	"Based on the clues, I'll try to solve the puzzle.


From clue 3, we know the Indian is on the far right, so:


|               |     1     |   2    |     3     |
| Beverage      |           |        |           |

| Nationality   |           |        | Indian    |

From clue 2, we know the Colombian is in an odd position. Since there are only three positions, this means the Colombian must be either in position 1 or 3. But since the Indian is already in position 3, the Colombian must be in position 1:


|               |     1     |   2    |     3     |
| Beverage      |           |        |           |
| Movie-Genre   |           |        |           |
| Nationality   | Colombian |        | Indian    |

From clue 5, we know the person drinking coffee is on the left of the German. Since the Colombian is already in position 1, this means the person drinking coffee must be the Colombian:


|               |     1     |   2    |     3     |
| Beverage      | Coffee    |        |           |
| Movie-Genre   |           |        |           |
| Nationality   | Colombian |        | Indian    |

From clue 4, we know the person drinking milk is between the person watching romance movies and the person watching superhero movies. This means the person watching romance movies must be in position 1 (since the person drinking coffee is already there), and the person watching superhero movies must be in position 3 (since the Indian is already there). The person watching satire movies must then be in position 2:


|               |     1     |   2    |     3     |
| Beverage      | Coffee    |        |           |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance   | Satire | Superhero |
| Nationality   | Colombian |        | Indian    |

The only beverage left is Fanta, which must be in position 2:


|               |     1     |   2    |     3     |

| Movie-Genre   | Romance   | Satire | Superhero |
| Nationality   | Colombian |        | Indian    |

From clue 4 again, we know the person drinking milk is between the person watching romance movies and the person watching superhero movies. This means the person drinking milk must be in position 2 or 3. But since Fanta is already in position 2, the person drinking milk must be in position 3:


|               |     1     |   2    |     3     |
| Beverage      | Coffee    | Fanta  | Milk      |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance   | Satire | Superhero |

|# Beverage      | mirinda   | juice      | 7up       |
|# Job           | scientist | designer   | librarian |
|# Music-Genre   | d&b       | electronic | rock      |

To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues:

1. The person drinking juice is to the left of the fan of electronic music.
This means that the person who drinks juice cannot be in column 3.

2. The fan of rock music is on the far right.
This means that column 3 must have ""rock"" as its Music-Genre.

3. The person drinking mirinda is to the left of the designer.
Since there are only three columns, this means that mirinda can only be in column 1 (because if it were in column 2, the designer would have to be in a non-existent column 4).

4. The scientist is between the fan of rock and the fan of d&b.
Given clue 2, we know rock is on the far right. This means that the scientist must be in either column 1 or 2 (because they need to be to the left of rock). However, from clue 3, mirinda's position requires the designer to be in column 2, which means the scientist cannot be there. Therefore, the scientist is in column 1.

The only remaining job is librarian, and it must go with the person who drinks 7up (the only remaining beverage), as per clue 4.

So far, we have:
|               |     1     |     2      |    3     |
| Beverage      | mirinda   |            |          |
| Job           | scientist | designer   |          |
| Music-Genre   |            | electronic | rock     |

From clue 4 again, since the scientist is in column 1 and needs to be between the fan of rock and d&b, it means that d&b must be in column 1. Thus, the only person left who drinks juice (and therefore can't drink mirinda or 7up) has electronic music as their genre.

So we get:
|               |     1     |     2      |    3     |
| Beverage      | mirinda   | juice      |          |
| Job           | scientist | designer   |          |
| Music-Genre   | d&b       | electronic | rock     |

Finally, the only person left is the one who drinks 7up and must be a librarian (since we know the other two jobs), resulting in the final table:

#|               |     1     |     2      |    3     |
|# Beverage      | mirinda   | juice      | 7up       |
|# Job           | scientist | designer   | librarian |
|# Music-Genre   | d&b       | electronic | rock      |

Lv7-3x3-5	"Let's break down the clues:

From clue 3, we know the order of transport is: Train, Ship, Van.

From clue 1, we know the person driving the train is on the left of the person driving the ship, so the order is indeed: Train, Ship, Van.

Now, let's analyze the other clues:

From clue 2, we know the owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the fan of house. This means House cannot be in column 3 (since there would be no one to its right).

From clue 4, we know the fan of disco is between the fan of house and the owner of the goldfish.

Considering these clues together, let's try to fill out the table:


|               |   1   |     2      |    3     |
| Music-Genre   |       |            |          |

| Transport     | Train | Ship       | Van      |

Now, let's place House in column 1 (since it can't be in column 3), and Disco between House and the goldfish:


|               |   1   |     2      |    3     |
| Music-Genre   | House | Disco      | Ambient  |
| Pet           |       |            |          |
| Transport     | Train | Ship       | Van      |

The owner of the guinea-pig must be on the right of the fan of house, so it goes in column 2 or 3. But if it's in column 2, there would be no room for Disco between House and the goldfish (clue 4). Therefore, the guinea-pig is in column 3:


|               |   1   |     2      |    3     |
| Music-Genre   | House | Disco      | Ambient  |
| Pet           |       |            | Guinea-pig|
| Transport     | Train | Ship       | Van      |

Finally, the goldfish must be in column 2 (since it's between House and Disco), and the snake is left for column 1:


|               |   1   |     2      |    3     |
| Music-Genre   | House | Disco      | Ambient  |
| Pet           | Snake | Goldfish   | Guinea-pig|
| Transport     | Train | Ship       | Van      |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 4, the librarian is between the Turkish and Japanese people. From clue 1, the librarian is also to the left of the software developer.


Combining these two clues, we get: Turkish - Librarian - Japanese (in some order) and Software Developer on the rightmost column.


Clue 2 tells us that Iced-tea is to the right of Water. Clue 3 tells us that Japanese is to the right of Iced-tea.


So, we have: ... - Water - Iced-tea - Japanese


Now, combining all these clues, we get:


Turkish - Musician (since Librarian is between Turkish and Japanese) - Librarian (drinking Iced-tea) - Japanese (drinking Juice)


And the Software Developer on the rightmost column drinks Water.


Putting it all together, we get the above solution table:

#| Transport   | bike        | trike        | bus          |#

Here's the explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue (2), we know that the doctor is to the right of the entrepreneur, so the entrepreneur must be in column 1 and the doctor in either column 2 or 3.

Clue (5) tells us that the person drinking iced-tea is on the far left or far right. Since water cannot be on the far right (because of clue (6)), we can conclude that water is in column 1, which means iced-tea must be in column 3.

Now, from clue (4), we know that hot-chocolate is driven by a trike. Clue (7) tells us that this person is between the bus and bike riders. This means that hot-chocolate cannot be in column 1 or 3, so it must be in column 2. 

From clue (3), we know that the bus rider is on the far right, which confirms our previous conclusion.

Clue (6) tells us that iced-tea is to the right of water, which means that the order of beverages from left to right is: water, hot-chocolate, and then iced-tea.

Since clue (1) states that the police-officer is to the right of the doctor, we know that the doctor cannot be in column 2. So the job list must go from left to right as follows: entrepreneur, police-officer, doctor.

Therefore, our solution table is:


#|             |      1       |       2       |       3        |

| Transport     | Train     | Motorbike| Airplane|

 

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took:

From clue 4, we know the Dutch person drives an airplane, so they must be in column 3.
From clue 5, the Polish person is between the airplane and the bird. Since the airplane is in column 3, the Polish person must be in column 1.
Clue 2 states that the rabbit owner is to the right of the motorbike driver. This means the motorbike driver cannot be in column 3 (as there's no one to their right), so they must be in either column 1 or 2. But if they were in column 1, the Polish person would have to be driving a motorbike, which contradicts clue 5. Therefore, the motorbike driver is in column 2.
Now, from clue 1, we know the train driver is between the British and airplane drivers. Since the Dutch (airplane) are in column 3, the train driver must be in column 1 (to be to the left of the British), which means they're also Polish.
The only remaining pet is the bird, which belongs to the person driving a motorbike, i.e., the British (column 2).
Lastly, since the snake's owner drives an airplane (clue 3), and we already know the Dutch drive an airplane, this confirms our solution.

Lv7-3x3-9	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a possible solution:

| Beverage    | juice | almond-milk | milk    |
| Sport       | golf  | ice-hockey | biathlon|
| Transport   | scooter| bike        | jet-ski |

Here's my reasoning:

From clue 4, the person drinking juice is to the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since there are only three positions, this means that juice must be in position 1.

From clue 3, the person drinking almond-milk is to the right of the person driving the bike. This means that almond-milk cannot be in position 1 (since bike would have to be to its left). Therefore, almond-milk must be in position 2 or 3. But since milk is in an odd position (clue 1), and almond-milk can't be in position 1, it must be in position 2.

From clue 2, the person who's sport is ice-hockey is between the person driving the scooter and the person who's sport is golf. This means that ice-hockey cannot be in position 1 (since scooter would have to be to its left), so it must be in position 2 or 3.

Considering all these constraints, I placed biathlon (the only remaining sport) in position 3, with milk as the beverage and jet-ski as the transport. Golf goes to position 1, with juice as the beverage and scooter as the transport.

| Beverage      | soy-milk | cola    | milk       |
| Movie-Genre   | western  | thriller| drama       |
| Nationality   | turkish  | russian | australian |

Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 4, we know the person watching thriller movies is the Russian.

Clue 5 states that the Australian is on the right of the person watching thriller movies. Since there are only three positions, this means the Russian (thriller) must be in position 2, and the Australian must be in position 3.

Now, let's look at clue 2: ""the russian is somewhere between the person drinking soy-milk and the australian"". This implies that the person drinking soy-milk cannot be on the right side of the Russian. Therefore, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 1.

Clue 3 states that the person drinking milk is on the right of the person watching western movies. Given the current arrangement, this means the person watching western movies must be in position 1 (since milk cannot be in position 1), and the person drinking milk must be in position 3 or 2. However, since the Australian (position 3) is not drinking milk (according to clue 5), the person drinking milk must be in position 3, but this contradicts our earlier conclusion that the person watching western movies is in position 1 and milk is on their right. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate.
