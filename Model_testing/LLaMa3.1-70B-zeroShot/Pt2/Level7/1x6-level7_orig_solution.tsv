Lv7-1x6-1	"Based on the given clues, I will solve the logic puzzle:


From clue 4, we know that jazz is to the left of R&B.


From clue 5, we know that R&B is to the left of classical. Combining this with the previous statement, we get: jazz -> R&B -> classical


From clue 1, we know that folk is to the left of jazz. So now we have: folk -> jazz -> R&B -> classical


From clue 3, we know that folk is between country and classical. Since folk is already to the left of jazz (which is to the left of classical), country must be to the right of folk but still to the left of classical.


From clue 2, we know that country is between classical and metal. Combining this with the previous statements, we get: folk -> country -> jazz -> R&B -> classical -> metal


Now, let's fill in the table:

Lv7-1x6-2	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.


From clue 3, we know the owner of the lizard is in an even position. This means the lizard can be in position 2, 4, or 6.

From clue 1 and 4, we know the owner of the hedgehog is between the owner of the goat and the pony, and the goat is to the right of the hedgehog. This means the order must be: hedgehog, goat, pony.

From clue 2, we know the owner of the goat is on the left or right of the owner of the guinea-pig.

Combining these clues, we can start filling in the table:


|       |  1   |    2     |  3   |     4      |    5    |   6    |
| Pet   |      |          |      |            |         |        |

Let's place the lizard in position 2, and the hedgehog in position 1:


|       |  1   |    2     |  3   |     4      |    5    |   6    |
| Pet   | hog  | lizard  |      |            |         |        |

Now, we can place the goat and pony:


|       |  1   |    2     |  3   |     4      |    5    |   6    |
| Pet   | hog  | lizard  | goat |            | pony    |        |

From clue 5, we know the owner of the hamster is between the owner of the lizard and the guinea-pig. This means the guinea-pig must be in position 3 or 5.


Since the goat is already in an odd position (clue 6), we can place the guinea-pig in position 5:


|       |  1   |    2     |  3   |     4      |    5    |   6    |
| Pet   | hog  | lizard  |      |            | guinea- | pony    |

Finally, we can place the hamster in position 3:


|       |  1   |    2     |  3   |     4      |    5    |   6    |
| Pet   | hog  | lizard  | ham  |            | guinea- | pony    |

The final solution is:

Lv7-1x6-3	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|       |  1   |    2     |  3   |     4      |  5   |  6  |
| Pet   | Bird | Goldfish | Frog | Chinchilla | Rat  | Goat |

Here's how I deduced the solution:

* From clue 3, we know the owner of the bird is on the left of the owner of the goldfish, so they can be in positions 1 and 2.
* From clue 2, we know the owner of the frog is on the right of the owner of the goldfish, so the frog must be in position 3.
* From clue 4, we know the owner of the frog is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla, so the chinchilla must be in position 4 or later. But since the goat needs to be between the rat and the chinchilla (clue 5), the chinchilla can't be too far away from the frog. So, let's put the chinchilla in position 4.
* From clue 1, we know the owner of the rat is somewhere to the right of the owner of the frog, so the rat must be in position 5 or later.
* Finally, the goat needs to be between the rat and the chinchilla (clue 5), so it can only fit in position 6.

Here's the final solution with '#############' around it:

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 4, we know the fan of dubstep is on the far left, so it goes in position 1.
* From clue 3, we know the fan of salsa is to the right of the fan of dubstep, so it goes in position 2.
* From clue 1, we know the fan of electronic is to the left of the fan of indie. We also know from clue 2 that the fan of indie is to the left of the fan of techno.
* Since the fan of techno is between the fan of classical and indie (clue 5), and the fan of indie is already placed, we can deduce that the fan of techno must be in position 5, with the fan of electronic and indie before it.
* This leaves position 3 for the fan of electronic and position 4 for the fan of indie.
* The only remaining genre is classical, which goes in the last available spot, position 6."
Lv7-1x6-5	"Let's break down the clues step by step:

From clue 1, we know that the Mexican is between the Argentine and the Polish.

From clue 3, we know that the Argentine is on the right of the Mexican, so the order is: ...-Mexican-Argentine...

From clue 6, we know that the Polish is on the right of the Thai.

From clue 2, we know that the Thai is between the Polish and the Canadian. Since the Polish is already to the right of the Thai (from clue 6), the order must be: ...-Thai-Polish...

Combining these two sequences, we get: ...-Mexican-Argentine...-Thai-Polish-Canadian

From clue 4, we know that the Spanish is somewhere to the right of the Canadian.

From clue 5, we know that the Spanish is on the right of the Canadian, so the order is: ...-Canadian-Spanish

Combining all these sequences, we get:

#############

#############

 Wait, no! The Mexican is between the Argentine and the Polish (clue 1), so it can't be in position 5.

And clue 7 says that the Mexican is to the right of the Polish##5. This means the Mexican must be in position 6, not 5.

So, let's try again:

From clue 1 and 2, we know spy is to the left of martial-arts, and between martial-arts and documentary. Since martial-arts is on the far right, spy must be in position 5:

|               |    1    |   2    |   3   |      4      |  5  |      6       |
| Movie-Genre   |         |        |       |             | spy |  martial-arts|

From clue 2, we know documentary is not in position 6 (martial-arts), so it must be to the left of spy. Let's put it in position 4 for now:

|               |    1    |   2    |   3   |      4      |  5  |      6       |
| Movie-Genre   |         |        |       | documentary | spy |  martial-arts|

From clue 5 and 6, we know crime is to the left of documentary, so let's put it in position 3:

|               |    1    |   2    |   3   |      4      |  5  |      6       |
| Movie-Genre   |         |        | crime | documentary | spy |  martial-arts|

From clue 7, we know horror is between crime and romance. Let's put romance in position 1 for now:

|               |    1    |   2    |   3   |      4      |  5  |      6       |
| Movie-Genre   | romance |        | crime | documentary | spy |  martial-arts|

Now, horror must be in position 2, between crime and romance:

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:


* From clue 2, we know skydiving is between rock-climbing and dancing.
* From clue 3, we know skydiving is to the right of dancing.
* Combining these two clues, we can deduce that rock-climbing must be to the left of dancing.
* From clue 5, we know reading is to the right of rock-climbing. Since chess is also to the right of rock-climbing (clue 4), and gardening is to the right of chess (clue 1), we can start building a sequence: R.C., Reading, Chess, Gardening.
* Finally, since skydiving is between rock-climbing and dancing (and actually to the right of dancing), and dancing must be at position 5, we can fill in the last two positions.

Lv7-1x6-8	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:


From clue 4, we know the lawyer is on the far right, so the table looks like this:

|       |     1     |    2     |   3    |     4     |     5     |   6    |
| Job   |           |          |        |           |           | Lawyer |

From clue 6, we know the lawyer is on the right of the architect, so the architect must be in one of the first five positions. We also know that the librarian is on the left or right of the architect (clue 5), and since the doctor is between the librarian and the scientist (clue 1), the architect cannot be in position 1.

Let's try placing the architect in position 3:

|       |     1     |    2     | Architect|           |           | Lawyer |

Now, from clue 5, we know the librarian is on the left or right of the architect. If the librarian is to the left of the architect, then the doctor must be between the librarian and the scientist (clue 1), but this would mean the scientist is in position 2, which contradicts clue 2 (the scientist is somewhere to the left of the mechanic).

So, the librarian must be to the right of the architect:

|       |     1     |    2     | Architect| Librarian|           | Lawyer |

From clue 3, we know the doctor is on the left of the librarian, so the doctor must be in position 2 or earlier. But if the doctor is in position 2, then the scientist would have to be in position 1 (to satisfy clue 1), which means there's no room for the mechanic (clue 2).

So, the doctor must be in position 1:

|       | Doctor    |    2     | Architect| Librarian|           | Lawyer |

Now, from clue 1, we know the scientist is to the right of the doctor and to the left of the mechanic. The only place that satisfies this is if the scientist is in position 5:

|       | Doctor    | Scientist| Architect| Librarian| Mechanic | Lawyer |

But wait, this doesn't satisfy clue 2! We need to swap the positions of the scientist and the librarian:


|       | Doctor    |    2     | Architect|           | Scientist| Lawyer |

Then, from clue 5, we can fill in the remaining spot with the mechanic's opponent - no, just kidding!


The correct table is:


|       | Doctor    |    2     | Architect| Librarian| Scientist| Lawyer |

And finally, from clue 2, we know the scientist is to the left of the mechanic. We also know that the architect and librarian are already in positions 3 and 4. So, the only place for the mechanic is position 5:


|       | Doctor    | Scientist| Architect| Librarian| Mechanic | Lawyer |

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

From clue 8, strawberry is on the left of cucumber.

From clue 2, strawberry is to the left of apricot. Combining this with the previous conclusion, we get: strawberry, ?, apricot, cucumber

From clue 4, strawberry is between apricot and lemon. This means lemon must be after apricot. We also know that strawberry is before apricot.

From clue 6, apricot is to the left of blueberry. So, apricot can't be in position 5 or 6 (since there wouldn't be enough space for blueberry). Let's assume apricot is in position 4.

Now we have: strawberry, ?, ?, apricot, cucumber, ?

From clue 7, cranberry is to the left of lemon. Since strawberry and apricot are already taken, let's put cranberry in position 2. Then, lemon must be after cranberry (but not necessarily directly next).

We now have: strawberry, cranberry, ?, apricot, cucumber, ?

From clue 1, apricot is to the right of cranberry, which we've already satisfied.

Let's fill in the remaining blanks:

* Position 3 can't be blueberry (since apricot must be before it), so let's put lemon there.
* The only remaining food is blueberry, which goes after apricot.

The final solution is:


|        |     1     |   2   |     3      |    4     |    5    |     6     |
