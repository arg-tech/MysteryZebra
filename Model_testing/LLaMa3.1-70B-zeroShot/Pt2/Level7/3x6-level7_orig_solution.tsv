From clue 9, the person watching sports movies is in an even position. From clue 12, the person watching action movies is on the left or right of the person watching sports movies.


|               |     1      |   2    |    3     |      4      |    5     |     6     |

From clue 4, the person who's sport is rugby is somewhere between the person watching sports movies and the person driving the motorbike.


|               |     1      |   2    |    3     |      4      |    5     |     6     |

Lv7-3x6-2	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:

|               |      country |         soul        |    reggae  |       indie     |    jazz     |       rock      |
| Beverage      |      lemonade|          coffee     |    water   |       7up       |   almond-milk|       fanta     |
| Job           |  dressmaker |       freelancer    | security-guard|    police-officer| software-developer|       mechanic  |

Let me explain the reasoning behind this solution:


From clue 4, we know that the fan of country is on the far left. Clue 1 tells us that the person drinking coffee is on the left or right of the fan of reggae. Since the fan of soul is to the left of the person drinking 7up (clue 6), and the fan of soul drinks coffee (clue 8), we can deduce that the fan of country is in position 1, followed by the fan of soul (coffee) in position 2.


Clue 3 tells us that the person drinking water is somewhere to the right of the freelancer. Clue 15 states that the freelancer is to the right of the software-developer, so we can place the freelancer in an odd position (clue 7). Since the fan of country is already in position 1, we can place the freelancer in position 3.


Clue 10 tells us that the person drinking almond-milk is to the left of the software-developer. Clue 15 states that the freelancer is to the right of the software-developer, so we can deduce that the software-developer must be in an even position (position 5).


Now, let's analyze clue 12: ""the dressmaker is somewhere between the person drinking lemonade and the security-guard"". We know that the fan of country drinks lemonade (since it's on the far left). Clue 16 states that the police-officer is to the left of the dressmaker. Since the police-officer is in position 4, we can place the dressmaker in position 1 or 2. However, since the fan of soul (coffee) is already in position 2, we must place the dressmaker in position 1, and the person drinking lemonade must be in a different position.


From clue 9, we know that the police-officer is the fan of indie. Clue 13 states that the police-officer is to the right of the person drinking 7up. We can deduce that the person drinking 7up must be in an odd position (clue 2), so it's either in position 1 or 3. However, since the fan of country is already in position 1, we must place the person drinking 7up in position 3.


Now, let's analyze clue 14: ""the person drinking water is somewhere to the right of the fan of jazz"". We know that the freelancer is in an odd position (clue 7), and it's to the right of the software-developer (clue 15). The fan of soul (coffee) is already in position 2, so we can deduce that the person drinking water must be in a position greater than 3. Since the person drinking almond-milk is to the left of the software-developer (clue 10), and the software-developer is in an even position (position 5), we can place the fan of jazz in position 4 or 6.


From clue 11, we know that the person drinking coffee is not the fan of country. We already placed the fan of soul (coffee) in position 2. Clue 1 states that the person drinking coffee is on the left or right of the fan of reggae. Since the fan of jazz must be to the left of the person drinking water, we can deduce that the fan of jazz cannot be in position 4 (since it would be between the fan of indie and the person drinking 7up). Therefore, the fan of jazz must be in position 6.


We can now fill in the remaining positions:


The fan of reggae is in position 3, since it's on the left or right of the person drinking coffee (clue 1).


The person drinking fanta is in position 6, since the person drinking coffee is to the left of the person drinking fanta (clue 5).


The security-guard is in position 3, since the dressmaker is between the person drinking lemonade and the security-guard (clue 12), and the person drinking lemonade cannot be in position 1 (since it's already occupied by the fan of country).


Finally, we can fill in the remaining job: the mechanic.


The final solution table is:

| Nationality   | italian | spanish  |     german    |    dutch   | nigerian    |  canadian   |

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

1. From clue 3, we know that the person who likes writing is to the left of the person who drinks juice.
2. From clue 16, we know that the person who likes writing is also to the left of the person who drinks almond-milk.
3. Combining these two clues, we can place the person who likes writing in position 1 or 2. Let's assume it's position 1 for now.
4. From clue 11, we know that the person who drinks coffee is between the German and the person who drinks milk.
5. From clue 17, we know that the German is in an even position (2 or 4). If the German were in position 2, then the person who drinks coffee would be in position 1, but this contradicts our earlier assumption that the person who likes writing is in position 1. Therefore, the German must be in position 4.
6. Now we can place the person who drinks coffee in position 2 and the person who drinks milk in position 3 (since it's to the right of the person who drinks coffee).
7. From clue 5, we know that the Canadian is on the left or right of the person who likes rock-climbing.
8. Since the German is already in an even position (4), the Canadian must be on the left of the person who likes rock-climbing.
9. The only remaining spot for the Canadian is position 6, and this means that the person who drinks fanta is also in position 6 (clue 7).
10. We can now fill in the remaining positions:
	* The person who likes dancing (Canadian) goes in position 6.
	* The person who likes video-games goes in position 5 (since it's to the right of the German, clue 14).
	* The Nigerian goes in position 5 (since it's not the person who drinks juice, clue 13, and not the Dutch, clue 10).

Lv7-3x6-8	"After analyzing the clues, I've constructed the following solution:

| Music-Genre   | house    | funk       | rock   | electronic| soul     | d&b        |
| Nationality   | french   | american   | russian| canadian  | australian| indonesian|

 
Note that I've placed the genres, music styles, and nationalities according to the clues provided.

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took:

* Started by placing the fan of house on the far left (clue 16) and the fan of d&b on the far right (clue 8).
* Placed the person watching epic movies between the person watching sports movies and the person watching superhero movies (clue 15). Since the indonesian is on the right of the person watching epic movies (clue 11), I placed them in positions 2-5.
* Used clue 10 to place the fan of funk with the person watching epic movies, which is position 2. Then, used clue 4 to place the american between the russian and the indonesian (positions 3-5).
* Placed the canadian somewhere between the fan of d&b and the french (clue 13), but not as the fan of electronic (clue 17). This placed them in position 4.
* Used clue 9 to place the person watching sports movies on the right of the person watching fantasy movies. Since the person watching fantasy movies is in an odd position (clue 20), I placed them in position 1.
* Placed the person watching musical movies on the left or right of the fan of d&b (clue 6). This placed them in position 5, as they can't be next to the fan of d&b directly."
Lv7-3x6-9	"After analyzing all 21 clues, I've constructed the final solution:


|            |       1       |   2    |       3        |    4     |    5    |     6      |
| Beverage   | hot-cho    te | lemona |         iced-te | sprite  | cola    | juice    |
| Food       | mango      | aprico | orange    | peach    | pumpkin  | apple    |
| Job        | engineer   | security-guard | dressmaker | teacher  | dancer  | mechanic  |

Here's how the clues were used to arrive at this solution:


Clue 1 and Clue 9 indicate that the person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the dressmaker. Since the dressmaker can't be in position 1 (due to Clue 16), sprite must be in position 4, and the dressmaker in position 3.


Clue 14 tells us that the person drinking sprite is the teacher, so the teacher is now in position 4.


Clue 18 places the person drinking iced-tea between the person eating orange (in position 3) and the dancer. Clue 17 puts lemonade between sprite and iced-tea. Therefore, lemonade must be in position 2, and iced-tea in position 5 is not possible due to the cola constraint (Clue 3), so it's in position 6.


The engineer drinks hot-chocolate (Clue 11). Clues 16 and 19 indicate that mango is on either side of the engineer or security-guard. Mango can't be in position 2 (due to Clue 21), so it must be in position 1, making the engineer's position clear.


The mechanic can't drink sprite (Clue 6), and since the teacher drinks sprite, the mechanic must be in position 6. This means the person drinking cola is somewhere between the person eating apple (position unknown) and the mechanic.


With lemonade now occupying position 2, apricot becomes a possibility for food in position 2.


The security-guard can't be in positions 1 or 3 (due to Clue 19), so it's in position 2. However, since mango is already in position 1, and due to the proximity of mango and pumpkin (Clues 12 and 21), the correct order for food becomes clear.


Orange must be on the left side of the teacher (position 3). Dancer is now the only remaining job that can fit into position 5. Cola's position is determined by Clue 7, which states it should be to the left of juice, making cola's final position clear.


Finally, apple occupies the last available food slot.


The puzzle has been solved!

Lv7-3x6-10	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with the solution:


|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |     4     |     5      |      6       |

| Sport         | Tennis    | Handball  | Cycling  | Sailing   | Golf        | Biathlon     |


Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* Clue 6 helped me place ""Adventure"" and ""Handball"" together.
* Clue 12 placed ""Tennis"" between ""Adventure"" and ""Animation"", so I put it in position 1, as it's an even number (clue 16).
* Clue 4 indicated that ""Horror"" is to the right of ""Adventure"".
* Clue 8 helped me place ""Drama"" to the left of ""Handball"".
* Clue 5 placed ""Colombian"" to the left of ""Drama"", and clue 3 put it to the right of ""Canadian"".
* Clues 7, 9, and 17 helped me place the remaining nationalities.
* Clue 15 indicated that ""Animation"" is to the left of ""Golf"", so I placed it in position 1.
* The remaining sports were placed based on clues 2, 13, and 14.

Please let me know if this solution is correct!
