Lv7-1x7-1	"Based on the given clues, I will try to solve the logic puzzle.


From clue 1, we know that the fan of techno is in the middle. Since there are an odd number of positions (7), the middle position must be position 4.


|               |  1  |   2    |    3    |   4    |    5    |     6     |  7   |
| Music-Genre   |     |        |         | Techno |         |           |      |

From clue 2, we know that the fan of ambient is on the left or right of the fan of techno. This means the fan of ambient can be in position 3 or 5.


|               |  1  |   2    |    ?    | Techno |    ?    |           |      |
| Music-Genre   |     |        |         |        |         |           |      |

From clue 6, we know that the fan of ambient is on the left of the fan of classical. This means the fan of ambient cannot be in position 5 (because then it would not be to the left of classical). Therefore, the fan of ambient must be in position 3.


|               |  1  |   2    | Ambient | Techno |         |           |      |
| Music-Genre   |     |        |         |        |         |           |      |

From clue 4, we know that the fan of classical is somewhere to the right of the fan of ambient. Since the fan of ambient is in position 3, the fan of classical must be in a position to its right. The only available positions are 5 or 6.


|               |  1  |   2    | Ambient | Techno | ?       |           |      |
| Music-Genre   |     |        |         |        | Classical?|           |      |

From clue 3, we know that the fan of dubstep is somewhere between the fan of reggae and the fan of techno. Since the fan of techno is in position 4, this means the fan of dubstep must be in either position 2 or 6 (because it needs to be between reggae and techno).


|               |  1  | Dubstep?| Ambient | Techno | Classical?| Dubstep? |      |
| Music-Genre   |     |        |         |        |           |           |      |

From clue 5, we know that the fan of r&b is on the left of the fan of reggae. This means the fan of r&b must be in a position to the left of reggae.


|               | R&B? | Dubstep?| Ambient | Techno | Classical?| Dubstep? | Reggae?|
| Music-Genre   |     |        |         |        |           |           |      |

Now, let's try to put all the pieces together!


Considering all the clues, one possible solution is:


|               | R&B  | Punk    | Ambient | Techno | Classical | Dubstep | Reggae |
| Music-Genre   |     |        |         |        |           |           |      |

This solution satisfies all the given clues.


The final answer is:

|# Action      #| Western#| Martial-Arts#| Time-Travel#| Scientific#| Thriller#| Fantasy#|

Here's a brief explanation of the steps:

* From clues 2 and 9, we know that Western is on the leftmost side (1), followed by Martial-Arts.
* Clue 6 tells us that Martial-Arts is to the left of Thriller.
* Clue 3 tells us that Fantasy is on either side of Thriller. Since Thriller can't be next to Western, it must be next to Fantasy.
* Clue 5 places Scientific between Action and Thriller. With Time-Travel also being close to Scientific (clue 8), we deduce that Time-Travel comes before Scientific.
* Finally, clue 4 puts Action on the rightmost side of Scientific.

The solution satisfies all the given clues.

Lv7-1x7-3	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 3, the person driving the trike is to the left of the person driving the train.
From clue 4, the person driving the trike is between the person driving the van and the person driving the car.

So, we can start by placing the van, trike, and car in order:

|             |  1  |   2   |   3    |
| Transport   | Van | Trike | Car |

From clue 1, the person driving the helicopter is between the person driving the car and the person driving the train.

So, we can place the helicopter to the right of the car:

|             |  1  |   2   |   3    |   4   |
| Transport   | Van | Trike | Car | Helicopter |

From clue 5, the person driving the helicopter is to the right of the person driving the train.

So, we can place the train to the left of the helicopter:

|             |  1  |   2   |   3    |   4   |   5   |
| Transport   | Van | Trike | Car | Train | Helicopter |

From clue 6, the person driving the roller is between the person driving the helicopter and the person driving the trike.

So, we can place the roller to the right of the trike:

|             |  1  |   2   |   3    |   4   |   5   |   6   |
| Transport   | Van | Trike | Roller | Car | Train | Helicopter |

Finally, from clue 8, the person driving the snowmobile is on the far right.

So, we can place the snowmobile at position 7:

#############
|             |  1  |   2   |   3    |   4   |   5   |   6   |   7   |

Lv7-1x7-4	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a solution that satisfies all the conditions:


#############
|             |   1    |  2   |   3   |  4   |  5   |     6     |    7    |
| Transport   | roller | taxi | bike  | ship | train | quad-bike | scooter |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I derived the solution:

From clue 3, we know the person driving the train is on the left or right of the person driving the bike. Combining this with clue 6, which states that the person driving the bike is to the left of the person driving the train, we can conclude that the bike and train are in positions 3 and 5, respectively (in some order).

From clue 9, we know the person driving the train is to the right of the person driving the roller. Since the train is already placed at position 5, the roller must be at an odd position##4, as stated in clue 2. The only remaining odd position is 1.

Clue 7 states that the taxi is between the ship and bike. Given the positions of the bike (3) and train (5), the only possible position for the taxi is 2.

From clue 5, we know the ship is between the quad-bike and taxi. Since the taxi is at position 2, the ship must be at position 4.

Clue 8 states that the person driving the quad-bike is to the left of the scooter. The only remaining positions are 6 and 7, so we can place the quad-bike and scooter in those positions, respectively.

Finally, we have satisfied all the conditions and arrived at a unique solution.

Lv7-1x7-5	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|             |   1    |     2     |   3   |  4  |     5      |     6      |    7    |
| Transport   | Subway | Quad-bike | Trike | Car | Helicopter | Skateboard | Scooter |

 

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 6, the subway is on the far left or far right. From clue 4, the quad-bike is to the right of the subway, so the subway must be on the far left.

Clue 3 says the trike is to the right of the quad-bike, and clue 7 confirms this.

From clue 5, the trike is next to the car. Since the trike is already to the right of the quad-bike, it must be to the left of the car (clue 9).

Clue 1 says the helicopter is next to the car, so it must be to the right of the car.

From clue 8, the skateboard is to the left of the scooter. Clue 10 says the skateboard is to the right of the quad-bike, so it must be in position 6.

Clue 2 says the scooter is to the right of the car, but since the helicopter is already there, it must be in position 7.

Therefore, the final solution table is:

|         | puzzles | board-games|  gardening | magic-tricks | cooking  | reading | chess |

Here's how I deduced the solution:


From clue 8, puzzles is either on the far left or far right. Since it can't be on the far right (due to clue 3), it must be on the far left.


Clue 7 tells us that board-games is to the left of magic-tricks.


Clue 2 places gardening to the left of cooking, and clue 5 puts gardening next to magic-tricks. This means magic-tricks can't be in column 1 or 2 (since gardening would be on the wrong side), so it must be in column 4.


Now we have: puzzles, board-games, ?, ?, magic-tricks, ?, ?


Clue 6 says cooking is... well, just itself. But from clue 2 and 5, we know gardening and magic-tricks are next to each other, with cooking on the right of one of them (clue 1). So, gardening must be in column 3.


We now have: puzzles, board-games, gardening, ?, magic-tricks, ?, ?


Clue 9 says reading is between puzzles and cooking. Since cooking can't be in columns 1-4 (due to previous clues), it must be in column 5.


This means the remaining hobbies are chess (which goes on the right of cooking) and reading, which fills the gap between puzzles and cooking.


The final solution is:

#############


Here's a brief explanation of the deductions:


From clue 3, Spanish is in an odd position. From clue 2, Turkish is on the left of Colombian.
From clue 4, Japanese is to the left of Colombian. Since Spanish is between Argentine and Colombian (clue 5), we have:
...-Argentine-Spanish-Colombian...

Since British is between Japanese and Spanish (clue 1), we can place British:
...-Japanese-British-Argentine-Spanish-Colombian...

Now, Nigerian is to the right of Argentine (clue 6) and also to the right of British (clue 7):
...-Japanese-British-Argentine-Nigerian-Spanish-Colombian...

Finally, Turkish is on the left of Colombian (clue 2), so it must be in position 1 or 2. Since Argentine is already in position 1, we can place Turkish:
Turkish-Japanese-British-Argentine-Nigerian-Colombian-Spanish"

|#############| Security-Guard | Writer | Police-Officer | Mechanic | Firefighter | Scientist | Designer |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 2, the police-officer must be in an odd position. From clue 1 and 11, the police-officer is on the left or right of the firefighter, but not directly next to them (since they are also on the left of the firefighter). Therefore, the police-officer must be in position 3.


From clue 8, the writer is to the left of the police-officer. Since the security-guard is on the far left or far right (clue 7), and the security-guard is on the left or right of the designer (clue 10), it's likely that the security-guard is in position 1.


From clue 3, the mechanic is to the left of the scientist. From clues 4 and 5, the mechanic is between the designer and the writer, but closer to the designer. Since the police-officer is in position 3, the mechanic must be in position 4.


The firefighter can't be on the far right (since the security-guard might be there), so they are likely in position 5.


From clue 6, the mechanic is to the left of the firefighter. This fits with our current solution.


Finally, we have the scientist and designer left to place. From clue 3, the scientist must be after the mechanic, so it's likely that the scientist is in position 6 and the designer is in position 7.


This completes the puzzle:

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

1. Clues 2 and 5 imply that the Canadian is to the left of the British, who is to the left of the Japanese.
2. Clue 3 states that the Egyptian is between the Canadian and Polish, so the order must be: Canadian -> Egyptian -> Polish.
3. From clue 6, we know the Canadian is to the left of the Egyptian, confirming this order.
4. Clue 7 states that the Mexican is to the right of the Japanese, so the order for these three is: British -> Mexican -> Japanese (clues 5 and 8 also support this).
5. Clue 10 implies that the Polish is to the left of the British.
6. Considering clues 3 and 9, we know the Egyptian must be between the Canadian and Polish, so the order is confirmed as: Canadian -> Egyptian -> Polish.
7. Finally, clue 4 states that the Malaysian is on either side of the Mexican. Since there are no other available positions for the Malaysian, it must be next to the Mexican.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 3, we know that Romance is in the middle, so it must be at position 4.
2. From clue 9, we know that Romance is to the left of Animation, so Animation can't be before Romance.
3. From clue 8, we know that Romance is to the left of Zombie, and from clue 5, Zombie is between Scientific and Disaster.
4. Since Romance is in the middle (position 4), Zombie must be at position 7.
5. From clue 2, Martial-arts is between Documentary and Zombie, so it can't be before Documentary or after Zombie.
6. From clue 1, Martial-arts is on either side of Documentary, but since it's also to the left of Romance (clue 7), it must be at position 5.
7. Now that we have Martial-arts at position 5 and Zombie at position 7, Scientific can't be between them, so it must be before Documentary (position 2).
