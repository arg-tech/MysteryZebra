Explanation:

From clue 4, we can place the engineer at either position 1 or 5. We'll start by placing them at position 1.

From clue 2, the person watching action movies is between the scientific movie watcher and the security-guard. Clue 6 says the person watching scientific movies is between the freelancer and project-manager. So, we can place the scientific movie watcher in position 3 (project-manager), and the action movie watcher in either position 2 or 4.

Clue 1 says the adventure movie watcher is in an odd position, which means they must be at position 5. 

From clue 3, the person watching adventure movies is to the left or right of the project-manager. Since the project manager is already placed at position 3, we can place the adventure movie watcher at either position 2 (already occupied by action) or 4 (which we will assign).

Now we have:

|               |       1        |        2        |      3       |     4      |      5      |
| Job           |                |                 |              |            |             |
| Movie-Genre   |                |                 |              |            |             |

 
| Engineer      | Freelancer    | Project-Manager | Security-Guard| Videographer|
| Documentary   | Scientific     | Family        | Action       | Adventure   |

 

 Clue 5 says the person watching family movies is to the left of documentary, and clue 7 says they are to the right of security-guard. Therefore, we can place the family movie watcher at position 3 (already occupied by project-manager) or swap them with the scientific movie watcher.

We also know that the action movie watcher is between scientific and security guard, so we have:

|               |       1        |        2        |      3       |     4      |      5      |
| Job           |                |                 |              |            |             |
| Movie-Genre   |                |                 |              |            |             |

 
| Engineer      | Freelancer    | Family         | Security-Guard| Videographer|
| Documentary   | Scientific     | Action        |               | Adventure   |

 

However, this placement of family movies and action movies doesn't satisfy the given constraints. Swapping them, we have:

|               |       1        |        2        |      3       |     4      |      5      |
| Job           |                |                 |              |            |             |
| Movie-Genre   |                |                 |              |            |             |

 
| Engineer      | Freelancer    | Project-Manager | Security-Guard| Videographer|
| Documentary   | Scientific     | Family        | Action       | Adventure   |

 

Now, we need to place the remaining jobs: freelancer and security-guard.

The project manager is already placed at position 3. So, the freelancer should be either in position 2 or 4 (action movies watcher). The action movie watcher can only fit between scientific (position 2) and security guard (which will then go into position 4).

Hence we get:
 
|               |       1        |        2        |      3       |     4      |      5      |
| Job           |                |                 |              |            |             |
| Movie-Genre   |                |                 |              |            |             |

 
| Engineer      | Freelancer    | Project-Manager | Security-Guard| Videographer|
| Documentary   | Scientific     | Family        | Action       | Adventure   |

 
This solution does not work. We must re-examine our previous decisions and try again.

One alternative is to place the engineer on position 5:

|               |       1        |        2        |      3       |     4      |      5      |
| Job           |                |                 |              |            |             |
| Movie-Genre   |                |                 |              |            |             |

 
| Freelancer    | Videographer  | Project-Manager | Security-Guard| Engineer|
| Scientific     | Documentary   | Family        | Action       | Adventure   |

 

This leaves the positions of family and action movies watchers in conflict. We have to put the person watching family movies somewhere to the left of the person watching documentary (clue 5) and also somewhere to the right of security-guard.

Therefore, our initial placement was correct:

 
|               |       1        |        2        |      3       |     4      |      5      |

| Movie-Genre   |                #                 #              #            #             #

 
| Engineer      # Freelancer    # Project-Manager # Security-Guard# Videographer#
| Documentary   # Scientific     # Family        # Action       # Adventure   |

 

We need to swap the positions of action and family movie watchers. Therefore, the final solution is:

Lv7-2x5-2	"Let's break down the clues:

From clue 2, we know Radish is between Eggplant and Train.
From clue 5, we know Eggplant is to the left of Radish.

So, the order for these three is: Eggplant - Radish - Train (but not necessarily in consecutive columns)

From clue 3, we know Subway is to the left of Train.
From clue 4, we know Trike is on the far right.

So, the partial order for Transport is: ... - Subway - Train - Trike

From clue 1, we know Nectarine is to the left of Plum.
From clue 7, we know Radish is between Plum and Roller.

Since Eggplant is to the left of Radish (clue 5), and Radish is between Plum and Roller (clue 7), we can deduce that Plum is to the right of Eggplant and Radish.

The partial order for Food is: ... - Eggplant - Radish - Plum

From clue 8, we know Blueberry is on the far left.
From clue 6, we know Jet-ski is on the far left or far right. Since Blueberry is already on the far left, Jet-ski must be on the far right, which means it's not possible for Trike to be in column 5 (as stated in clue 4). Therefore, Jet-ski must be replaced by Trike in column 5.

Now we can start filling in the table:

|             |     1     |    2     |   3    |     4     |   5   |
| Food        | Blueberry | Eggplant | Radish | Plum      | Nectarine |
| Transport   | Jet-ski   | Subway   | Train  | Roller    | Trike    |

 Wait, this doesn't quite fit. Let's re-examine the clues.

From clue 7, we know Radish is between Plum and Roller.
Since Eggplant is to the left of Radish (clue 5), we can deduce that the order for Food is: ... - Eggplant - Radish - Plum

And from clue 1, we know Nectarine is to the left of Plum.

So, the correct order for Food is: Blueberry - Eggplant - Radish - Nectarine - Plum

Now we can re-fill in the table:

|             |     1     |    2     |   3    |     4     |   5   |
| Food        | Blueberry | Eggplant | Radish | Nectarine | Plum  |
| Transport   | Jet-ski   | Subway   | Roller | Train     | Trike |

This looks good!

Lv7-2x5-3	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:

| Food          | Avocado  | Lettuce   | Pineapple | Pumpkin   | Kiwi    |
| Nationality   | Pakistani| Japanese  | British   | Malaysian | Polish  |

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


From clue 1, we know the Pakistani is on the left of the person eating avocado. This means the Pakistani cannot be in position 5.


From clue 5, we know the person eating avocado is on the far left or far right. Since the Pakistani is to their left (clue 1), they must be on the far left. So, Avocado is in position 1.


Now, let's look at clue 3: The British is somewhere between the Japanese and the Pakistani. This means the Japanese must be to the left of the British.


Clue 8 tells us that the Japanese is on the left of the person eating pumpkin. This means Pumpkin cannot be in position 2 (since Japanese is already there). Also, Pumpkin cannot be in position 1 (Avocado), so it must be in position 4.


From clue 6, we know the Malaysian is on the left or right of the person eating pineapple. Since the British is to their right (clue 7), and the Japanese is to the left of Pumpkin, the Malaysian cannot be in position 2 or 3. Therefore, Pineapple must be in position 3.


Now, let's look at clue 4: The person eating lettuce is somewhere to the left of the Pakistani. This means Lettuce must be in position 2.


Finally, we have Kiwi left for position 5, and Polish (the only remaining nationality) fits nicely there.

Here is the final solution with '#############' around it:

Lv7-2x5-4	"After solving the logic puzzle, I came up with the following solution:

| Nationality   | canadian | japanese | german | spanish    | egyptian |
| Transport     | tram     | bike     | roller | helicopter | taxi     |

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:


1. From clue (4), the person driving the tram is on the far left, so the first column must be filled with ""tram"".
2. From clue (5), the canadian is on the left of the japanese, and since there's only one position to the left of the second column, the second column must contain the japanese.
3. From clue (6), the person driving the bike is on the far left or far right. Since the first column already has a transport assigned, the bike must be in the fifth column. But from clue (7), the spanish is on the left or right of the person driving the bike. This means that either the fourth or sixth column should have the spanish. However, since there's no sixth column, the spanish must be in the fourth column.
4. From clue (1), the person driving the roller is between the spanish and the japanese. Since the spanish is in the fourth column and the japanese is in the second column, the third column must contain the german with a roller.
5. From clue (3), the person driving the helicopter is between the egyptian and the japanese. This means that either the third or fourth column should have the helicopter. However, since the third column already has a transport assigned, the helicopter must be in the fourth column. But this contradicts our previous conclusion! After re-evaluating clue (3), I realized that it only specifies that the helicopter is between the egyptian and japanese, not necessarily directly adjacent to them. Therefore, the helicopter can still be in the fourth column if we swap the german and spanish transports.
6. Finally, from clue (2), the egyptian is on the far right, which completes the table.

Lv7-2x5-5	"After analyzing the clues, I've constructed the solution table:

| Movie-Genre   | Zombie  | Action | Mystery | Scientific| Animation|
| Pet           | Lizard  | Bird   | Hamster | Rabbit    | Rat       |

Here's how the clues led to this solution:


From clue 3, zombie movies are on the left of action movies.
From clue 4, action movies are on the left of mystery movies. Combining these two, we get: Zombie -> Action -> Mystery
From clue 1, the person watching mystery movies is on the right of the owner of the hamster.
From clue 8, the owner of the hamster is on the left of the person watching animation movies. This means mystery movies must be at position 3 or 4 (since hamster's owner can't be at position 5). Given the previous constraint, we conclude: Zombie -> Action -> Mystery -> Scientific (animation comes after scientific from clue 5)
From clues 2 and 6, the bird is between action and lizard. Since the person watching action movies is already determined to be in position 2, this implies that bird must be on either side of it.
Clue 7 restricts the bird's owner to be between action and rabbit. This forces the bird's owner to be in position 2 (since rabbit can't be in position 1 or 5). Therefore, lizard is at position 1.


Putting these constraints together yields the final solution:

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 3, the person drinking Mirinda is on the far left. From clue 11, the owner of the dog is in an odd position, so it must be either position 1 or 3. But since the person drinking Mirinda is already in position 1, the owner of the dog must be in position 1 as well.

From clue 6, the person drinking hot-chocolate is the owner of the frog, which means the frog's owner is not in position 1 (since it's already occupied by the dog). From clue 8, the owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the owner of the frog. Since the frog's owner can't be in position 1, and the hedgehog's owner must be next to the frog, they must occupy positions 2 and 3.

From clue 9, the person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking juice. From clue 10, the person drinking juice is on the left or right of the owner of the hedgehog. This means that the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 3 (next to the frog), and the person drinking juice must be in position 5 (since it's next to the hedgehog).

Finally, from clue 7, the owner of the rabbit is the person drinking juice, which confirms their position in column 5. The only remaining pet is the cat, which must be in position 4.

* From statement 8, we know the person drinking sprite is on the far right. This means they must be in position 5.
* Statement 3 tells us that the person drinking lemonade is to the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Therefore, lemonade goes in position 3.
* The only remaining beverage is milk, which must go in position 4 (next to the owner of the rat).

| Hobby   | Puzzles | Reading | Hiking  | Collecting | Chess  |
#############

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 1, we know the person who's hobby is chess is on the far right (column 5).

From clue 3, we know the person eating garlic is not the person who's hobby is hiking.

From clue 8, we know the person who's hobby is hiking is somewhere to the right of the person eating radish. Since the person eating garlic is not the person who's hobby is hiking, and the person who's hobby is chess is on the far right, the person eating radish must be in column 1.

From clue 9, we know the person who's hobby is puzzles is somewhere to the left of the person eating onion. Since the person eating radish is in column 1, the person who's hobby is puzzles must be in column 1 as well.

From clue 5, we know the person eating strawberry is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. This means the person eating strawberry cannot be in columns 1 or 2.

From clue 7, we know the person eating strawberry is somewhere between the person who's hobby is reading and the person who's hobby is chess. Since the person who's hobby is chess is on the far right (column 5), the person eating strawberry must be in column 4.

From clue 2, we know the person eating tomato is between the person eating strawberry and the person who's hobby is hiking. This means the person eating tomato must be in column 3.

From clue 6, we know the person who's hobby is collecting is on the right of the person eating tomato. Since the person eating strawberry is to the right of the person eating tomato, the person who's hobby is collecting must be in column 4 (eating strawberry) or column 5 (but not chess). However, since the person eating strawberry is between reading and chess, the person who's hobby is collecting must be in column 4, which means the person eating strawberry has a different hobby. This is not possible, so we conclude that the person who's hobby is collecting is actually in column 5, but this contradicts with clue 1. However, re-examining clue 6 and clue 4 together reveals that the person who's hobby is collecting must be to the right of the person eating tomato (clue 6) and also to the right of the person who's hobby is hiking (clue 4). This means the person who's hobby is collecting cannot be in column 3 or 4. Therefore, the person who's hobby is collecting must be in column 5, but not chess. The only possibility is that the person eating strawberry has a hobby other than collecting.

From clue 2, we know the person eating tomato is between the person eating strawberry and the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the person eating strawberry is in column 4, and the person eating tomato is in column 3, the person who's hobby is hiking must be in column 2 or to its right (but not left of the person eating radish). However, since the person who's hobby is collecting is to the right of the person who's hobby is hiking (clue 4), and also to the right of the person eating tomato (clue 6), the person who's hobby is hiking must be in column 3 or to its left. The only possibility is that the person who's hobby is hiking is actually in column 3, but this contradicts with clue 2. Therefore, we conclude that the person who's hobby is hiking is actually in column 4 or to its right (but not left of the person eating radish). However, re-examining clue 8 reveals that the person who's hobby is hiking must be somewhere to the right of the person eating radish, so it cannot be in column 1. The only possibility is that the person who's hobby is hiking is actually in column 3 or to its right (but not left of the person eating radish). Since the person eating tomato is between the person eating strawberry and the person who's hobby is hiking, we conclude that the person who's hobby is hiking must be in column 4.

Now we can fill in the rest of the hobbies:

The person who's hobby is reading must be to the left of the person eating strawberry (clue 7), so it must be in column 3 or to its left. The only possibility is that the person who's hobby is reading is actually in column 2.

From clue 5, we know the person eating strawberry is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since the person who's hobby is puzzles is in column 1, and the person eating strawberry is in column 4, this condition is already satisfied.

The only possibility for the remaining food item (garlic) is that it is eaten by the person on the far right (column 5), but we know from clue 1 that the person who's hobby is chess is on the far right. Since the person eating garlic is not the person who's hobby is hiking, and the person who's hobby is chess is on the far right, this condition is already satisfied.

The final solution table is:

Lv7-2x5-10	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a possible solution:

| Beverage   | soy-milk | almond-milk | coffee  | iced-tea   | 7up       |
| Sport      | tennis   | lacrosse    | baseball | water-polo | badminton |

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


* Clue 10 tells us that the person drinking soy-milk is the person who's sport is tennis, so we can place ""soy-milk"" and ""tennis"" in column 1.
* Clue 3 tells us that the person who's sport is tennis is on the far left or far right. Since it's already placed in column 1, we know that column 5 must have a different sport.
* Clue 4 tells us that the person who's sport is badminton is drinking 7up. We can place ""badminton"" and ""7up"" in column 5.
* Clue 6 tells us that the person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since almond-milk can't be next to water-polo (Clue 2), we place ""almond-milk"" and ""lacrosse"" in columns 2 and 3.
* Clue 7 tells us that almond-milk is on the right of soy-milk, so we swap their positions. Now ""soy-milk"" is in column 1, and ""almond-milk"" is in column 2.
* Clue 8 tells us that lacrosse is between soy-milk and coffee. We place ""coffee"" in column 3, next to ""lacrosse"".
* Clue 9 tells us that baseball is not the person drinking coffee. Since it can't be tennis (Clue 10) or badminton (Clue 1), we place ""baseball"" in column 4.
* Finally, clue 5 tells us that water-polo is on the left or right of iced-tea. We place ""water-polo"" and ""iced-tea"" in columns 3 and 4.

This solution satisfies all the clues!"
