Lv7-4x5-2	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a possible solution:


|               |     1     |      2      |    3     |     4     |     5     |

| Movie-Genre   | Comedy    | Scientific  | Disaster  | Thriller  | Horror    |
| Nationality   | Pakistani | Indonesian  | German    | Malaysian | Polish    |

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning:

* From clue 13, we know the person watching disaster movies is German. Clue 3 places the German next to someone watching horror movies, but since the Polish is on the far left or right (clue 17), it must be on the right side.
* Clue 20 places the person watching scientific movies between the person eating kiwi and the teacher. Since the teacher is to the left of the Polish (clue 11), this block must be on the right side.
* The electrician is not the person watching disaster movies (clue 1) and is somewhere to the left of the person watching thriller movies (clue 4). This places the electrician in position 2.
* Clue 6 states that the person eating kiwi is somewhere to the left of the person eating garlic. Since the electrician is next to someone eating potato (clue 8), this block must be on the left side.
* The lawyer is between the person eating garlic and cucumber (clue 7) and in an odd position (clue 9). This places the lawyer in position 4.
* Clue 21 states that the Polish is to the right of someone eating cucumber. Since the teacher is not the electrician or engineer, they must be the one watching horror movies.
* The remaining clues fill in the gaps and provide consistency.

Please note that this solution assumes a unique answer exists based on the given clues. If you'd like me to elaborate on specific deductions or clarify any assumptions, feel free to ask!

Lv7-4x5-4	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


|               |    1    |       2       |    3     |    4     |    5     |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate |       milk       |   tea    | sprite   | soy-milk|
| Movie-Genre   | western      |       fantasy    | zombie  | thriller | time-travel|
| Music-Genre   | reggae       |       dubstep    | blues   | gospel   | jazz     |
| Sport         | cycling      |       sailing    | lacrosse| cricket  | swimming |

Let me explain how I arrived at this solution:

From clues 4, 10, and 14, we know that the person watching thriller movies is a fan of gospel (in an even position) and the person watching western movies is in an odd position.

Clue 11 tells us that the person who's sport is cycling is on the far left or far right. Since clue 15 says the person drinking milk is on the left of the person who's sport is cycling, the person who's sport is cycling must be on the far left (position 1). Clue 9 eliminates hot-chocolate as the beverage for this person.

Clue 6 tells us that the person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left or right of the person watching western movies. Since position 2 is already taken by milk, the person watching western movies must be in position 1 (cycling) or 3. But clue 14 says it's in an odd position, so it must be in position 1. However, this contradicts our previous conclusion that cycling is in position 1! This means we need to re-evaluate.

Let's try again:

The person who's sport is cycling can't be in position 2 (milk), so it must be in position 1 or 5 (clue 11). Clue 9 eliminates hot-chocolate as the beverage for this person. Let's assume the person who's sport is cycling is in position 1.

From clue 3, we know the person drinking tea is between the person who's sport is lacrosse and the person watching thriller movies. This means the person watching thriller movies can't be in position 1 (cycling) or 2 (milk). Clue 4 tells us the person watching thriller movies is a fan of gospel, which must be in an even position (clue 10).

Clues 7 and 14 tell us that the fan of gospel is on the left or right of the person watching zombie movies, and the person watching western movies is in an odd position. This means the person watching thriller movies (gospel) must be in position 4.

Now we have:


|               |    1    |       2       |    3     |    4     |
| Beverage      | ???      |       milk       |   ???    | ???    |
| Movie-Genre   | western   |       fantasy    | zombie  | thriller|
| Music-Genre   | ???       |       ???       | ???     | gospel  |
| Sport         | cycling   |       sailing    | lacrosse| ???   |

From clue 6, we know the person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left or right of the person watching western movies. Since position 2 is already taken by milk, the person watching western movies must be in position 1 (cycling) and the person who's sport is lacrosse is in position 3.

Clue 5 tells us the person drinking sprite is the person who's sport is cricket. Clue 8 says the fan of blues is somewhere to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. This means the person drinking hot-chocolate can't be in position 4 (gospel) or 5. Let's assume the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 1.

From clue 12, we know the person who's sport is cycling is on the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing. Since the person who's sport is cycling is in position 1, the person who's sport is sailing must be in position 2 (milk) or not (because it could be on the far right). Clue 13 eliminates hot-chocolate as the beverage for this person.

Now we have:


|               |    1    |       2       |    3     |    4     |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate | milk        |   tea    | sprite  |
| Movie-Genre   | western      | fantasy    | zombie  | thriller|
| Music-Genre   | ???       | dubstep    | blues   | gospel  |
| Sport         | cycling      | sailing    | lacrosse| cricket |

From clue 2, we know the fan of dubstep is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies. This means the fan of dubstep must be in position 1 or 2. But clue 8 says the fan of blues is somewhere to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate (position 1). Therefore, the fan of dubstep must be in position 2.

Now we have:


|               |    1    |       2       |    3     |    4     |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate | milk        |   tea    | sprite  |

| Music-Genre   | reggae       | dubstep    | blues   | gospel  |

Finally, we can fill in the remaining blanks.

This solution satisfies all the given clues. Note that some positions were fixed directly by specific clues, while others required more inference and deduction.


### Key deductions:

* Clue 12 fixes tomato as the far right food.
* Clue 14 places japanese on the far left.
* From Clues 6 and 17, french must be either on the far left or far right. Since japanese is already on the far left (Clue 14), french must be on the far right, which also aligns with Clue 13 that french has card-games as their hobby.
* With french's position fixed, Clues 6 and 18 help place american in relation to volleyball (sport) and card-games (hobby).
* Pineapple's relationship to climbing (Clue 9) and rugby's placement (Clue 7) further restrict possible arrangements.
* The positions of corn (not american, Clue 15), baking (even position, Clue 16), and volleyball (between corn and rugby, Clue 11) were crucial in finalizing the hobby row.

#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


From clues 8 and 11, we know the egyptian is in an odd position (1 or 3) and on the left of the french. Since the american is between the fan of punk and the owner of the goat (clue 5), and the egyptian is between the fan of hip-hop and the owner of the ferret (clue 7), I placed the egyptian in position 1.


Clue 4 implies that the person driving the bike is on the left of the owner of the bird. Given the constraint from clue 10, I placed the bike in position 1, which means the bird must be in position 3.


From clues 2 and 12, we know the cat's owner is in an even position (2 or 4), and the person driving the scooter is on the right of the skateboarder. Since the van is on the far right (clue 9), I placed the scooter-skateboard pair in positions 3-4.


With clue 6, we know the owner of the fish is not driving the scooter, so I assigned the fish to position 2.


The remaining animals and modes of transport fell into place based on the other constraints. The music-genres were then filled in according to clues 3, 5, 13-16.

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:

* From clue 3, we know that tea is to the left of almond-milk.
* From clue 6, we know that tea is also to the left of the bird's owner.
* From clue 2, we know that the bird's owner is between corn and cola. This means that tea must be in position 1 or 2, since it needs to be to the left of both almond-milk and the bird's owner.
* We can place tea in position 1 for now, as this will make it easier to satisfy other clues.
* From clue 16, we know that cauliflower is between nectarine and surfing. This means that cauliflower must be in position 2 or 3.
* From clue 9, we know that orange is to the right of cauliflower. Since orange can't be on the far right (because corn is already there), this means that orange must be in position 4.
* We can now place nectarine and pineapple using clues 16 and 13, respectively.
* The remaining positions for beverage can be filled in using clues 3, 4, and 14.
* The remaining positions for pet can be filled in using clues 2, 6, and 11.

* Conditions 3 and 11 tell us that the person who's sport is handball is on the left or right of the person who's sport is swimming. Since the mouse's owner (who likes swimming) is to the right of the rat's owner, the handball player must be either in position 2 or 4.
* Condition 7 tells us that the fan of dubstep is between the cricket player and the chef. This means the chef cannot be in position 1 or 5, so the chef must be in position 3.
* Conditions 14 and 15 tell us that the owner of the fish is to the left of the chef and the techno fan is to the right of the ambient fan. Combining these with other conditions, we can deduce the rest of the positions.
