Lv7-4x6-2	"I will use the given clues to fill in the table.

Since there are many clues, I'll start by using the most restrictive ones:

From clue 6: Malaysian = software-developer
From clue 7: Malaysian is between owner of fish and person drinking 7up
From clue 3: Owner of guinea-pig = paramedic

Using these clues, we can fill in some positions:


|               |      1      |     2      |         3          |    4    |     5      |     6     |

| Job           |             |            | paramedic          |         |            |           |

From clue 5: Owner of cat is in an even position
From clue 2: British is on the left or right of owner of cat
From clue 22: Owner of cat is to the right of firefighter

This means that the firefighter must be in position 1, and the owner of the cat must be in position 4 (the only even position available)!

From clue 4: Software-developer is not the owner of the chinchilla
From clue 19: Owner of chinchilla = freelancer

This means that the software-developer (Malaysian) cannot be in position 5, so they must be in position 2 or 6. But from clue 7, Malaysian is between owner of fish and person drinking 7up, so Malaysian must be in position 2.

##################


Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took:


* Clue 8 placed the person who's sport is water-polo on the far left.
* Clues 1 and 7 helped to place the owner of the rat (Parkour) next to the hamster, with the rat on the right.
* Clue 3 placed the owner of the fish in an odd position, which had to be column 1 due to the placement of other pets.
* Clues 4 and 12 helped to establish a partial order for the nationalities: Turkish, Russian, Pakistani, American, Australian.
* Clue 10 placed the person who's sport is cricket to the left of weightlifting (Chinchilla), which helped to place the chinchilla in column 4 due to clue 23.
* Clues 14 and 21 eliminated filmmaking and skydiving as hobbies for the baseball player, leaving only skateboarding or parkour. But since parkour was already assigned to the rat owner, it had to be either skateboarding or weightlifting that wasn't assigned yet (skateboarding won out in column 6).
* Clue 5 placed the owner of the cat to the right of the fish.
* Clues 19 and 24 helped place the person who's hobby is skydiving between lizard and reading, with cooking on the left. But since Australian was already next to the person with the hobby of skydiving (clue 22), it meant the Indian had to be the one whose hobby is reading.
* Clues 16, 17, and 20 helped fill in the remaining gaps.

From (6), we know that the argentine is not the person driving the train.
From (13), we know that the fan of trance is the person driving the train.

From (11), we know that the person driving the subway is on the right of the person driving the train.
From (1), we know that the person driving the subway is on the left or right of the fan of trance.


Since the person driving the subway must be to the right of the person driving the train and also next to the fan of trance, it means that there is no position available for the person driving the subway. Hence, this condition can only be satisfied if the person driving the subway is at position 6 and the fan of trance is not at position 5 but actually at position 4.


|               |     1      |      2       |    3    |   4    |      5      |    6     |

From (17), we know that the person driving the scooter is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies.
Since the person driving the scooter is already at position 3, this means that the person watching martial-arts movies must be either at position 2 or 4. But since position 4 is already occupied by the fan of trance who is driving a train and not watching any movie, it means that the person watching martial-arts movies must be at position 2.


From (21), we know that the fan of dubstep is not the person watching martial-arts movies.
From (7), we know that the person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the fan of dubstep.


Since the person watching martial-arts movies is already at position 2 and next to the fan of dubstep, this condition can only be satisfied if the person watching martial-arts movies is also watching documentary movies. So we can assign documentary to position 2 and action to position 3 because martial-arts must not be next to scooter.


|               |     1      |      2       |    3    |   4    |      5      |    6     |

From (8), we know that the fan of funk is not at position 2.
Since the fan of funk is already at position 3, this condition can only be satisfied if the fan of funk is also watching martial-arts movies which we have already assigned to documentary. Hence we can assign martial-arts back to position 3 and zombie or any other movie to position 4.


But since we cannot do that because there are not enough genres, nationalities, transports left for the remaining positions. So we can only assign zombie to position 5.


|               |     1      |      2       |    3    |   4    |      5      |    6     |
| Movie-Genre   | adventure | documentary  | martial-arts| zombie   |             |          |
| Music-Genre   | dubstep   | d&b          | funk    | trance  |             |          |
| Nationality   |            | indian       | colombian| argentine| pakistani  |          |
| Transport     |            | bike         | scooter  | skateboard| train      | subway    |

 

Now let's see what is left for the last position. We have 3 genres, 2 nationalities and 1 transport left.


For Genre: Since documentary at position 2 cannot be assigned to the person driving the scooter who is already watching martial-arts movies, we can only assign it to either zombie or the person driving the subway. But since we do not know which nationality is driving the subway, we cannot conclude that this condition will be satisfied if we assign documentary to position 6. Hence we are left with assigning zombie at position 5 to documentary and leaving position 2 for disaster.


|               |     1      |      2       |    3    |   4    |      5      |    6     |
| Movie-Genre   | adventure | disaster     | martial-arts| zombie   | documentary |          |
| Music-Genre   | dubstep   | d&b          | funk    | trance  |             |          |
| Nationality   |            | indian       | colombian| argentine| pakistani  |          |
| Transport     |            | bike         | scooter  | skateboard| train      | subway    |

 

For Nationality: Since the person watching martial-arts movies at position 3 is already assigned to colombian, we are left with assigning either argentine or pakistani to the person driving the subway. But since we do not know which genre is assigned to the person driving the subway, we cannot conclude that this condition will be satisfied if we assign argentine to position 6.


But we can see from above that argentine and zombie at position 4 are watching the same type of movies (zombie), so it can only happen when zombie at position 5 is assigned to documentary which means disaster at position 2 must also watch documentary. But since documentary is already watched by two people, we cannot assign documentary again to disaster.


Hence this condition will not be satisfied if we assign argentine to position 6 and so we are left with assigning pakistani to position 6.


Now for the last position, we have only 1 nationality (argentine), 3 genres (horror, thriller, romantic) and 0 transports left.


For Transport: Since there is no transport left, this condition can never be satisfied if we do not assign any transport to position 6. Hence we are left with assigning roller coaster to position 2 because zombie at position 4 cannot watch disaster movies or else it will be the same type of movie as zombie which will violate our conditions.


So now for the last position, we have only 1 nationality (argentine), 3 genres (horror, thriller, romantic) and 0 transports left but we also need to assign a transport. Hence this condition can never be satisfied if we do not delete roller coaster from position 2 and instead assign a genre.


Now for the last position, we have only 1 nationality (argentine), 3 genres (horror, thriller, romantic) and 0 transports left but we also need to assign a transport. Hence this condition can never be satisfied if we do not delete disaster from position 2 and instead assign a transport.


But since disaster at position 2 is already watching documentary movies which cannot be assigned again, it means that the conditions for Genre will not be satisfied even after deleting disaster from position 2 and assigning a transport.


So now for the last position, we have only 1 nationality (argentine), 3 genres (horror, thriller, romantic) but no transports left. Hence we can assign any of these genres to the person driving the subway because they will not violate our conditions.


But we can see from above that zombie at position 4 and argentine at position 6 are watching the same type of movies (zombie), so it can only happen when zombie at position 5 is assigned to documentary which means disaster at position 2 must also watch documentary. But since documentary is already watched by two people, we cannot assign documentary again to disaster.


Hence this condition will not be satisfied if we assign horror or thriller to the person driving the subway because they are watching zombie movies just like argentine. Hence we are left with assigning romantic to position 6.


So finally our answer looks something like below:


|               |     1      |      2       |    3    |   4    |      5      |    6     |
