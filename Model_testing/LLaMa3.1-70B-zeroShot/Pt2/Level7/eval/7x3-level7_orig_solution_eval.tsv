Lv7-7x3-1	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |      1      |     2     |     3     |
| Beverage      | Mirinda    | Milk      | Sprite    |
| Food          | Kiwi       | Cranberry | Mango     |
| Hobby         | Photography| Chess     | Camping   |
| Music-Genre   | Soul       | Rock      | House     |
| Nationality   | German     | Indonesian| Dutch     |
| Pet           | Chinchilla | Goldfish  | Hamster   |
| Sport         | Badminton  | Surfing   | Lacrosse  |


Let me walk you through the deductions I made:


* From clue 4 and 9, we know that the person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the Indonesian and the owner of the chinchilla.
* Clue 2 tells us that the person who's hobby is chess is also on the right of the Indonesian. This means that the Indonesian must be in position 1 or 2, and the person with chess as a hobby is in position 3.
* From clue 5, we know that the person who's hobby is photography is in an odd position. Since there are only three positions, this means that the person with photography as a hobby must be in either position 1 or 3.
* Clue 8 tells us that the German is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is camping. This means that the German cannot be in position 3 (since there is no one to their right), so they must be in either position 1 or 2.
* From clue 12, we know that the person drinking Mirinda is on the far left or far right. Since we already have a candidate for the far right (the person with chess as a hobby), this means that the person drinking Mirinda must be on the far left, in position 1.
* Clue 10 tells us that the person drinking Sprite is somewhere to the left of the fan of House. This means that the person drinking Sprite cannot be in position 3 (since there is no one to their right), so they must be in either position 1 or 2. However, we already have a candidate for position 1 (the person drinking Mirinda), so this means that the person drinking Sprite must be in position 2.
* From clue 6, we know that the person eating Cranberry is somewhere between the person who's sport is Badminton and the person drinking Milk. This means that the person eating Cranberry cannot be in position 1 (since there is no one to their left), so they must be in either position 2 or 3.
* Clue 11 tells us that the person eating Kiwi is somewhere to the right of the person drinking Milk. This means that the person eating Kiwi cannot be in position 1 (since there is no one to their left), so they must be in either position 2 or 3. However, we already have a candidate for position 2 (the person eating Cranberry), so this means that the person eating Kiwi must be in position 1.
* Clue 7 tells us that the person who's sport is Surfing is somewhere to the left of the owner of the Goldfish. This means that the person who's sport is Surfing cannot be in position 3 (since there is no one to their right), so they must be in either position 1 or 2.
* From clue 3, we know that the person eating Mango is somewhere to the left of the fan of Soul. This means that the person eating Mango cannot be in position 3 (since there is no one to their right), so they must be in either position 1 or 2.

After analyzing all these clues, I came up with the solution above.

#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:


From clue 4, we know the person eating banana is in an odd position (1 or 3). From clue 6, we also know that the person eating banana is on the left or right of the person watching thriller movies.


From clue 13, we know the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left of the fan of metal. Combining this with clue 3, we can conclude that the person watching thriller movies must be in position 2.


Clue 5 tells us the person driving the bus is on the far left or far right. Clue 14 reveals that the person who's sport is skiing is the person driving the bus. Given that the person eating banana is in an odd position, I placed the bus driver (skiing) in position 3.


From clue 10, we know the owner of the cat is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Clue 2 places the owner of the cat between the person eating kale and the person watching action movies. Therefore, I placed the cat owner in position 2.


Clue 11 puts the fan of rock to the left of the person who's sport is skiing (bus driver). This led me to place the fan of rock in position 1.


The remaining clues helped fill in the gaps:


* Clue 8 ensures handball is not with guinea-pig.
* Clue 9 separates baking from comedy movies.
* Clue 7 places collecting to the left of guinea-pig.
* Clue 12 places comedy movies next to blueberry.

#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* Clue 4 tells us that the person eating raspberry is on the far right, so we can start by placing ""raspberry"" in column 3.
* Clue 6 tells us that the person who's sport is skiing is the chef, and clue 7 says they're between the owner of the horse and the lizard. Since the person eating raspberry is already placed, we can put the chef (skiing) in column 1 or 2. We'll place them in column 1 for now.
* Clue 11 tells us that the social-worker is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skiing (the chef). Since the social-worker isn't the chef, we can put them in column 2.
* Clue 5 says the person eating lettuce is between the security-guard and the person who's sport is parkour. We'll place ""lettuce"" in column 2 for now.
* Clues 8 and 9 give us some constraints on the music genres and sports, but we can start by placing the fan of country (column 1 or 2) and the fan of r&b (column 2 or 3). We'll put ""country"" in column 2 and ""r&b"" in column 3 for now.
* Clue 10 tells us that the person who's sport is lacrosse is to the left of the person watching family movies. Since we already have a sports movie (sports) in column 1, we can put ""family"" in column 2 and ""lacrosse"" in column 1 or 2. We'll place it in column 2.
* Clue 3 tells us that the chef is to the left of the person watching sports movies, so we can confirm the placement of the chef (skiing) in column 1.
* Clues 1 and 7 give us some constraints on the pets, but we can start by placing ""lizard"" in column 1, ""hamster"" in column 2, and ""horse"" in column 3.
* Finally, clue 2 tells us that the fan of r&b is to the left of the person driving the snowmobile. We'll place ""snowmobile"" in column 3.

1. From clue 11, we know that tennis is on the right of Mirinda.
2. From clue 3 and 8, we can deduce that the firefighter is next to the person drinking sprite (on either side).
3. Since the paramedic is somewhere to the right of the person drinking sprite (clue 6), and not Brazilian (clue 10), it must be in position 1.
4. With the firefighter next to sprite, we can place snowboarding on the right or left of the firefighter (clue 3).
5. From clue 2, the Brazilian is on either side of Spanish, so they must be in positions 2 and 3.
6. The person who's hobby is hiking is somewhere between tennis and American (clue 9), which places it next to the American.
7. Since the owner of the pony is the dancer (clue 5), and not eating zucchini (clue 1), we can place the artichoke eater in position 3, who is Brazilian.
8. From clue 4, the person who's hobby is hiking is on the left of the owner of the bird.

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:


* From clue 4, we know the fan of house is on the far left. This gives us a starting point.
* Clue 1 tells us that the person who likes video-games is to the left of the fan of r&b. Since there are only three columns, this means the fan of r&b must be in column 3.
* Clue 2 states that the person eating plum is in an odd position. This means they can only be in column 1 or 3. But since the fan of house is already in column 1, the plum eater must be in column 3.
* We can now use clue 9 to place the collector in column 2, as they are to the right of the video-games enthusiast.
* Clue 10 tells us that the social-worker is on the right of the photographer. This means the photographer must be in column 1 or 2. Since the videographer is already in column 3 (because of clue 13), the photographer must be in column 1, and the social-worker must be in column 2.
* Clue 7 states that the egyptian is to the left of the person eating zucchini. This means the egyptian can only be in column 1 or 2. But since the chinese is already in column 1 (because of clue 3), the egyptian must be in column 2.
* Clue 8 tells us that the owner of the frog is to the left of the bird owner. This means the frog owner must be in column 1 or 2, and the bird owner must be in column 2 or 3.
* From clue 5, we know the chinchilla owner (the only pet left) must be in column 3.
* Clue 12 states that the pear eater is to the left of the skateboarding enthusiast. This means the pear eater must be in column 1.
* Finally, clue 11 tells us that the skydiving enthusiast is also a water-polo player. We can now place this person in column 3, and the parkour enthusiast must be in column 2.
