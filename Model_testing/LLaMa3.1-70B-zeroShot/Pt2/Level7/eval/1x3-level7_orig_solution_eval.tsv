Lv7-1x3-1	"Based on the given clues:


1. The fan of metal is somewhere to the right of the fan of house.
2. The fan of metal is somewhere between the fan of house and the fan of jazz.


From clue 2, we know that the order must be: house - metal - jazz (since metal is between house and jazz)


Now, let's fill in the table:


|               |   1   |   2   |  3   |
| Music-Genre   |       |       |      |

Since the fan of metal is to the right of the fan of house, we can place them as follows:


|               |   1   |   2   |  3   |
| Music-Genre   | House | Metal | Jazz |


So, the final solution table with '#############' around it is:


#############
|               |   1   |   2   |  3   |
| Music-Genre   | House | Metal | Jazz |

Lv7-1x3-2	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person driving the trike is between the person driving the train and the person driving the boat.
2. The person driving the train is to the right of the person driving the boat.

From clue 2, we know the order is Boat -> Train (with possibly something in between).

Now, let's incorporate clue 1. Since the trike driver is between the boat and train drivers, the order must be:

Boat -> Trike -> Train

So, the solution is:


#############
|             |  1   |   2   |   3   |
| Transport   | Boat | Trike | Train |

Lv7-1x3-3	"Based on the clues, here's the solution:

| Movie-Genre   |         |           |        |

From clue 2, we know that romance is to the left of animation.

So, the possible order is: Romance - Animation - ?

From clue 1, we know that animation is between romance and zombie. Since romance is already on the left, zombie must be on the right.

Therefore, the final solution is:


#############

Lv7-1x3-4	"Let's break down the clues:

From clue 2, we know that the person eating peas is on the far right, which means they are in position 3.

From clue 1, we know that the person eating nectarine is between the person eating peas and the person eating asparagus. Since peas is already in position 3, this means that asparagus must be in position 1, and nectarine must be in position 2.

Here is the final solution table:


#############

Lv7-1x3-5	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|            |   1   |    2    |       3       |
| Beverage   | Water | Mirinda | Hot-Chocolate|
#############


Here's how the clues lead to this solution:

* Clue 1: The person drinking mirinda is between the person drinking hot-chocolate and the person drinking water.
	+ This means mirinda cannot be in position 1 or 3, so it must be in position 2.
* Clue 2: The person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
	+ Since mirinda is already in position 2, water must be in position 1.
* Clue 3: This clue is redundant and doesn't provide any new information.

With these clues, we can conclude that the final order is Water, Mirinda, and Hot-Chocolate."	{'beverage': ['water', 'mirinda', 'hot-chocolate']}	True	3	True

| Transport   |           |     |      |

From clue 2, we know that the person driving the bus is to the right of the person driving the quad-bike. This means the quad-bike must be in position 1 and the bus in either position 2 or 3.

From clue 1, we know that the bus is between the quad-bike and the tram. Since the quad-bike is already in position 1, the bus must be in position 2, and the tram in position 3.

Lv7-1x3-7	"Based on the clues:

Clue 1: The entrepreneur is somewhere to the right of the engineer.
This means that the engineer cannot be in column 3, because there would be no space for the entrepreneur to the right.

Clue 2: The engineer is somewhere between the entrepreneur and the manager.
This means that the entrepreneur must be on one side of the engineer, and the manager must be on the other side.

From Clue 1, we know the engineer cannot be in column 3. So, let's put the engineer in column 2 (for now).

If the engineer is in column 2, then the entrepreneur must be to the right, which means the entrepreneur is in column 3 (by Clue 1). The manager must be on the other side of the engineer (by Clue 2), so the manager is in column 1.

Here is the final solution:


|       |    1    |    2     |      3       |
| Job   | Manager | Engineer | Entrepreneur |

Lv7-1x3-8	"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The person drinking fanta is between the person drinking soy-milk and the person drinking almond-milk.
2. The person drinking soy-milk is to the left of the person drinking almond-milk.

From clue 2, we know that soy-milk must be in position 1 or 2, since it's to the left of almond-milk.

Now, let's consider clue 1: Fanta is between soy-milk and almond-milk. Since soy-milk is already placed in one of the first two positions, fanta must be in the middle (position 2).

Almond-milk can only fit in position 3, as it's to the right of both soy-milk and fanta.

So, here's the final solution:

#############
|            |    1     |   2   |      3      |

Lv7-1x3-9	"Let's break down the clues:


Clue 1: The fan of d&b is on the right of the fan of soul.
This means the order must be: ... , Soul, D&B, ...

Clue 2: The fan of soul is somewhere between the fan of d&b and the fan of reggae.
Since we already know the order from Clue 1 (Soul, D&B), this clue tells us that Reggae must come before Soul.

So, the final order is:

Lv7-1x3-10	"Based on the given clues, we can deduce that:


* The person driving the motorbike is to the left of the person driving the ship (Clue 1), so the ship cannot be in position 1.
* The person driving the motorbike is between the person driving the quad-bike and the person driving the ship (Clue 2). Since the motorbike is already determined to be to the left of the ship, the quad-bike must be on the left side of the motorbike.


Therefore, the final solution table is:
