Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* Clues 2, 8, and 16 helped establish the transport order: Boat on the far left, Roller in an even position (2), and Motorbike on the far right.
* Clue 13 linked Lime to Puzzles, while clue 25 linked Spinach to Chess. These two clues helped place the Hobby column.
* Clues 4, 12, and 28 established the Pet order: Rat and Goat around Mouse, with Bird in position 5 (Airplane) due to clue 23.
* Clue 26 placed Funk on the right of Pear, which was linked to Puzzles by clue 13. This helped place the Music-Genre column.
* The remaining clues were used to fill in the gaps and ensure consistency across all columns.

#############

Note: The solution is based on the given clues and some deductions:

* From clue 24, the person driving the ship is in the middle, so it's position 3.
* From clue 27, the person driving the ship is the person who's hobby is video-games, so it's video-games at position 3 (and also food plum).
* From clue 10, the person eating carrot is somewhere to the right of the fan of ambient, and from clue 18, the fan of ambient is the person driving the taxi. So, the person eating carrot must be on the right side of taxi.
* From clue 17, the person eating carrot is somewhere to the left of the person eating cranberry, so the order is: ..., carrot, cranberry
* From clue 20, the photographer is somewhere between the person eating plum and the person eating nectarine. Since plum is in position 3 (odd), the photographer must be on either side of it.
* Clue 21 states that the person driving the boat is in an even position. The only even positions left are 2 and 4, but since the engineer is on the left or right of the person eating plum (clue 6), the boat driver cannot be at position 4 (because then it would not have a neighbor). So, the boat driver must be at position 2.
* Clue 9 states that the person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is chess. Since the photographer is between plum and nectarine, the only possibility for helicopter driver being on the right side of chess is if the chess player is at position 1.
* From clue 26, the fan of gospel is the person watching horror movies, and since the fan of trance is somewhere to the left of the fan of funk (clue 5), it's likely that the fan of trance is also on the left side. 
* Clue 22 states that the librarian is on the right of the person driving the helicopter, so it must be at position 4.
* From clue 14, the librarian is somewhere to the right of the person watching spy movies, and since the engineer is already placed (next to plum), the only possibility for this is if the spy movie fan is at position 2 or left side."	{'food': ['asparagus', 'nectarine', 'plum', 'cranberry', 'carrot'], 'hobby': ['chess', 'skydiving', 'card-games', 'video-games', 'fishing'], 'job': ['engineer', 'photographer', 'librarian', 'project-manager', 'videographer'], 'movie-genre': ['satire', 'animation', 'horror', 'mystery', 'spy'], 'music-genre': ['ambient', 'trance', 'funk', 'gospel', 'soul'], 'transport': ['taxi', 'helicopter', 'ship', 'boat', 'train']}	True	12	False
