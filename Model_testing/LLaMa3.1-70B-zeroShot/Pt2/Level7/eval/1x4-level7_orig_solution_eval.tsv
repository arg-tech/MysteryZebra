Lv7-1x4-1	"Let's break down the clues:

From clue 3, we know the order is: Hamster -> Goat (since the owner of the hamster is on the left of the owner of the goat)

From clue 2, we know the order is: ... -> Snake (since the owner of the goat is between the owner of the hamster and the owner of the snake)

So far, we have:
 Hamster -> Goat -> Snake

From clue 1, we know the frog's owner is to the right of the snake's owner. Since there are only 4 pets, this means the frog must be at the end.

So, the final order is:
Hamster -> Goat -> Snake -> Frog

Here is the solution table:

Lv7-1x4-2	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person eating papaya is on the right of the person eating spinach.
This means Spinach must be to the left of Papaya.

2. The person eating papaya is somewhere between the person eating lettuce and the person eating apricot.
This means Lettuce and Apricot are at the ends, with Papaya in between.

3. The person eating papaya is between the person eating lettuce and the person eating spinach.
Since Spinach is already to the left of Papaya (from clue 1), this means the order for these three must be: Lettuce - Spinach - Papaya

Now, combining all clues:

Lettuce - Spinach - Papaya - Apricot

Here's the final solution table:


#############

Lv7-1x4-4	"Let's break down the clues:


1. The person driving the train is somewhere between the person driving the snowmobile and the person driving the jet-ski.
This means the order must be: Snowmobile, Train, Jet-ski or Jet-ski, Train, Snowmobile.

2. The person driving the bike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the train.
This means the Bike must come before the Train.

3. The person driving the bike is between the person driving the train and the person driving the snowmobile.
Since we already know the Bike comes before the Train, this clue implies that Snowmobile must come first, followed by Bike, then Train.


So, combining all clues, we get:

Lv7-1x4-5	"Let's break down the clues:

From clue 2, we know the order is: Comedy, Crime, Martial-Arts (or) Martial-Arts, Crime, Comedy

From clue 1, we know Martial-Arts is to the right of Crime.

From clue 3, we know Comedy is either left or right of Documentary.

Combining clues 2 and 1, we get: Comedy, Crime, Martial-Arts

Now, let's add Documentary. Since Comedy is between Documentary and Martial-Arts (clue 4), and Comedy is left or right of Documentary (clue 3), the only possible order is:

Documentary, Comedy, Crime, Martial-Arts

Here is the final solution table:

From clue 1, we know the order is: ..., Turkish, Colombian, Russian, ...

From clue 2, we know the Thai is between the Colombian and the Turkish.

From clue 3, we know the Thai is on the left or right of the Turkish, but since it's also to the right of the Turkish (clue 4), it must be on the right of the Turkish.

Lv7-1x4-7	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 1, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is between almond-milk and 7up.
From clue 2, we know that the person drinking fanta is between iced-tea and almond-milk.
From clue 3, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is to the right of the person drinking 7up.

Combining these clues, we can deduce the following:

* Since iced-tea is to the right of 7up (clue 3), and fanta is between iced-tea and almond-milk (clue 2), then almond-milk must be to the left of iced-tea.
* Therefore, the order from left to right is: almond-milk, fanta, iced-tea, 7up.

# Movie-Genre   |        |           |         |        |
# ---------------|--------|-----------|---------|--------|
#               | Action | Animation | Horror  | Romance |

The solution is based on the given clues:

1. The person watching action movies is in an odd position, so it must be either position 1 or 3.
2. The person watching romance movies is to the right of the person watching animation movies.
3. The person watching animation movies is between the person watching action movies and the person watching horror movies.

From clue 1, let's place Action in position 1 (it could also be in position 3, but we'll start with this possibility).

1. Action

Now, using clue 3, Animation must come after Action. We don't know if Horror comes immediately before or after Animation yet.

Action, ?, ?

Considering the placement of Romance relative to Animation from clue 2, and knowing that there are only four positions, Animation cannot be in position 4 (or else Romance would have nowhere to go). Therefore, let's place Animation in either position 2 or 3. If we put it in position 2:

Action, Animation

Now, from clue 3, Horror must come after Animation. This means the order so far is Action, Animation, Horror.

Action, Animation, Horror

This leaves Romance to be placed in position 4, as per clue 2 (it has to be to the right of Animation).

Therefore, one possible arrangement that satisfies all conditions is:

#               |   1    |     2     |    3    |   4    |
# Movie-Genre   |        |           |         |        |
# ---------------|--------|-----------|---------|--------|
#               | Action | Animation | Horror  | Romance |

However, remember that from clue 1, Action could also be in position 3. Let's explore this possibility.

If Action were in position 3:

?, ?, Action, ?

Given that Animation must come between Action and Horror (clue 3), and considering the constraint on Romance being to the right of Animation (clue 2), it becomes apparent that our initial solution actually covers all possible arrangements because swapping the positions of Action and another genre without violating clue 1 would necessitate rearranging the other genres in a way that contradicts clues 2 or 3.

Thus, considering all constraints, the arrangement provided initially stands as the solution."	{}	False	0	False
Lv7-1x4-9	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 1, the person driving the subway is on the far left or far right, so we can place it in column 1 or column 4.

From clue 2, the person driving the van is to the right of the person driving the helicopter. This means the helicopter cannot be in column 4 (because there's no space to the right for the van).

From clue 3, the person driving the scooter is to the right of the person driving the van.

From clue 4, the person driving the van is between the person driving the scooter and the person driving the subway. This means the van cannot be in column 1 (because there's no space to the left for either the scooter or the subway).

Putting it all together:

If the subway is on the far right (column 4), we can't satisfy clue 2, so the subway must be on the far left (column 1).

The helicopter cannot be in column 4, and since the van needs to be between the scooter and the subway, it makes sense for the helicopter to be in column 3.

Now we have:

|             |   1    |     2      |  3  |    4    |
| Transport   | Subway |            | Helicopter |         |

The van needs to be between the scooter and the subway, so it must be in column 2. And since the scooter is to the right of the van, it must be in column 4.

Final solution:

Lv7-1x4-10	"Based on the clues, we can deduce the following:


* The chef is on the left of the dancer (clue 3)
* The dancer is on the left of the analyst (clue 2)
* So, the order from left to right is: chef, dancer, analyst
* The analyst is somewhere between the fisherman and the chef (clue 1), but since the analyst is already to the right of the chef, this means the fisherman must be to the right of the analyst.
* Therefore, the complete order is: chef, dancer, analyst, fisherman
