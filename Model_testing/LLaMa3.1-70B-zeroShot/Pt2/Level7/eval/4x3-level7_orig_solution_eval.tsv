Lv7-4x3-1	"Let's break down the clues step by step:


From clue 2, we know the person who's sport is basketball is in the middle.


|               |      1      |      Basketball       |    3     |
| Hobby         |             |              |          |
| Movie-Genre   |             |              |          |
| Sport         |             |              |          |
| Transport     |             |              |          |

From clue 3, we know the person who's sport is basketball is on the right of the person driving the boat.


|               |      Boat      |      Basketball       |    3     |
| Hobby         |             |              |          |

| Transport     |             |              |          |

From clue 4, we know the person driving the helicopter is between the person who's sport is cycling and the person watching thriller movies.


Since basketball is in the middle, and boat is on the left of basketball, helicopter must be on the right of basketball. Also, since surfing is to the right of fantasy (clue 1), and surfing can't be with basketball (because it would make surfing not on the right of fantasy), surfing must be on the right.


|               |      Boat      |      Basketball       |    Helicopter     |
| Hobby         |             |              |          Surfing |

| Transport     |             |              |          |

From clue 1, we know the person watching fantasy movies is to the left of the person who's sport is surfing.


Since surfing is on the right, fantasy must be in column 2 (because it can't be on the same side as surfing).


|               |      Boat      |    Fantasy     Basketball       |    Helicopter     Surfing |

| Transport     |             |              |          |

From clue 4, we know the person driving the helicopter is between the person who's sport is cycling and the person watching thriller movies.


Since surfing is on the right, and fantasy is in column 2, the only option left for cycling is column 1 (because it can't be with surfing or basketball).


|               |      Boat Cycling     |    Fantasy     Basketball       |    Helicopter     Surfing |

| Sport         |             |              |          |
| Transport     |             |              |          |

From clue 5, we know the person watching fantasy movies is not the person who's hobby is fishing.


The only hobbies left are magic-tricks and photography. Fantasy can't be with photography (because then disaster would have to be between fishing and fantasy), so fantasy must be with magic-tricks.


|               |      Boat Cycling     Fishing |    Fantasy Magic-Tricks Basketball       |    Helicopter     Surfing Photography |

| Transport     |             |              |          |

From clue 6, we know the person watching disaster movies is between the person who's hobby is fishing and the person who's hobby is photography.


The only option left for disaster is column 2 (because it can't be with surfing or fantasy).


Since fantasy is in column 2, disaster must be with column 1.

| Transport     |             |              |          |

The only hobby left is photography, which must be with surfing.

The only movie-genre left is disaster, which must be with cycling.

| Transport     |             |              |          |

The only sport left is cycling, which must be with boat.

| Transport     |             Boat |              Van |          Helicopter|

The only transport left is van, which must be with fantasy.

Lv7-4x3-2	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############

|               |    1    |     2     |    3    |
| Movie-Genre   | Mystery | Western  | Horror  |
| Music-Genre   | Funk    | Techno  | Hip-Hop |
| Pet           | Ferret  | Hamster | Cat      |
| Sport         | Golf    | Tennis  | Badminton|

#############


Let's go through the reasoning:

From clue 2, we know Western is to the right of Mystery.

From clue 3, we know the person watching Western owns a hamster.

From clue 5, we know Western is to the right of Horror.

So, the order for Movie-Genre is: Mystery, Western, Horror (or Horror, Mystery, Western).

Now, let's consider Music-Genre. From clue 1, we know Hip-Hop is paired with Horror.

From clue 6, we know Techno is in the middle.

Since Western is to the right of Mystery and Horror, it can't be paired with Techno (which is in the middle). Therefore, Funk must be paired with Mystery.

Now, let's consider Pet. From clue 4, we know Cat is between Golf and Tennis.

From clue 7, we know Ferret is paired with Golf.

Since Western is to the right of Horror, Hamster can't be paired with Golf or Tennis (as it would contradict clue 4). Therefore, Hamster must be paired with Western.

The only remaining pet is Cat, which must be paired with Badminton (the only remaining sport).

So, we have:

Lv7-4x3-3	"Based on the given clues, I'll solve the puzzle step by step.


From clue 1, we know that the person whose hobby is collecting watches mystery movies.

From clue 2 and 5, we can deduce that the manager is to the left of the person watching adventure movies.

From clue 3 and 4, we know that the teacher is not the rock-climber, but the rock-climber is to the left of the teacher.


Now, let's analyze the beverage clues. From clue 6, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is between the rock-climber and the almond-milk drinker.

From clue 7, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is also between the manager and the collector.


Considering all these clues together, I'll construct the solution table:

Lv7-4x3-4	"Let's analyze the clues and fill in the table step by step.


From clue 3, we know that the person who's hobby is baking is the fan of classical music.


From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left or right of the fan of classical. Since there are only three columns, this means the puzzle enthusiast must be in column 1 and the baker (classical music fan) must be in column 2 or 3.


From clue 7, we know that the person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the fan of classical. This means the water drinker must be in column 1.


From clue 5, we know that the person who's hobby is baking (classical music fan) is on the left or right of the person drinking water. Since the baker can't be in column 1 (because of clue 7), this means the baker must be in column 3.


Now we have:


|               |      1      |     2     |      3       |
| Beverage      | Water      |           |              |

| Sport         |            |           |              |


From clue 2, we know that the person who's hobby is baking (column 3) is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is video-games. This means the video-gamer must be in column 1 or 2.


But from our previous deductions, we already have someone in column 1 (puzzle enthusiast), so the video-gamer must be in column 2.


|               |      1      |     2     |      3       |
| Beverage      | Water      |           |              |

| Sport         |            |           |              |


From clue 6, we know that the person who's sport is tennis is somewhere between the fan of gospel and the person who's hobby is video-games. This means the gospel music fan must be in column 1 (with puzzles), and the tennis player must be in column 2.


|               |      1      |     2     |      3       |

From clue 4, we know that the person who's sport is volleyball is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. This means the volleyball player must be in column 1 (with puzzles and gospel), and the snowboarder must be in column 2 or 3.


But from our previous deductions, we already have someone in column 2 (video-gamer with tennis), so the snowboarder must be in column 3.


|               |      1      |     2     |      3       |
| Beverage      | Water      |           |              |

| Music-Genre   | Gospel     |           | Classical     |
| Sport         | Volleyball| Tennis    | Snowboarding |

From clue 8, we know that the person who's sport is tennis is on the left of the person drinking milk. This means the milk drinker must be in column 3.


|               |      1      |     2     |      3       |
| Beverage      | Water      |           | Milk         |
| Hobby         | Puzzles    | Video-games| Baking (Classical)|
| Music-Genre   | Gospel     |           | Classical     |
| Sport         | Volleyball| Tennis    | Snowboarding |

The only beverage left is juice, so the person drinking juice must be in column 2.


|               |      1      |     2     |      3       |
| Beverage      | Water      | Juice     | Milk         |

| Music-Genre   | Gospel     | Metal     | Classical     |
| Sport         | Volleyball| Tennis    | Snowboarding |

The only music-genre left is metal, so it must be in column 2.


Here's the final solution:

| Food          | Eggplant | Strawberry  | Pumpkin  |

| Nationality   | British   | Japanese    | Egyptian  |
| Sport         | Skiing    | Snowboarding| Surfing   |

Let me explain my reasoning:


From clue 4, we know the person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the fan of classical. So, the fan of classical must be in column 2.


Clue 7 tells us that the person eating eggplant is on the left of the Japanese. Since the British is either on the left or right of the Japanese (clue 6), and the Egyptian is to the right of the British (clue 2), we can deduce that the order for Nationality is: British, Japanese, Egyptian.


Clue 5 tells us that the person eating strawberry is on the left or right of the person eating pumpkin. Since the eggplant is already in column 1, and the pumpkin cannot be in column 1 (due to clue 7), we can deduce that the order for Food is: Eggplant, Strawberry, Pumpkin.


Clue 3 tells us that the fan of salsa is not the person eating pumpkin. So, the fan of salsa must be either in column 1 or column 2. But since the fan of classical is already in column 2, we can deduce that the fan of salsa is in column 1.


Finally, clue 1 tells us that the person who's sport is snowboarding is between the person who's sport is skiing and the person eating pumpkin. So, the order for Sport must be: Skiing, Snowboarding, Surfing (since surfing cannot be in column 2 due to clue 4).


Putting it all together, we get:

| Sport         | baseball    | surfing     | climbing   |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 6, we know the architect is the person who's sport is climbing. Clue 2 tells us that the electrician is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is climbing, so the electrician must be in column 1.

Clue 3 states that the designer is the owner of the hamster. Clue 8 says that the owner of the goat is not the designer, so the designer can't be in column 1 (since the electrician is there). Therefore, the designer is in column 2 or 3.

Clue 4 tells us that the designer is on the left or right of the person watching spy movies. Since the designer is in column 2 or 3, and the architect (climbing) is in column 3, the designer must be in column 2.

Now we know that the electrician is in column 1, the designer is in column 2, and the architect is in column 3.

Clue 1 says that the person who's sport is baseball is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing. This means that the person watching baseball must be in column 1 (since surfing can't be in column 1), and surfing must be in column 2 or 3. But we already know the designer is in column 2, so surfing must be in column 2 as well.

From clue 5, we know that the person watching spy movies is somewhere between the person watching drama movies and the owner of the rat. Clue 7 states that the person watching family movies is to the right of the person watching drama movies. This means that drama must be in column 1 or 2, and family must be in column 3.

Since the electrician is in column 1 and baseball is also in column 1 (from clue 1), drama can't be in column 1 (otherwise, there would be no room for spy movies). So drama is in column 1 is ruled out. Therefore, drama is in column 2 or not at all.

But we know the designer is in column 2 and is on the left or right of the person watching spy movies. This means that drama can't be in column 2 either (otherwise, there would be no room for spy movies). So drama must be in column 1 after all!

Now that we have drama in column 1, family must be in column 3 (from clue 7).

We also know that the person watching spy movies is somewhere between the person watching drama movies and the owner of the rat. Since drama is in column 1 and family is in column 3, spy must be in column 2.

Finally, we can determine the pets: since the designer owns a hamster (clue 3), and the designer is in column 2, hamster goes to column 2 as well. The owner of the goat is not the designer (clue 8), so goat must go to column 1. This leaves rat for column 3.

Lv7-4x3-7	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a possible solution:


|               |    1    |        2        |    3     |
| Job           |         |                 |          |
| Movie-Genre   |         |                 |          |

| Sport         |         |                 |          |

Here's my step-by-step reasoning:

From clue 1, the fan of ambient is on the far left. This gives us:


|               |    1    |        2        |    3     |
| Job           |         |                 |          |
| Movie-Genre   |         |                 |          |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient |                 |          |
| Sport         |         |                 |          |

From clue 3, the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the fan of metal. Since ambient is already on the far left, this means that either:

* Skateboarding is in column 2 and Metal is in column 1 (but this contradicts clue 1, so we reject it)
* Skateboarding is in column 1 and Metal is in column 2
* Metal is in column 3

So, for now, let's leave the skateboarding and metal columns open:


|               |    1    |        2        |    3     |
| Job           |         |                 |          |
| Movie-Genre   |         |                 |          |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient | Metal?         | Metal?  |
| Sport         | Sk8?   |                |          |

From clue 4, the fan of metal is not the project-manager. This means that either:

* The musician is in column 2 (and therefore also enjoys Metal)
* The coach or project-manager is in column 3

Let's come back to this later.

From clue 5, the person watching comedy movies is somewhere between the coach and the person watching spy movies. This gives us a constraint on the movie-genre order:


|               |    1    |        2        |    3     |
| Job           |         |                 |          |
| Movie-Genre   | ?      | Comedy?       | Spy?    |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient | Metal?         | Metal?  |
| Sport         | Sk8?   |                |          |

From clue 6, the person watching comedy movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching spy movies. This further constrains the movie-genre order:


|               |    1    |        2        |    3     |
| Job           |         |                 |          |
| Movie-Genre   | ?      | Comedy?       | Spy    |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient | Metal?         | Metal?  |
| Sport         | Sk8?   |                |          |

From clue 7, the person watching comedy movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is soccer. This gives us:


|               |    1    |        2        |    3     |
| Job           |         |                 |          |
| Movie-Genre   | ?      | Comedy?       | Spy    |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient | Metal?         | Metal?  |
| Sport         | Soccer | Sk8?          |          |

Now, let's revisit clue 4. If the musician is in column 2 (and therefore also enjoys Metal), this would mean that the coach or project-manager is not in column 2 (since they can't enjoy both comedy and metal). However, this creates a problem with clue 5, since we can't have the person watching comedy movies between the coach and the person watching spy movies.

So, instead, let's assume that the musician is not in column 2. This means that either:

* The musician is in column 1 (but this would mean they enjoy ambient, which doesn't fit with clue 4)
* The musician is in column 3

This gives us:


|               |    1    |        2        |    3     |
| Job           |         |                 | Musician|
| Movie-Genre   | ?      | Comedy?       | Spy    |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient | Metal          |          |
| Sport         | Soccer | Sk8?          | Tennis |

Finally, let's fill in the remaining gaps:


|               |    1    |        2        |    3     |
| Job           | Coach  | Project-Manager| Musician|
| Movie-Genre   | Epic   | Comedy       | Spy    |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient | Metal          |          |
| Sport         | Soccer | Sk8?          | Tennis |

However, this would mean that the person who's sport is skateboarding is not to the left or right of the fan of metal (contradicting clue 3). So, let's swap the coach and project-manager:


|               |    1    |        2        |    3     |
| Job           | Project-Manager| Coach       | Musician|
| Movie-Genre   | Epic   | Comedy       | Spy    |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient | Metal          |          |
| Sport         | Soccer | Sk8?          | Tennis |

This looks good! However, we still need to fix the sport column:


|               |    1    |        2        |    3     |
| Job           | Project-Manager| Coach       | Musician|
| Movie-Genre   | Epic   | Comedy       | Spy    |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient | Metal          |          |
| Sport         | Soccer | Sk8          | Tennis |

This finally satisfies all the clues!

From clue 3, we know the Australian is on the far right:

From clue 6, we know the bartender is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading:

From clue 5, we know the videographer is somewhere between the person who's hobby is skydiving and the bartender:

| Nationality   |           |              | Australian |

From clue 4, we know the Russian is not the person who's hobby is reading. Since the architect can't be on the far right (Australian), and there are only two remaining spots for nationalities, the Russian must be in spot #2:


|               |     1     |      2       |     3      |
| Hobby         | Reading    | Skydiving    |            |

| Movie-Genre   |           |              | Fantasy    |
| Nationality   | Indian     | Russian      | Australian |

From clue 2, we know the person watching family movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since the person in spot #1 has a hobby (reading), they can't watch family movies (clue 1 would contradict). Therefore, the person watching family movies must be in spot #2:


|               |     1     |      2       |     3      |

Finally, from clue 1, we know the person watching fantasy movies is the bartender:

From clue 2, the person who's hobby is hiking can only be on the far left or far right. Let's assume it's on the far left for now.

From clue 1, the person who's hobby is traveling is to the right of the person whose sport is water-polo. This means the person with water-polo cannot be on the far right.

| Nationality   | italian    | dutch       | brazilian|
| Sport         | water-polo | parkour     | soccer    |
#############

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 6, we know the Brazilian is to the left of the person who likes soccer. Since there are only three positions, this means the Brazilian must be in position 2 or 1.

From clue 5 (which is a duplicate of clue 4), we know the salsa fan is to the right of the hip-hop fan.

From clue 2, we know the hip-hop fan is on either side of the writing hobbyist. Since the salsa fan is to the right of the hip-hop fan, this means the hip-hop fan must be in position 1 or 2, and the writing hobbyist must be in position 2.

Now, from clue 1, we know the person who likes soccer is to the left of the writing hobbyist. This means the soccer fan cannot be in position 3 (because then there would be no one to the right of them), so they must be in position 1 or 2. But if they were in position 1, the Brazilian would have to be to their left, which is impossible since there's no one to the left of position 1! Therefore, the soccer fan must be in position 2, and the writing hobbyist must be in position 3.

From clue 3, we know the woodworking hobbyist is between the Dutch person and the water-polo enthusiast. Since the Dutch person cannot be in position 1 (because then there would be no one to their left), they must be in position 2 or 3. But if they were in position 2, the soccer fan would have to be between them and the writing hobbyist, which is impossible! Therefore, the Dutch person must be in position 1 or 3.

Putting it all together, we get:

* Position 1: Italian (because Brazilian is to their right), hip-hop fan
* Position 2: Dutch (to satisfy clue 3), soccer fan, rock music fan
* Position 3: Brazilian (to satisfy clue 6), writing hobbyist, salsa fan

However, this doesn't quite work, because then the woodworking hobbyist would be on either side of the Italian and the water-polo enthusiast, which isn't possible.

Wait a minute... what if we swap positions 1 and 2?

* Position 1: Dutch (to satisfy clue 3), writing hobbyist, hip-hop fan
* Position 2: Italian (because Brazilian is to their right), woodworking hobbyist, rock music fan
* Position 3: Brazilian (to satisfy clue 6), filmmaking hobbyist, salsa fan

And then we can use the remaining clues to fill in the rest:

* Water-polo enthusiast must be in position 1, because that's the only place left for them.
* Parkour enthusiast must be in position 2, because they're not in positions 1 or 3.
* Soccer fan must be in position 3, because that's the only place left for them.

And that's how we arrive at the final solution!"	{'hobby': ['writing', 'woodworking', 'filmmaking'], 'music-genre': ['hip-hop', 'rock', 'salsa'], 'nationality': ['italian', 'dutch', 'brazilian'], 'sport': ['water-polo', 'parkour', 'soccer']}	True	3	False
