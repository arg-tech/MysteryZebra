Note: I used ""mystery-analyst"" to indicate that the analyst's favorite movie genre is mystery, as stated in clue 15. Similarly, I used ""thriller"", ""time-travel"", etc. to indicate the favorite movie genres of the other individuals.

The solution was obtained by carefully analyzing and combining the given clues. Some key steps involved:

* Using clue 3 to determine that the person watching thriller movies is between the person driving the scooter (clue 2) and the person driving the jet-ski (clue 10).
* Using clue 6 to determine that the person eating lettuce is the engineer, and then using clue 5 to determine that the person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the person eating lettuce.
* Using clue 12 to determine that the owner of the ferret is the person who's sport is parkour, and then using clue 17 to determine that the owner of the ferret is in the middle (position 3).
* Using clue 15 to determine that the person watching mystery movies is on the far left or far right. Since the person driving the scooter (clue 2) is already in position 1, it follows that the person watching mystery movies must be in position 5.
* Using clue 28 to determine that the person drinking mirinda is the person watching horror movies, and then using clue 13 to determine that the person watching horror movies is on the far right (position 5).

These steps, along with careful analysis of the remaining clues, ultimately led to the solution above."	{'sport': ['', '', '', '', ''], 'transport': ['', '', '', '', '']}	False	0	False

#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:


The clues were used to build up the table row by row. The key was to use the more restrictive clues first and then fill in the gaps with the less restrictive ones.


Some notable steps include:


* Clue 1 places the person drinking 7up on the left of the owner of the frog.
* Clues 2 and 12 place the chinese to the right of the british, and the mexican is in an odd position (4).
* Clues 5 and 13 place the car driver in an odd position, which must be 1 or 3. But clue 15 places the person drinking almond-milk on the left of the person who's hobby is writing, so the car driver can't be in position 1.
* Clue 20 places the potato eater in an odd position (4), and clue 10 eliminates lemonade as a possibility for this person. This leaves milk as the only option for the beverage in position 5.

Here's the explanation of the solution:

The puzzle was solved by using a combination of logical deductions and elimination techniques. The clues were analyzed one by one, and the possible options were narrowed down until the correct solution was found.

Some key deductions that helped solve the puzzle include:

* Clue 21: The person watching animation movies is in an even position.
* Clue 10: The person watching animation movies is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
* Clue 5: The fan of country is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is parkour.
* Clue 34: The person who's sport is skiing is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton.

These clues helped establish the positions of the animation movies, hot-chocolate, country music, and skiing/badminton sports.

The rest of the puzzle was solved by using similar logical deductions and elimination techniques.

Here's a brief explanation of the steps to solve the puzzle:

* Start with clue 17, which states that the librarian is driving the snowmobile. This allows us to place the librarian in column 3.
* Use clue 5 to place the person watching tennis on either side of the librarian. Since the person watching tennis can't be in column 1 (due to clue 32), we place them in column 4.
* Clue 11 states that the person watching cycling is on either side of the librarian. We place them in column 2, as they can't be in column 5 (due to clue 4).
* Use clue 14 to place the car driver on either side of the snowmobile driver. Since the car driver can't be in column 1 (due to clue 32), we place them in column 2.
* Clue 10 states that the analyst is somewhere to the right of the skateboard driver. We place the analyst in column 4, as they can't be in column 5 (due to clue 27).
* Continue using the remaining clues to fill in the rest of the table.
