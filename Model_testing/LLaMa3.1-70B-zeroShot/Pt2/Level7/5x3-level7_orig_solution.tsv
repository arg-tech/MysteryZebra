Lv7-5x3-1	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |        1        |     2      |      3      |
| Food          | onion           | cabbage    | spinach     |
| Hobby         | fishing         | dancing    | board-games |
| Job           | project-manager | manager    | journalist  |
| Music-Genre   | dubstep         | electronic | folk        |
| Nationality   | thai            | chinese    | american    |


Here's how the clues led me to this solution:


* From clue 8, we know the project-manager is on the far left.
* Clue 1 suggests that the person eating onion is on the far left or far right. Since the project-manager is already on the far left, the person eating onion must be on the far left as well (column 1).
* From clue 10, we know the person eating onion is to the left of the person who's hobby is fishing. So, fishing must be in column 2.
* Clue 3 and 5 suggest that dancing is to the left of folk, and fishing is also to the left of folk. Since folk can only be in column 3 (because it's the american), dancing must be in column 2 as well.
* However, we already have fishing in column 2, so dancing must be in column 1 or 3. But clue 5 says that the person who's hobby is fishing is to the left of folk, and since folk is in column 3, fishing cannot be in column 1 (it would not be to the left of folk). So, dancing must be in column 3.
* Wait! We can't have dancing in column 3 because it needs to be to the left of folk. This means that clue 5 was a bit misleading - fishing doesn't need to be directly next to folk. The correct order is: fishing (column 1 or 2), and then folk (column 3).
* Now we can resolve this by placing dancing in column 1, and fishing in column 2.
* From clue 6, we know that cabbage is between dubstep and american. Since the american is in column 3 (folk), cabbage must be in column 2.
* Clue 2 says that cabbage is to the left or right of the manager. The only available spot for the manager is column 2.
* Clue 4 tells us that chinese is in the middle, so chinese must be in column 2 as well (as the nationality).
* Clue 7 tells us that folk is american, which we already figured out.
* Finally, from clue 9, journalist can only fit in column 3.

Please let me know if this solution satisfies all the clues!

Lv7-5x3-2	"After analyzing the given clues, I've come up with a solution that fits all the conditions:

| Pet           | Ferret      | Mouse     | Dog      |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 6, the person watching thriller movies is drinking tea, so column 3 is set for Movie-Genre and Beverage.
* Clue 7 places the librarian on the left of the Japanese, which means column 1 is for Job and Nationality.
* Clues 2 and 5 imply that the American is not in column 1 or 2, so column 3 must be for the American.
* The analyst (clue 4) must be between the person drinking juice and the engineer, placing the analyst in column 2.
* Clue 9 forces the dog owner to be either in column 1 or 3. However, since the person watching horror movies is on the left or right of the person drinking tea (clue 1), and the American can't watch horror movies, the dog must belong to the engineer in column 3.
* The mouse's owner (clues 3 and 7) must be between the juice drinker and the tea drinker. This places the mouse in column 2.
* Finally, with all other options taken, the ferret belongs to the librarian in column 1.

Let's assume that the person who's sport is handball is in column 2 (we can always swap columns later if necessary).

Lv7-5x3-4	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:

| Transport   | bus           | subway        | van        |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 8, we know the owner of the horse is on the far left.
* From clue 1, the person eating pear is to the left of the person eating raspberry. Since there are only three positions, this means the person eating apple must be in position 1.
* From clue 3, the person drinking hot-chocolate is to the right of the person drinking milk. This means milk must be in position 1.
* From clue 6, the person driving the subway is in an odd position, which means they can only be in position 1 or 3. But from clue 5, we know the bus driver is to the left of the subway driver, so the subway driver must be in position 2.
* From clue 9, the person who's sport is soccer is between the skateboarding and subway drivers. This means the soccer player must be in position 1 (but that's already taken by milk/apple/horse), or position 3 (which would put them to the right of the rugby player, contradicting clue 2). So, the soccer player must actually be in position 2.
* The remaining clues can now be used to fill in the gaps. Clue 4 tells us the lizard owner is to the right of hot-chocolate, which puts them in position 3. Clue 7 tells us the van driver eats raspberry, and from clue 1 we know the pear eater is to their left. Finally, clue 2 tells us rugby is to the right of raspberry.

Lv7-5x3-5	"Here's the solved puzzle:


|               |     1      |    2    |    3     |
| Beverage      | mirinda    | fanta   | sprite  |

| Nationality   | mexican    | spanish | french   |
| Pet           | mouse      | frog    | horse   |

Let me explain the steps to get to this solution:

1. From clue #4, we know the mechanic drinks mirinda.
2. From clue #6, we know the mexican owns a mouse.
3. Since the mexican is on the left of the person watching horror movies (clue #2), and there are only 3 columns, the mexican must be in column 1, and the person watching horror movies must be in column 2 or 3. This also means the mechanic (who drinks mirinda) is not in column 1.
4. From clue #5, we know the person drinking fanta is to the right of the mexican, so the person drinking fanta must be in column 2 or 3.
5. Since the engineer is french (clue #1), and the engineer is somewhere to the right of the person drinking sprite (clue #8), the engineer cannot be in column 1. Also, since there's only one person who drinks mirinda (the mechanic), the engineer must drink either fanta or sprite.
6. If the engineer drank fanta, then they would have to be in column 2 or 3 (since they're to the right of the person drinking sprite). But this is not possible because the mexican is already in column 1, and there's only one person who drinks mirinda (the mechanic), so the engineer can't be in column 2. So the engineer must drink sprite.
7. Since the engineer drinks sprite and is somewhere to the right of it (which doesn't make sense if they drank it themselves), this means that there must be someone else who drinks sprite, and the engineer is to their right.
8. The only column left for the person drinking mirinda (the mechanic) is column 1 or 2. But since the mexican owns a mouse (column 1), the mechanic can't be in column 1, so they must be in column 2. This means that the person watching horror movies must be in column 1.
9. From clue #3, we know the person watching action movies is between the owner of the frog and the person drinking fanta. The only way to satisfy this condition is if the person watching action movies is in column 2, the owner of the frog is in column 3, and the person drinking fanta is in column 3.
10. From clue #7, we know the person watching action movies is somewhere to the right of the person drinking mirinda (the mechanic). Since the mechanic is in column 1 or 2, this means that the person watching action movies must be in column 2 or 3.
11. The only job left for column 2 is writer, and the only nationality left for column 3 is french.

Lv7-5x3-6	"After solving the puzzle, I got the following solution:

| Transport     | jet-ski  | car           | helicopter  |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

1. From clue 2, we know that the person eating onion is on the far right (column 3).
2. From clue 6, we know that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left or right of the person driving the car. Since there are only three columns, this means that the person with the hobby of rock-climbing must be in either column 1 or 2.
3. From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the fan of indie. This means that the person with the hobby of rock-climbing must be in column 1, and the fan of indie must be in column 2 or 3.
4. From clue 7, we know that the person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the fan of country. Since the fan of indie is already in column 2 or 3, this means that the fan of country must be in column 3, and the person driving the jet-ski must be in column 1 or 2.
5. From clue 4, we know that the person drinking juice is on the right of the person eating apricot. This means that the person eating apricot cannot be in column 3 (since there's no one to their right), and therefore they must be in either column 1 or 2.
6. Putting it all together, we get:

* Column 1: rock-climbing hobbyist, eats apricot, drinks juice
* Column 2: drawing hobbyist, eats zucchini, drinks soy-milk, listens to ambient music
* Column 3: board-games hobbyist, eats onion, drinks milk, listens to country music

But this creates a problem - the person eating apricot is supposed to be on the left of the person drinking juice (from clue 4). So we need to swap columns 1 and 2:

* Column 1: drawing hobbyist doesn't work here... let's try rock-climbing hobbyist, eats apricot doesn't work either...
Wait a minute! What if the person eating apricot is in column 2? Then the person drinking juice would be in column 1!

So we get:

* Column 1: person drinking juice
* Column 2: person eating apricot
* Column 3: person eating onion

And that's when it all clicks into place!"

Combining these two clues, we can deduce that the order for column 1 is: Indian (puzzle) -> Animation.

Here's how I arrived at the solution:


From clue 4, lemonade is to the right of 7up.
From clue 8, pop is to the left of lemonade, so pop must be in column 2.


From clue 3, disco is on either side of kiwi. Since pop is already in column 2, disco must be in column 3.


From clue 1, pepper is on either side of kiwi. Given that chinese is to the right of pepper (clue 6), pepper must be in column 1.

From clue 2, basketball is to the left of mirinda. Since mirinda is in column 3, basketball must be in either column 1 or 2.

From clue 9, badminton is to the right of the nigerian. Since the nigerian is in column 2, badminton must be in column 3 or on the right end. But we already have snowboarding as a possibility for column 3 (since basketball can't be there). Therefore, badminton must be in column 1.


Now we have:


|               |      1       |     2      |     3     |
| Beverage      | 7up          | lemonade   | mirinda    |
| Food          | pepper       | kiwi       | watermelon|
| Music-Genre   | d&b          | pop        | disco      |
| Nationality   | japanese     | nigerian   | chinese    |
| Sport         | badminton    |            |           |


From clue 2, basketball is to the left of mirinda. Since mirinda is in column 3 and badminton is already in column 1, basketball must be in column 2.


The final solution table is:

Lv7-5x3-9	"After analyzing the clues, I was able to fill in the table. Here is the solution:


|               |    1    |        2        |      3       |
| Hobby         | drawing |     sudoku      | woodworking  |
| Job           | doctor  | project-manager | photographer |
| Movie-Genre   | satire  | scientific      | superhero    |
| Nationality   | polish  | australian      | turkish      |
| Sport         | surfing | water-polo      | climbing     |

#############


Here's how the solution was derived:

From clue 5, we know the Turkish person is in an even position, which means they must be in position 2 or none at all. But since there are only three positions, it's more likely that the Turkish person is in position 2.

From clue 7 (which is a repeat of clue 1), we know the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the Polish person. This means the Polish person must be in position 1 or none at all. But since there are only three positions, it's more likely that the Polish person is in position 1.

From clue 2 and 6, we know the person who's sport is surfing is somewhere to the left of the person watching superhero movies, and also to the left of the person whose hobby is drawing. This means the person who's sport is surfing must be in position 1.

But wait, we already determined that the Polish person is in position 1! So, it seems that the Polish person's sport is surfing.

From clue 3, we know the project-manager is somewhere between the person who's sport is surfing and the Australian. Since the Polish person (whose sport is surfing) is in position 1, the project-manager must be in position 2, and the Australian must be in position 3.

From clue 4, we know the photographer is on the right of the person watching superhero movies. This means the person who's hobby is drawing must be watching satire movies (since they're not watching scientific or superhero), and the photographer must be watching scientific movies.

But wait, we already determined that the project-manager is in position 2! So, it seems that the project-manager is not watching scientific movies. The only other option left for the person watching scientific movies is the person whose hobby is sudoku.

From clue 8, we know the person who's sport is water-polo is between the person watching scientific movies and the person who's hobby is sudoku. This means the person who's sport is water-polo must be in position 2 (which is already occupied by the project-manager). So, it seems that the person whose hobby is sudoku is actually the one whose sport is water-polo.

The only remaining spot for the person whose hobby is woodworking is position 3. We also know from clue 1 that this person is on the right of the Polish person, which checks out since they're in position 3 and the Polish person is in position 1.

Finally, we can fill in the job and movie-genre columns based on the previous conclusions:

* The doctor must be watching satire movies (since they're not watching scientific or superhero), so they must be the one whose hobby is drawing.
* The photographer is watching superhero movies, which means they must be the person whose hobby is woodworking.

And that's it!"
