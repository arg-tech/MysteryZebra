Lv7-4x4-2	"After analyzing the clues, I've arrived at the solution:


|               |     1     |      2      |       3       |     4      |
| Food          | Apricot   | Onion       | Watermelon    | Mango      |
| Movie-Genre   | Time-travel| Thriller     | Crime         | Adventure  |
| Nationality   | Italian    | Australian   | Indonesian    | Chinese    |
| Sport         | Golf       | Volleyball   | Ice-hockey    | Weightlifting|

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 8, the person eating apricot is in an odd position. Since it can't be position 3 (due to clues 7 and 9), it must be either position 1 or 4.
* Clue 9 says the person eating apricot is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey, so apricot must be in position 1.
* From clue 11, the Chinese is the person who's sport is weightlifting. This means weightlifting is in position 4 (since Chinese can't be in position 2 or 3 due to other clues).
* Clue 7 says watermelon is between ice-hockey and Australian volleyball. Since apricot is already in position 1, this places watermelon in position 3.
* The Italian must be in position 1 or 2 (due to clue 2). If they were in position 2, the Indonesian would have to be in position 3 (clue 2), which conflicts with the placement of watermelon. Therefore, the Italian is in position 1.
* Clues 4 and 7 together imply that the Australian volleyball player is in position 2.
* The remaining movie genres can be placed using clues 3, 5, and 10.

Lv7-4x4-3	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a possible solution:


#############

|               |       1       |     2     |    3     |        4        |

| Pet           | Goat         | Lizard    | Dog         | Horse          |

#############

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning:

* Clue 1 and 10: The lizard is to the left of martial-arts, but also on the right of zombie movies. This suggests that zombie movies are in column 3.
* Clue 2: The lizard is between the bartender and martial-arts. Since zombie movies are in column 3, martial-arts must be in column 4.
* Clue 3: The designer is Polish, so they can't be German (clue 5). Therefore, the designer must be in column 2.
* Clue 4 and 6: The dog is on the left or right of the social-worker, but also to the right of action movies. This suggests that action movies are in column 1.
* Clue 5: The German is on the left or right of zombie movies (column 3). Since the designer is Polish, the German must be in column 4.
* Clue 7 and 8: The project-manager is not watching crime movies, so they must be watching martial-arts. Also, martial-arts are not watched by the social-worker.
* Clue 9: The bartender is on the left or right of crime movies (column 2).
* Clue 11: The designer is on the left or right of martial-arts. Since the designer is Polish and in column 2, they must be next to martial-arts in column 4.
* Clue 12: The Russian owns a horse.

Putting it all together leads to the solution above.

Lv7-4x4-4	"After analyzing the clues, I have come up with a solution to the puzzle:


#############

|               |      1      |       2        |        3        |      4       |
| Beverage      |  Almond-milk|    Mirinda     |   Soy-milk      |    Sprite    |
| Hobby         | Cooking     | Magic-tricks   | Rock-climbing   | Video-games  |
| Job           | Scientist  | Project-manager| Police-officer  | Mechanic     |
| Movie-Genre   | Drama       | Satire          | Crime            | Martial-arts |

#############


Let me explain my reasoning:

From clue 2, we know the scientist drinks almond-milk. From clue 6, we know the scientist (almond-milk) is to the left of the person drinking soy-milk.

From clue 1, we know the person watching crime movies is to the left of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since the police-officer watches crime movies (clue 9), and the police-officer is between the person who's hobby is magic-tricks and cooking (clue 8), we can deduce that the person watching crime movies must be in position 3.

From clue 4, we know the person drinking sprite watches martial-arts movies. Since the person drinking mirinda is to the left of the person drinking sprite (clue 3), we can place mirinda and sprite in positions 2 and 4, respectively.

The remaining beverage, soy-milk, must be in position 1 or 2. But since the person watching drama movies is to the right of the person drinking soy-milk (clue 10), we know soy-milk cannot be in position 1 (because there would be no one to watch drama movies). Therefore, soy-milk must be in position 3, which means almond-milk is in position 1.

The remaining hobby, video-games, must be in position 4, since it's the only one left. The person who's hobby is cooking cannot watch crime movies (clue 5), so cooking must be in position 1 or 2. But if cooking were in position 2, then magic-tricks would have to be in position 3, which contradicts clue 7. Therefore, cooking must be in position 1.

The remaining job, mechanic, is not the person watching crime movies (clue 11), so it must be in position 4.

Finally, we can fill in the movie-genre column using the clues: drama is watched by the person drinking almond-milk (in position 1), satire is watched by the person drinking mirinda (in position 2), crime is watched by the police-officer (in position 3), and martial-arts is watched by the person drinking sprite (in position 4).

This solution satisfies all the clues, and I hope it's correct!"
Lv7-4x4-5	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |      1      |     2     |    3     |    4     |
| Beverage      | milk        | almond-milk| tea       | soy-milk |
| Food          | broccoli    | cabbage   | banana    | spinach  |
| Nationality   | canadian    | brazilian | french    | turkish  |
| Transport     | ship        | trike     | roller    | jet-ski  |

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* From clue 7, we know the person driving the ship is on the far left. Clue 10 tells us that the person driving the ship is somewhere to the left of the person driving the jet-ski.
* From clue 11, we know the Turkish person drinks soy-milk and drives the jet-ski (clue 8). This means the Turkish person must be in column 4.
* Clue 9 tells us that the person driving the roller is between the person driving the jet-ski and the person driving the trike. Since the ship driver is on the far left, this means the roller driver must be in column 3.
* From clue 5, we know the trike driver is to the right of the ship driver. This means the trike driver must be in column 2.
* Clue 1 tells us that the French person is to the left of the person eating spinach. Since the Turkish person eats spinach (column 4), this means the French person must be in column 3.
* From clue 6, we know the milk drinker is next to the cabbage eater. We also know from clue 2 that the almond-milk drinker eats cabbage. Clue 4 tells us that the milk drinker and the cabbage eater are not the same person. This means the milk drinker must be in column 1.
* The only remaining beverage is tea, which must be in column 3 (clue 12).
* From clue 13, we know that the Brazilian person is next to the cabbage eater (column 2). Since the Canadian person is not mentioned in any other clues, they must be in column 1.

Therefore, the final solution table is:

Lv7-4x4-9	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a possible solution:


#############
|             |      1       |    2     |   3    |    4     |
| Beverage    | almond-milk  | sprite   | 7up    | water    |

| Job         | photographer | mechanic | nurse  | engineer |
| Transport   | scooter      | taxi     | roller | ship     |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* From clue 7, we know the engineer is on the right side, and from clue 10, the engineer is in an even position (i.e., position 2 or 4). Since the photographer is on the left of the person drinking water (clue 6), the photographer must be in position 1. This means the engineer can't be in position 2, so they must be in position 4.
* Clues 3 and 5 tell us that the person drinking 7up is on either side of the roller and to the right of the taxi. Since the roller can't be in position 1 (due to clue 15), it must be in position 3. The taxi, then, must be in position 2.
* Clue 8 tells us that the ship is to the right of the photographer, so it must be in position 4, which means the engineer drives a ship.
* From clue 9, we know the person drinking sprite is between the eggplant and tomato eaters. Since the roller is already assigned to position 3 (and can't be moved), this means the person eating eggplant must be in position 1. The onion eater is left of the scooter driver (clue 4), so they must be in position 2.
* Clues 11 and 13 tell us that the engineer is next to the nurse, who doesn't drive a scooter. This means the mechanic drives a taxi, not a scooter. Since the person drinking sprite is between the eggplant and tomato eaters (clue 9), this places the person eating onion in position 2.
* Finally, we can fill in the remaining beverage: almond-milk for the photographer.

Please note that this solution assumes the puzzle has a unique answer. If there are multiple possible solutions, I'd be happy to try and find them!"
