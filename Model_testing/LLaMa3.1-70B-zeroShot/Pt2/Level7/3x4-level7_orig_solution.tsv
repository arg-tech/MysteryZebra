6. Ice-hockey is on the left or right of the Brazilian (column 4).
7. The Brazilian is between the fan of disco and the Colombian (columns 2-3).
8. Badminton is between the fan of country and the fan of disco (columns 2-3).
9. Rugby is on the left or right of the fan of funk (columns 1-2).

|               |       1       |      2      |     3     |   4    |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate | 7up         | sprite     | water  |
| Food          | raspberry     | blueberry   | cauliflower| pepper|
| Nationality   | colombian     | nigerian    | mexican    | polish |

#############


Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:


1. From clue 5, we know the person eating blueberry is the Nigerian.
2. Clue 6 states that the person eating pepper is Polish, and clue 4 says they drink water. This gives us:
	* Position 4: Polish, Pepper, Water
3. Since the person eating blueberry (Nigerian) must be in an odd position (clue 2), and we already have position 4 filled, the Nigerian can only be in position 1 or 3.
4. Clue 10 says the Nigerian is on the left or right of the person eating pepper (Polish). Since position 4 is Polish, the Nigerian must be in position 3 (can't be in position 1 because it would violate clue 8).
5. Now that we have positions 3 and 4 filled:
	* Position 3: Nigerian, Blueberry
	* Position 4: Polish, Pepper, Water
6. Clue 7 states that the person drinking sprite is on the right of the Mexican. We know position 3 is the Nigerian, so the Mexican must be in position 2.
7. From clue 9, we know the person drinking 7up is between the person eating raspberry and the person drinking sprite. Since position 4 is water (not 7up) and position 3 has a blueberry-eater, the only possible arrangement for this is:
	* Position 1: Colombian, Raspberry
	* Position 2: Mexican, (unknown food)
8. The only remaining food is cauliflower, which must be in position 2.
9. Finally, since clue 3 states that the person drinking sprite is not eating cauliflower, and the only remaining beverage is hot-chocolate for position 1's Colombian (eating raspberry), we're done!

Lv7-3x4-3	"Let's break down the clues step by step:


From clue 3, we know the bus driver is in position 4.

From clue 1, we know the boat driver is to the left of the bus driver, so the boat driver must be in either position 1, 2, or 3.


From clue 5, we know the person who fishes does not drive a taxi. From clue 2, we know the fisherman is in an even position (2 or 4). But since the bus driver is already in position 4, the fisherman must be in position 2.


From clue 6, we know the fisherman is between the camper and the Dutch person. Since the fisherman is in position 2, the camper must be in position 1 (to the left of the fisherman).


From clue 8, we know the camper is to the left of the board-gamer. So, the board-gamer cannot be in position 1 (since that's the camper), and therefore must be in either position 3 or 4. But since position 4 is already taken by the bus driver, the board-gamer must be in position 3.


From clue 7, we know the bike driver is to the right of the taxi driver. From clue 9, we know the taxi driver is to the left of the bike driver (which confirms the same information). Since the fisherman (position 2) does not drive a taxi (clue 5), and the camper (position 1) does not drive a bike or taxi, it must be that the board-gamer (position 3) drives the bike.


Now we know the order of hobbies:


| Hobby         | camping   | fishing  | board-games |
|               |           |          |             |

The remaining hobby is writing, which must go in position 4. But wait! We already know that position 4 belongs to the bus driver. So, the bus driver's hobby is writing.


From clue 4, we know the American is between the Russian and the fisherman (who is in position 2). Since there are no other positions left for the American to be between those two people, it must be that the Russian is in position 1 (to the left of the American) and the fisherman is in position 2. But we already know the camper is in position 1! So, the camper must be Russian.


From clue 4 again, we know the American is between the Russian (camper) and the fisherman. So, the American must be in position 3, but that's taken by the board-gamer. Wait, no it's not! The American can't be in position 3 because then they wouldn't be ""between"" the Russian and the fisherman. Therefore, the American must be in position 2... no, wait, that's the fisherman!


Hmm, this is tricky. I re-read clue 4: ""The american is between the russian and the person who's hobby is fishing"". This doesn't say anything about which side of the Russian or the fisherman the American is on! So, it could be:


Russian | American | Fisherman


Or:


Fisherman | American | Russian


But we already know the camper (Russian) is in position 1. And since there's no one to the left of position 1, it must be that the American is between the fisherman and someone else (not the Russian). Who could this person be? Ah, I see! The Dutch person!


From clue 6 again: ""The person who's hobby is fishing is somewhere between the person who's hobby is camping and the dutch"". We already know the camper is in position 1. So:


Camper | Fisherman | American (between fisherman and...) | ???

Now it must be that the Dutch person is on the far right, driving the bus! But wait, we already know the bus driver's hobby is writing...


No problem!


| Hobby         | camping   | fishing  | board-games | writing    |
| Nationality   | russian   | american | dutch       | ???        |
| Transport     | boat      | taxi     | bike        | bus        |

The only nationality left is Nigerian. Since the Dutch person drives a bus, and the American isn't driving anything (they're between two people), it must be that the Nigerian drives either the taxi or the boat.


From clue 7 again: ""the person driving the bike is on the right of the person driving the taxi"". This tells us nothing new...


But from clue 1 again: ""The person driving the bus is somewhere to the right of the person driving the boat"". We know the bus driver (Dutch) is in position 4. So:


boat | ??? | ??? | bus


If we put the boat driver on the far left, it wouldn't be possible for the American to be between the Russian and the fisherman...


Therefore:


??? | boat | ??? | bus


We can put the taxi driver (Nigerian) in position 2, which means the bike driver must go in either position 3 or... actually, no other choice!


| Hobby         | camping   | fishing  | board-games | writing    |
| Nationality   | russian   | nigerian | american    | dutch      |
| Transport     | boat      | taxi     | bike        | bus        |

But what if we swapped the Nigerian and American nationalities?


That's perfectly valid!

Or... what if we swapped the Russian and American nationalities?


No, that wouldn't work.


But what about swapping the Nigerian and Dutch nationalities?


That's perfectly valid!

#############


Here's a brief explanation of the steps:

* From clue 7, we know the owner of the mouse drinks lemonade.
* Clue 6 tells us that lemonade is on the far left or right. Since the mouse owner can't be in an odd position (clue 3 mentions horse is in an odd position), lemonade must be on the far left (position 1).
* From clue 5, we know fanta is paired with rabbit.
* Clue 4 places cola between country and fanta. Since blues is in an even position (clue 8) and can't be next to country (due to its placement), cola must be in position 2.
* With cola in position 2, country must be either before or after it. But clue 2 says country is between cat and blues. So, country must be in position 3.
* The remaining positions are filled based on the other clues:
	+ Iced-tea (remaining beverage) goes to the last position (4).
	+ Blues (even position) goes to position 4.
	+ Horse (odd position) can't go with lemonade or cola, so it must be in position 4. But we already have blues there! So, horse must be in a different odd position - which is not possible. Hence, the only remaining option for horse is position 3 doesn't work due to country. Therefore, horse goes to an empty odd spot (none left!). Thus, Horse should go with Iced-Tea and D&B, at position 4.
	+ Cat (remaining pet) goes to the last available position - next to cola.

The final solution is:

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:

I started by using clues 4 and 7 to place the musician, doctor, and airplane. Then, I used clue 3 to place the dog owner between the goldfish and goat owners. Clue 6 helped me place the frog owner to the left of the goldfish owner.

Next, I used clue 8 to place the motorbike driver next to the train driver, and since the train is in an even position (clue 5), the motorbike must be in an odd position. This helped me finalize the transport column.

Finally, I used clues 1, 2, and 9 to make sure everything fit together correctly, and made any necessary adjustments.

Lv7-3x4-8	"Here is the solution:

| Pet           | rat          | lizard       | hedgehog | fish       |

Here's the explanation:


From clue 5, we know that the person who's hobby is board-games is on the far left. Clue 6 tells us that the person watching musical movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies, and since board-games is already on the far left, it must be musical movies that are associated with this person.


Clue 1 says the owner of the lizard is the person who's hobby is dancing. Clue 10 tells us that the person who's hobby is dancing is on the left of the person who's hobby is drawing. Since dancing can't be in column 4 (because then it would be to the right of everyone), and musical movies are already associated with board-games, we conclude that dancing must be in column 2.


From clue 3, we know that the owner of the rat is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since the only space available on the left is column 1 (because dancing is in column 2), it follows that the rat is associated with board-games.


Now we look at the remaining pets: fish, hedgehog, and lizard. We know from clue 1 that the owner of the lizard is the person who's hobby is dancing (in column 2). Clue 9 tells us that the person watching horror movies is somewhere to the right of the owner of the lizard, which puts horror movies in either column 3 or 4.


Clue 8 says the person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the owner of the hedgehog. Since dancing (in column 2) is already to the left of someone (drawing), and we can't have two people with hobbies on the same side, it follows that the hedgehog must be in either column 3 or 4.


But clue 2 says the owner of the fish is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since drawing can't be in column 4 (because then dancing would be to the right of everyone), and we already know that dancing is associated with lizard, it must be hedgehog that is in either column 3 or 4. Which means that the fish is not in column 2.


Therefore, by elimination, the hedgehog is in column 4 and the fish is in column 4.


Now we can determine the order of the movie genres using clues 4, 6, and 7:


martial-arts movies are on the left of horror movies (clue 4), musical movies are to the left of martial-arts movies (clue 6), and spy movies must be on the right of everyone else because horror movies are somewhere between martial-arts movies and spy movies (clue 7).


Finally, we fill in the remaining hobby (drawing) in column 3.


And that's it!

From clue 1, we know that Animation is to the left of Superhero.


From clue 4 and 5, we can deduce that the order for movie-genres is: Animation, Superhero, ?, ?


From clue 2, Crime must be to the right of Broccoli.


From clue 8, Dog's owner is to the left of Crime. Since Chinchilla's owner is also on the left (clue 3), we can place them in order as Chinchilla, Goat (clue 7), and then Dog (clue 8).


Since Superhero must be between Animation and Asparagus (clue 4), we can conclude that Animation eats Broccoli.


From clue 5, Blueberry is to the left of Superhero. Therefore, Blueberry's owner watches Superhero movies.


By elimination, Asparagus' owner must watch Horror movies.


From clue 9, Goat's owner is on the left of Papaya's owner. Since Dog's owner is also on the right (clue 8), we can place them in order as Chinchilla, Goat, and then Dog.

| Sport         | Weightlifting| Baseball  | Surfing    | Water-polo |
| Transport     | Snowmobile  | Boat      | Scooter    | Jet-ski    |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 9, we know that the person who's sport is weightlifting is on the far left. This gives us a starting point.

From clue 2, we know that the person who's sport is surfing is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. So, the surfer cannot be in column 1.

From clue 6, we know that the Brazilian is on the left of the person driving the scooter. Since the Italian (from clue 3) and the Brazilian are not the same person (from clue 8), the Brazilian must be in column 2.

From clue 7, we know that the Brazilian is between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the person driving the snowmobile. This means the Brazilian cannot drive the scooter or jet-ski, so they must be associated with baseball (the only remaining sport).

Now we have:


|               |       1       |     2     |     3      |     4      |

| Transport     | Snowmobile  | Boat      | Scooter    | Jet-ski    |

From clue 1, we know that the person who's sport is surfing is not driving the scooter. So, they must be associated with either boat or jet-ski.

From clue 4, we know that the Egyptian cannot drive a boat (since it's not the same as their transport). The Egyptian also can't be in column 3 or 4, since the Italian and Malaysian are there respectively. Therefore, the boat belongs to the Brazilian.

The scooter belongs to either the Italian or the Malaysian. From clue 5, we know that the Malaysian is to the right of the person who's sport is baseball (i.e., the Brazilian). So, the Malaysian cannot be in column 3. The Italian must drive the scooter.


|               |       1       |     2     |     3      |     4      |

| Transport     | Snowmobile  | Boat      | Scooter    | Jet-ski    |

Finally, from clue 5, we know that the Malaysian is to the right of the person who's sport is baseball. This means they must be associated with water-polo (the only remaining sport).
