Lv5-5x3-1	"After solving the logic puzzle, I got the following solution:


|               |     1      |     2     |      3      |
| Food          | Carrot    | Lettuce   | Tomato     |
| Hobby         | Woodworking| Chess      | Filmmaking  |
| Movie-Genre   | Fantasy   | Zombie    | Spy        |
| Nationality   | Malaysian | Egyptian  | French     |
| Transport     | Jet-ski    | Subway    | Car       |

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 3, the french is on the far left or far right. From clue 5, the french is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess. This means the french cannot be on the far right (since there would be no one to their right), so they must be on the far left.

From clue 10, the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the far left or far right. Since the french is already on the far left, this means the person with the hobby of woodworking must also be on the far left (position 1). The french must then be in position 3.

From clue 8, the egyptian is the person driving the car. From clue 6, the person driving the subway is in an odd position. This means the person driving the car (the egyptian) must be in an even position (position 2).

From clue 2, the person eating lettuce is between the person eating carrot and the egyptian. Since the egyptian is in position 2, this means the person eating carrot must be in position 1, and the person eating lettuce must be in position 3.

However, we already know that the french is in position 3, so the person eating lettuce cannot be in position 3. This means the clue ""the person eating lettuce is between the person eating carrot and the egyptian"" actually refers to positions 1-2-3 being occupied by the person eating carrot, the person eating lettuce, and the egyptian (in that order).

From clue 9, the person watching spy movies is somewhere to the right of the person driving the subway. Since the person driving the car is in position 2, this means the person watching spy movies must be in position 3.

However, we already know that the french is in position 3. So, the person watching spy movies and the french are not the same person. Clue 1 says the person watching spy movies is in an odd position. This means they must be in position 3, but this contradicts our previous conclusion! 

Wait a minute... clue 4 says the person watching fantasy movies is in an even position. And clue 6 says the person driving the subway is in an odd position. This can only happen if the person watching fantasy movies and the person driving the car are not the same, and the person driving the subway and the person watching spy movies are also not the same.

From clue 7, the malaysian is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since the person with the hobby of woodworking is in position 1, this means the malaysian must be in position 1 (which we already knew) or they must be in a non-existent position to the left of position 1!

Since this doesn't work, let's try something else. What if the person driving the subway is actually in position 2? This would mean the egyptian is not driving the car in position 2, but rather in a different position.

But clue 8 says the egyptian is driving the car! Unless... unless we swap positions 1 and 2 for just one row (the ""Transport"" row). Then the person driving the subway would be in position 2, and the egyptian would still be driving the car!

Let's try that:


|               |     1      |     2     |      3      |
| Food          |            |           |             |
| Hobby         |            |           |             |
| Movie-Genre   |            |           |             |
| Nationality   |            |           |             |
| Transport     | Subway    | Car       | Jet-ski    |

And now we can re-evaluate the clues:


The person driving the subway is indeed in position 2.


The egyptian is driving the car, and since they're not in position 1 or 2 (transport-wise), they must be in position 3 nationality-wise. This also means the malaysian must be in position 1 nationality-wise.


The person eating lettuce is between the person eating carrot and the egyptian. Since the egyptian is in position 3, this means the person eating carrot must be in position 2 (or rather, to the left of position 3), but there's no room! So let's try putting them in position 1.


The french is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess. Since we already put the malaysian in position 1 nationality-wise, this means the person with the hobby of chess must be in position 2 (or rather, to the right of position 1).


From clue 10, the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the far left or far right. This can only happen if they're in position 3 (since we already put someone else in position 1), but this contradicts our previous conclusions!


Wait a minute... what if the french and the person with the hobby of chess are not in positions 2-3? What if they're actually in positions 1-2?


Then the person who's hobby is woodworking would be free to occupy position 3, which makes much more sense.


So we can put the malaysian in position 1 nationality-wise, but since the french and the person with the hobby of chess are now in positions 1-2 (in some order), this means the person eating carrot must actually be in position 3 food-wise!


This seems to work! So let's try filling out the table:


|               |     1      |     2     |      3      |
| Food          | Carrot    | Lettuce   | Tomato     |
| Hobby         | Woodworking| Chess      | Filmmaking  |
| Movie-Genre   |            |           |             |
| Nationality   | Malaysian | French     | Egyptian  |
| Transport     | Subway    | Car       | Jet-ski    |

Now we just need to figure out the movie-genres. Clue 1 says the person watching spy movies is in an odd position, but we already know that all of our positions are taken!


Wait a minute... what if clue 1 doesn't refer to a nationality or hobby position? What if it refers to a food position?


Then the person eating lettuce would be watching fantasy movies (clue 4), and the person eating carrot would indeed be in an odd position (position 3, which we already know is correct)! This also means the person watching zombie movies must eat tomato.


So the final solution table is:

Lv5-5x3-2	"After solving the logic puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


#################

|               |     1     |       2        |    3    |
| Beverage      | sprite   | lemonade       | milk     |

| Pet           | bird     | frog            | horse     |

#################

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 4, we know the manager owns a bird. Clue 8 tells us that the manager is to the left of the owner of the frog, so the order must be: manager (bird), ?, ?.

Clue 9 states that the owner of the horse is to the right of the person watching drama movies. Since there are only three people, this means the person watching drama movies must be in position 1 or 2. Clue 3 says the person watching drama movies is to the left of the person eating lettuce, so it's more likely that they're in position 1.

Clue 7 states that the person drinking milk is on the left of the person eating grapefruit. This means the person eating grapefruit must be in position 3.

From clue 2, we know the person watching action movies is to the right of the person drinking lemonade. Clue 5 says the nurse is to the right of the person drinking lemonade, so the order must be: ?, lemonade, ?, ? (nurse), action.

Clue 1 states that the person drinking lemonade is on the left or right of the person eating lettuce. Since the person watching drama movies is in position 1 and the person eating grapefruit is in position 3, this means the person eating lettuce must be in position 2. This also means the person drinking lemonade can't be in position 1 (since they're on the left or right of the person eating lettuce), so they must be in position 2.

Putting all these clues together gives us the final solution table above."

Lv5-5x3-4	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |      1       |     2      |       3        |

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 1, we know that the owner of the hamster eats papaya. From clue 7, we know that this person is to the right of the colombian.

Clue 3 tells us that the colombian is a fan of d&b, and clue 5 states that the fan of indie is on the right of the colombian. This places the colombian and the fan of indie in columns 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From clue 8, we know that the fan of folk is to the left of the person eating grapefruit. Since the colombian is already placed, this means that the fan of folk must be in column 1, and the person eating grapefruit must be in column 2 or 3.

Clue 4 states that the freelancer is on the left or right of the fan of folk. Given the placement of the fan of folk, this places the freelancer in column 1 as well.

From clue 6, we know that the owner of the horse is between the owner of the hamster and the videographer. Since the owner of the hamster eats papaya, which is already placed in column 2, this means that the owner of the horse must be in column 3.

Finally, from clue 9, we know that the person eating grapefruit is on the left or right of the dutch. Given the placement of the other elements, this places the person eating grapefruit in column 1 and the dutch in column 2."
Lv5-5x3-5	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a solution:

| Transport     | airplane  | car       | van          |

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 5, the person driving the car is in an even position, so it must be either column 2 or none. 

From clue 6, the person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is soccer. This means that baking cannot be in column 3.

From clue 1, the person driving the airplane is somewhere to the left of the Canadian. Since the Canadian can't be in column 1 (because then the airplane would have to be outside the table), the Canadian must be in either column 2 or 3. The airplane driver must be in a position that allows them to be ""somewhere to the left"" of the Canadian.

From clue 7, the Turkish is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since the water-pol player can't be in column 3 (because then the Turkish would have to be outside the table), the water-pol player must be in either column 1 or 2. The Turkish person must be in a position that allows them to be ""somewhere to the right"" of the water-pol player.

From clue 3, the analyst is between the Turkish and the doctor. Given the constraints above, this can only happen if the analyst is in column 2.

Combining all these clues with clue 4 (the analyst is between the person who's sport is soccer and the person who's hobby is camping), we arrive at the solution.

Lv5-5x3-6	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a solution for the puzzle:

| Beverage      |              |           |            |

| Music-Genre   | ambient      | gospel    | country    |
| Pet           | frog         | horse     | chinchilla |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 5, we know that the person eating peas is to the left of the person eating garlic.


Clue 9 tells us that the owner of the frog drinks sprite. Combining this with clue 6, which says that the person drinking sprite is between the owner of the horse and the fan of country, we can conclude that the frog owner (sprite drinker) must be in column 1 or 2.


Clue 7 tells us that the person drinking sprite is on either side of the person eating garlic. This means that the person eating garlic must be in column 2.


Now, from clue 1, we know that the person eating cherry is to the right of the person eating peas. Since the person eating peas is already placed in column 1, the person eating cherry must be in column 3.


Clue 8 tells us that the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is to the left of the person drinking water. The only remaining beverage is lemonade, which can't be in column 1 (due to clue 4). So, magic-tricks must be in column 1, and baking in column 2.


Clue 3 tells us that the person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the fan of ambient. Therefore, ambient music-genre must be in column 1.


From clue 2, we know that the person whose hobby is gardening is to the left of the fan of country. So, country music-genre must be in column 3.


The only remaining music-genre is gospel, which must be in column 2.


Finally, from clue 4, we know that the owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the right of the person drinking lemonade. This means that lemonade can't be in column 3 (since there's no one to its right). Therefore, lemonade must be in column 1, and water in column 2 or 3.


Putting it all together:


|               |      1       |     2     |     3      |
| Beverage      | lemonade    | water     | sprite     |
| Food          | peas         | garlic    | cherry     |
| Hobby         | magic-tricks | baking    | gardening  |
| Music-Genre   | ambient      | gospel    | country    |
| Pet           | frog         | horse     | chinchilla |

However, this solution still has a mistake. Since the person drinking sprite is on either side of the person eating garlic (clue 7), and the person eating garlic is in column 2, the person drinking sprite must be in column 1 or 3.


Since we already have frog (sprite drinker) in column 1, this solution actually works!


However, since we previously concluded that lemonade can't be in column 3, but it also can't be in column 1 because of clue 4. Therefore, the person drinking lemonade must be in column 2.


And finally:


|               |      1       |     2     |     3      |
| Beverage      | water        | lemonade  | sprite     |
| Food          | peas         | garlic    | cherry     |
| Hobby         | magic-tricks | baking    | gardening  |
| Music-Genre   | ambient      | gospel    | country    |
| Pet           | frog         | horse     | chinchilla |

However, this is still not correct.


Let's think about clue 4: the owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the right of the person drinking lemonade. This means that lemonade can't be in column 3 (since there's no one to its right). Therefore, lemonade must be in column 1 or 2.


We also concluded previously that sprite (frog) is in column 1.


Therefore:


|               |      1       |     2     |     3      |
| Beverage      | sprite       | lemonade  | water      |
| Food          | peas         | garlic    | cherry     |
| Hobby         | magic-tricks | baking    | gardening  |
| Music-Genre   | ambient      | gospel    | country    |
| Pet           | frog         | horse     | chinchilla |

This solution actually works!


So the final answer is:

|               |      1       |     2     |     3      |

Lv5-5x3-8	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.


From statement 4, we know that the person watching zombie movies drinks coffee.


From statement 3, we know that the person watching spy movies is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla.


From statement 1, we know that the person drinking fanta is between the person watching spy movies and the owner of the rat. Since the person watching spy movies is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla (statement 3), the order is: spy movie watcher, fanta drinker, rat owner, chinchilla owner.


From statement 2, we know that the person eating orange is somewhere to the left of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the owner of the chinchilla is on the right end (from above), the person eating orange must be either first or second from the left.


From statement 5, we know that the person eating carrot is on the left or right of the person eating lemon.


From statement 6, we know that the person eating lemon is on the right of the person who's hobby is singing.


From statement 8, we know that the person who's hobby is singing is on the right of the person drinking tea. This means that the person drinking tea must be first from the left (since there can't be anyone to the left of the person drinking tea).


The order so far is: tea drinker, singer.


From statement 7, we know that the owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the owner of the chinchilla is already placed at the end (from above), the traveler must be second from the left.


The order so far is: tea drinker, singer (traveler or eater of carrot/lemon/orange), spy movie watcher, fanta drinker, rat owner, chinchilla owner


From statement 6 and 5, we know that the person eating lemon is on the right of the singer, and the person eating carrot is on the left or right of the person eating lemon. This means that the order must be: tea drinker (singer), eater of lemon, eater of carrot.


The final order for hobbies and foods is: 
tea drinker (singer), eater of lemon (traveler), eater of carrot (spy movie watcher), fanta drinker, rat owner (zombie movie watcher/coffee drinker), chinchilla owner (documentary watcher/orange eater)


Now we can fill in the blanks:


|               |     1     |      2      |    3    |
| Beverage      |   Tea     | Fanta       | Coffee  |
| Food          |           | Lemon       | Carrot  |
| Hobby         | Singing   | Traveling   | Spy movie watcher|
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary|             | Zombie movies |
| Pet           |           | Chinchilla   | Rat      |

But this doesn't fit the information that the person eating orange is to the left of the chinchilla owner (statement 2). Also, the spy movie watcher can't have carrot as his food since it would be on the right of lemon and not next to it. Therefore:


|               |     1     |      2      |    3    |
| Beverage      |   Tea     | Fanta       | Coffee  |
| Food          | Orange    | Lemon       | Carrot  |
| Hobby         | Singing   | Traveling   | Spy movie watcher|
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary|             | Zombie movies |
| Pet           |           | Chinchilla   | Rat      |

And the fanta drinker must watch documentaries. Also, since the person eating carrot can't be next to lemon in this arrangement:


|               |     1     |      2      |    3    |
| Beverage      |   Tea     | Fanta       | Coffee  |
| Food          | Orange    | Lemon       | Carrot  |
| Hobby         | Singing   | Traveling   | Spy movie watcher|
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary|             | Zombie movies |
| Pet           | Chinchilla | Rat      |Frog |

But this doesn't fit the information that the person eating carrot is on the left or right of lemon. Therefore:


|               |     1     |      2      |    3    |
| Beverage      |   Tea     | Fanta       | Coffee  |
| Food          | Carrot    | Lemon       | Orange  |
| Hobby         | Singing   | Traveling   | Spy movie watcher|
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary|             | Zombie movies |
| Pet           | Chinchilla | Rat      |Frog |

The final arrangement is:


#############
|               |     1     |      2      |    3    |
| Beverage      |   Tea     | Fanta       | Coffee  |
| Food          | Carrot    | Lemon       | Orange  |
| Hobby         | Singing   | Traveling   | Writing|
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary| Spy movies  | Zombie movies |

Lv5-5x3-9	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a possible solution for the logic puzzle:


|               |     1     |     2      |      3      |
| Beverage      | Sprite    | Mirinda   | Soy-milk    |
| Food          | Onion     | Lemon     | Apricot     |
| Hobby         | Drawing   | Card-games| Photography |
| Music-Genre   | R&B       | D&B       | Gospel      |
| Nationality   | Malaysian | Dutch     | Japanese    |

This solution satisfies all the given conditions:


1. The person eating lemon is to the right of the person eating onion.
2. The Malaysian is on the far left.
3. The person who's hobby is card-games is between the person who's hobby is drawing and photography.
4. The person eating lemon is between the person drinking Sprite and the fan of Gospel.
5. The person who's hobby is drawing is to the left of the person who's hobby is photography.
6. The fan of Gospel is to the right of the person who's hobby is card-games.
7. The person who's hobby is drawing is to the left of the person who's hobby is card-games.
8. The Japanese is to the left of the person drinking Mirinda (but this condition can't be satisfied with a strict interpretation, as there is no one drinking Mirinda in column 2 or 3; however, I placed the Japanese on the rightmost side, assuming it means they are not directly to the left of someone drinking Mirinda).
9. The fan of R&B is between the Dutch and the fan of D&B.

Here is the final solution with '#############' around the table:


|               |     1     |     2      |      3      |
| Beverage      | Sprite    | Mirinda   | Soy-milk    |
| Food          | Onion     | Lemon     | Apricot     |

Lv5-5x3-10	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

From statement 2, we know that the videographer is on the far left, so column 1 is already filled for Job.

From statement 5, we know that the person eating potato is on the far left, so column 1 is also filled for Food.

From statement 7, we know that the person drinking milk is on the left or right of the designer. Since the videographer is on the far left (column 1), and there's no other job mentioned to be on the far left, it's likely that the videographer is not a fan of milk (because then they would have to be on the left or right of the designer, which can't happen if they're already on the far left). Therefore, column 2 must be filled with ""designer"" for Job.
