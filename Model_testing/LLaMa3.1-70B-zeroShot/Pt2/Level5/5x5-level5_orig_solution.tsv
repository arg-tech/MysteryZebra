| Transport     | Van      | Tram     | Trike      | Quad-Bike    | Ship       |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* Clue 2 and 14 helped to place Indie in the middle (3rd position) and Board-Games also in the middle.
* Clue 15 placed Skateboarding to the left of Carrot, and since Skateboarding is on the right side of Parkour (Clue 11), we can deduce that Skateboarding is in the 5th position and Carrot is in the 5th column as well.
* Clue 1 placed Hip-Hop to the right of Board-Games, so Hip-Hop must be in the 4th or 5th position. Since Singing is the hobby of the person who likes Hip-Hop (Clue 10), and Board-Games is to the left of Singing (Clue 24), we can conclude that Singing and Hip-Hop are in the 4th position.
* Clue 7 placed Hip-Hop on the left or right of Pepper, which helped to confirm that Hip-Hop is indeed in the 4th position, with Pepper as its corresponding food.
* Clues 6 and 22 helped to place Pear to the left of Cucumber, and also to the left of Tram. This allowed us to deduce that Pear is in the 2nd column, with Board-Games as its corresponding hobby.
* Clue 3 placed Blues to the left of Biathlon, which means Blues must be on the far left (Clue 13). We can then conclude that Blueberry corresponds to Blues.
* Clue 5 linked Fishing and Lacrosse, and since Skateboarding is already in the 5th position, we know that Lacrosse must be in a different column. Clue 21 helped us place Baking and Badminton together, but not adjacent to each other.
* Clues 9 and 20 helped us place House and Trike, with Indie as the corresponding music genre.

Lv5-5x5-7	"I'll solve the puzzle and provide the final solution.


After analyzing all 18 clues, I've constructed the following table:


#############
|               |       1       |   2    |     3     |     4      |      5      |

| Sport         | soccer       | parkour | tennis    | biathlon   | water-polo  |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of the solution:


From clue 3, we know the person watching spy movies is also the one whose sport is biathlon. Clue 7 places this person to the left of the person whose sport is water-polo.


Clue 2 tells us the chef drinks hot-chocolate, and from clue 6, we know the chef is in an odd position. The only possibility for the chef is column 1.


Using clues 4 and 10, we can place the mechanic to the right of the person drinking tea, which means the mechanic must be in column 5.


From clue 9, we know the person watching adventure movies is on either side of the freelancer. Since the freelancer is also mentioned in clue 17, we can conclude that the freelancer drinks soy-milk and is in column 2.


Clue 8 places the person eating garlic between the chef (column 1) and the person whose sport is soccer (column 4). This implies the person eating garlic is in column 3.


From clues 13 and 17, we know the person drinking soy-milk is on either side of the person eating cherry. Since the freelancer drinks soy-milk, this means the person eating cherry must be in column 2 or 3. However, clue 18 places the person eating peach to the left of the person drinking tea, which forces the person eating cherry into column 2.


We can now use clues 11 and 16 to place the person watching thriller movies in an odd position (column 1) and the person whose sport is tennis in an even position (column 4).


Clue 15 tells us the person watching animation movies has a sport of parkour, which must be column 3.


The remaining clues can be used to fill in the gaps:


* Clue 5 places the doctor to the left of the person whose sport is soccer.
* Clue 12 places the freelancer to the right of the person whose sport is soccer.
* Clue 14 forces the person whose sport is tennis into column 4.


The final solution table is above."
Lv5-5x5-8	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |       4       |     5      |

| Sport         | badminton | handball  | tennis    | rugby     | skateboarding|

Let me explain the reasoning behind this solution:


From clue 2, we know that blueberry is to the left of watermelon.


From clue 4 and 9, we can deduce that the person who's sport is handball ( filmmaking) is on the left or right of the person eating peach.


From clue 5, we know that the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the thai.


From clue 10 and 11, we can deduce that tennis is to the right of artichoke and badminton.


From clue 12, we know that the british is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.


From clue 13, we know that the british is in an odd position.


From clue 14, we can deduce that dancing (skateboarding) is to the left of rugby.


From clue 15, we know that the nigerian is somewhere to the left of the british.


From clue 16, we know that watermelon is watching comedy movies.


From clue 17, we can deduce that dancing is on the left or right of watermelon.


From clue 18 and 19, we can deduce that skydiving (disaster) is to the left of mystery.


From clue 20, we can deduce that skydiving is on the left or right of artichoke.


From clue 21, we know that gardening is somewhere to the left of singing.


From clue 22, we know that tennis is between thai and mystery.


Using all these clues, we can construct the final solution table:

Lv5-5x5-9	"After solving the logic puzzle, I came up with the following solution:

| Transport     | scooter       | airplane  | roller   | van      | boat          |

The steps to solve the puzzle were:

* From clue 10, we know that the person eating peach is in an odd position. Since there are only two odd positions (1 and 3) for a specific food type, this means the person eating peach must be at either position 1 or 3.
* Clue 8 tells us that the person watching drama movies is the person eating peach. So, we can conclude that drama movies are associated with either position 1 or 3.
* From clue 11, we know that the electrician (Chinese) is on the right of the person watching spy movies. This means that the Chinese cannot be at position 5 (there would be no one to their left).
* Clue 14 tells us that the Indian is somewhere to the left of the teacher, which means they must be in either positions 1 or 2.
* From clue 13, we know that the Indian is in an odd position. So, this means the Indian is at either position 1 or 3 (but not position 2).
* Clue 4 tells us that the manager is somewhere to the left of the Chinese. This means that the manager cannot be at position 5.
* By using a combination of clues 6 and 14, we can deduce that the Indian must be at position 1 and the teacher (driving scooter) at position 3.
* Now, from clue 10, we know that peach is in an odd position. Since the Indian and Teacher are already placed at positions 1 and 3, peach cannot be at position 3. So, it must be at position 5 or 1 (but not position 3).
* Clue 8 says drama movies are associated with peach, but clue 1 says that sports movies are to the right of drama movies. This means that peach (drama movies) must be at either positions 1 or 3.
* Clue 18 tells us that corn is on the left of disaster movies and clue 20 says corn is somewhere to the right of Indian. Therefore, we can place corn between the Indian (position 1) and drama movies (peach).
* Now, using a combination of clues 7, 15, and 17, we can conclude that pineapple must be at position 5.
* By using a process of elimination for jobs, nationalities, transports, and movie-genres, we can fill in the remaining slots.

This solution satisfies all given conditions."
Lv5-5x5-10	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:

| Transport   | Helicopter   | Tram        | Quad-bike| Scooter       | Ship       |

 Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 9, the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the far left or far right. Since they are also the person who's sport is weightlifting (clue 7), and there is only one person whose sport is weightlifting, they must be on the far left.

From clue 1, the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the person driving the ship. This means that the person driving the ship cannot be in position 1 or 2. Clue 11 states that the person driving the quad-bike is somewhere to the right of the person driving the ship, so the person driving the ship must be in position 4 or 5.

Clue 18 states that the person who's sport is baseball is in the middle, which means they are in position 3. Clues 10 and 22 state that the person drinking soy-milk is the person who's sport is baseball, and they drive a scooter, respectively.

Using clue 16, we know that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is also the person who's sport is cricket. They must be in position 5, as the person driving the ship cannot be in this position (clue 1).

Clue 3 states that the person who's hobby is hiking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. This means that they are either in position 4 or not at all, but clue 19 rules out the possibility of them being in any other position.

From here, it's just a matter of using the remaining clues to fill in the gaps.
