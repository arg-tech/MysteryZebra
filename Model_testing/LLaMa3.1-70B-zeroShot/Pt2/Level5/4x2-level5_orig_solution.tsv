Lv5-4x2-1	"After analyzing the clues, I've filled in the table as follows:


|               |     1      |     2     |
| Food          | pumpkin    | blueberry|
| Hobby         | filmmaking | skydiving |
| Movie-Genre   | musical    | satire   |
| Nationality   | argentine  | pakistani|


Here's how I deduced the solution:

* From clue 3, we know that the person who likes skydiving is on the right of the person who likes filmmaking. So, filmmaking must be in column 1 and skydiving in column 2.
* From clue 2, we know that the Pakistani watches satire movies. Since the Pakistani is on the right (from clue 1), satire must be in column 2.
* Now, we can conclude that musical must be in column 1 (since there are only two movie genres).
* Clue 1 states that the Pakistani is to the right of the person eating pumpkin. Therefore, the person eating pumpkin must be in column 1, and blueberry must be in column 2.
* Finally, since there's only one nationality left, the Argentine must be in column 1.

Lv5-4x2-2	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |      1      |     2      |
| Food          | pomegranate | zucchini   |
| Movie-Genre   | epic        | comedy     |
| Pet           | rabbit      | cat        |
| Transport     | bus         | snowmobile|

Here's my reasoning:

From clue 2, we know that the person watching epic movies is to the left of the owner of the rabbit. This means that epic movies must be in column 1, and the rabbit must be in column 2.

Clue 1 states that the person driving the snowmobile is to the right of the person eating pomegranate. Since we already have epic movies in column 1, we can place pomegranate in column 1 as well. This means that the person eating zucchini must be driving the snowmobile.

Now, let's put it all together:


#############
|               |      1      |     2      |
| Food          | pomegranate | zucchini   |

Lv5-4x2-3	"Here is the solved puzzle:


#############

|               |      1       |    2     |
| Hobby         | puzzles     | chess    |
| Job           | entrepreneur| mechanic |
| Music-Genre   | house       | trance   |
| Transport     | motorbike   | ship     |

#############


Explanation:

From clue 3, we know the mechanic drives a ship. From clue 1, we know the person who likes puzzles is to the left of the person who likes chess. So, the puzzle lover must be in column 1.

Now, from clue 2, we know the entrepreneur is to the left of the fan of house music. Since there are only two columns, this means the entrepreneur must be in column 1 and the fan of house music must be in column 2.

Putting it all together:


The person who likes puzzles (column 1) must be an entrepreneur (from clue 2), so their job is entrepreneur.

The person who likes chess (column 2) drives a ship, which means they are the mechanic (from clue 3).

Since the fan of house music is in column 2 (from clue 2), and the person in column 1 is an entrepreneur, the person in column 1 must like trance music.

Finally, since the person who likes puzzles drives neither the motorbike nor the ship (the ship driver is the mechanic), they must drive a motorbike."
Lv5-4x2-4	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a possible solution:


|               |    1    |     2      |
| Beverage      | Coffee   | 7up        |
| Hobby         | Drawing  | Collecting |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic     | Western    |
| Transport     | Jet-ski  | Bus        |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 1, we know that the person drinking 7up is to the right of the person driving the jet-ski. This means that the jet-ski must be on the left (person 1), and the 7up drinker must be on the right (person 2).

From clue 2, we know that the person whose hobby is collecting is on the far right. This matches with our previous conclusion that person 2 drinks 7up.

Clue 3 tells us that the person drinking 7up is to the left or right of the person watching epic movies. Since we already determined that person 2 drinks 7up, and person 1 drives a jet-ski (not an epic movie watcher), person 1 must watch epic movies.

The remaining options can be filled in using process of elimination:

* Person 1 watches epic movies, so person 2 must watch western movies.
* The only hobby left is drawing, which must belong to person 1.
* The only beverage left is coffee, which must belong to person 1.

Lv5-4x2-5	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############

|               |     1     |      2      |
| Food          | asparagus | tomato    |
| Job           | scientist | firefighter|
| Nationality   | colombian | canadian   |
| Sport         | cycling    | surfing   |

#############


Here's my thought process:

From clue 3, we know the scientist is to the left of the Colombian. This means the scientist must be in position 1.

Clue 2 tells us that the person who likes surfing is in an odd position (i.e., position 1 or 3). Since there are only two positions, it's safe to assume that surfing is associated with position 2.

Now, looking at clue 1, we know the firefighter is to the right of the person eating asparagus. This means asparagus must be in position 1, and the firefighter must be in position 2.

The only remaining food item is tomato, which must be associated with position 2 (firefighter).

Lastly, since the scientist is already assigned to position 1, we can conclude that the Colombian nationality belongs to position 1 as well. This leaves the Canadian nationality for position 2.

Putting it all together, we arrive at the solution table above!"
Lv5-4x2-6	"Based on the given clues, we can solve the puzzle as follows:


From clue 1, we know that the fan of hip-hop is on the far left.


|               |      1      |        2        |
| Beverage      |             |                 |

| Job           |             |                 |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop     |                 |

From clue 3, we know that the person eating cucumber is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda.


Since the fan of hip-hop is on the far left, and the person eating cucumber is to the left of the person drinking mirinda, it means the person eating cucumber must be in column 1. 


|               |      1      |        2        |
| Beverage      |             |                 |
| Food          | cucumber    |                 |
| Job           |             |                 |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop     |                 |

From clue 2, we know that the firefighter is the person drinking sprite.


We can now fill in column 1 with the remaining information. The firefighter must be the person eating cucumber and listening to hip-hop, and drinking a beverage other than mirinda (since the person eating cucumber is to the left of the person drinking mirinda). Therefore, the firefighter drinks sprite.


|               |      1      |        2        |
| Beverage      | sprite     |                 |
| Food          | cucumber    |                 |
| Job           | firefighter |                 |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop     |                 |

The remaining columns can be filled in with the remaining information. The person drinking mirinda must be in column 2, and they cannot listen to hip-hop (since the fan of hip-hop is on the far left). They also cannot eat cucumber (since that food is already assigned to column 1). Therefore, they must listen to metal and eat tomato.


The remaining job, project-manager, can only go with the person drinking mirinda and listening to metal.


Here is the final solution table:

| Job        | Coach   | Paramedic  |
| Pet        | Horse   | Fish       |
#############


Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 3, we know that the person who drinks coffee has a hobby of camping. So, in column 1, Beverage is Coffee and Hobby is Camping.

From clue 2, we know that the owner of the fish is to the right of the coach. This means that the Coach must be in column 1, as there's no one to the left of column 1.

Now, looking at column 2, since the Coach is already placed in column 1, the Job in column 2 must be Paramedic.

From clue 1, we know that the person drinking coffee (column 1) is to the left of the owner of the fish. This means that the owner of the fish must be in column 2, and therefore, Pet in column 1 is not Fish but Horse.

Finally, Beverage in column 2 must be Sprite, as Coffee is already taken by column 1.

Hobby in column 2 is Photography, as Camping is already taken by column 1."
