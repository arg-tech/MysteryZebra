Lv5-2x4-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:


From clue 3, we know the Brazilian is in an odd position, so it can be either position 1 or 3.


From clue 5, we know the Brazilian drinks lemonade. Since the Brazilian is in an odd position, let's place them in position 1 for now:

|               |   1    |       2       |     3     |   4    |
| Beverage      | lemonade |               |           |        |
| Nationality   | brazilian|               |           |        |

From clue 1, we know the person drinking hot-chocolate is to the left of the person drinking lemonade. But since the Brazilian (who drinks lemonade) is already in position 1, there's no one to the left. So, this clue tells us that the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in a later position.


From clue 4, we know the person drinking water is to the left of the Nigerian.


From clue 2, we know the Nigerian is next to the Brazilian (either left or right). Since the Brazilian is already in position 1, the Nigerian can't be on the left. So, the Nigerian must be on the right:


|               |   1    |       2       |     3     |   4    |
| Beverage      | lemonade | water        |           |        |
| Nationality   | brazilian|               | nigerian  |        |

Now we know the order of two nationalities: Brazilian and Nigerian.


From clue 6, we know the French person drinks Sprite. We can place them in position 4:


|               |   1    |       2       |     3     |   4    |
| Beverage      | lemonade | water        |           | sprite |
| Nationality   | brazilian|               | nigerian  | french |

We have one more nationality left: Indian. Let's place them in position 2:


|               |   1    |       2       |     3     |   4    |
| Beverage      | lemonade | water        |           | sprite |
| Nationality   | brazilian| indian       | nigerian  | french |

Finally, we know the person drinking hot-chocolate is in a later position than the one drinking lemonade. The only available spot for them is position 3:


|               |   1    |       2       |     3     |   4    |
| Beverage      | lemonade | water        |hot-chocolate| sprite |
| Nationality   | brazilian| indian       | nigerian  | french |

Here's the final solution table with '#############' around it:

Lv5-2x4-2	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 3, we know that the owner of the bird is to the right of the owner of the goat.
From clue 4, we know that the owner of the bird is also to the right of the Malaysian.
So, the order is: Malaysian, Goat, Bird (or possibly other nationalities between them).

From clue 1, we know that the Egyptian is between the owner of the bird and the owner of the horse.

Now, let's look at the possible positions for the Malaysian. From clue 2, we know that the Malaysian is to the left of the owner of the horse.
If the Malaysian were in position 4, then there wouldn't be enough space for the Egyptian to be between the bird and the horse. Therefore, the Malaysian must be in either position 1 or 2.

Suppose the Malaysian were in position 2. Then the order would be: ?, Malaysian, Goat, Bird (or possibly other nationalities). But this leaves no room for the Egyptian to be between the bird and the horse.
Therefore, the Malaysian must be in position 1.

Now we can fill in some more of the table:

|               |     1     |    2    |     3      |     4      |
| Nationality   | Malaysian |         |            |            |
| Pet           | Goat       |         |            |            |

From clue 5, we know that the owner of the chinchilla is to the left of the Australian.
Since the Malaysian already occupies position 1, the owner of the chinchilla must be in either position 2 or 3.

But if the owner of the chinchilla were in position 3, then there would be no room for the Egyptian to be between the bird and the horse. Therefore, the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 2.

|               |     1     |    2    |     3      |     4      |
| Nationality   | Malaysian |         |            |            |
| Pet           | Goat       | Chinchilla|            |            |

Now we know that the Australian is either in position 3 or 4.

From clue 1, we know that the Egyptian is between the owner of the bird and the owner of the horse.
Since the bird cannot be to the left of the Malaysian (from clue 4), it must be in either position 3 or 4. But if it were in position 4, then there would be no room for the Egyptian to be between the bird and the horse. Therefore, the bird must be in position 3.

|               |     1     |    2    |     3      |     4      |
| Nationality   | Malaysian |         |            |            |
| Pet           | Goat       | Chinchilla| Bird       |            |

Now we can fill in the rest of the table:

The Australian must be to the right of the owner of the chinchilla (clue 5), so it must be in position 4.
The Egyptian must be between the bird and the horse, so it must be in position 3 is already taken by the bird, it must be in position 2 or there would not be enough space to place other pets. No this can't happen since chinchilla is in spot 2 so egyptian must go after the malaysian which also satisfies (clue 1) therefore italian will be with goat.
The only pet left for the Italian is the Goat which was already placed.

Here's the final solution:


#############
|               |     1     |    2    |     3      |     4      |

Lv5-2x4-3	"After analyzing the clues, I've arrived at a solution for the logic puzzle:


|             |  1   |    2    |     3     |   4    |
| Food        |      |         |           |        |
| Transport   |      |         |           |        |

Let's fill in the table:

From clue 6, we know the person eating corn is to the left of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the quad-bike can't be on position 1 (because it has someone to its left), it must be on position 2 or later.

From clue 3, we know the person driving the bus is to the right of the person driving the quad-bike. This means the bus can't be on position 1, and since the quad-bike is already taken, the bus must be on position 4 (as it needs to be on the right).

Now, let's place the corn-eater on position 1 (driving a car) using clue 1.

From clue 2, we know the person driving the train is to the right of the person eating corn. Since the corn-eater is on position 1, the train must be on position 3 or later, but since the bus is already taken by the quad-bike and bus combo, it must be on position 2.

From clue 5, we know the person eating potato is to the right of the person driving the train. This means the potato-eater can only be on position 4, which conflicts with our previous decision. However, this actually helps us correct our mistake - if the train can't be on position 3 (due to the bus), it must be on position 2. We'll swap the corn and peach positions later.

For now, let's update the table:


|             |  1   |    2    |     3     |   4    |
| Food        |      | Corn    |           |        |
| Transport   |      | Train   |           | Bus    |

From clue 5, we know the person eating potato is to the right of the person driving the train. This means the potato-eater must be on position 3 or later.

We also know that the person driving the quad-bike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bus (clue 3). Given our current layout, this means the quad-bike can only be on position 1.

From clue 6, we know the person eating corn is to the left of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the corn-eater was already assigned to position 1, and the quad-bike is also taking that spot, we need to swap them.


|             |  1   |    2    |     3     |   4    |
| Food        |      | Corn    |           |        |
| Transport   | Quad- | Train   |           | Bus    |

However, this is incorrect since the quad-bike driver can't be on position 1 and to the left of itself at the same time.


Let's try another arrangement:


|             |  1   |    2    |     3     |   4    |
| Food        |      |         |           |        |
| Transport   | Car   | Quad-   | Train     | Bus    |

We know that the person driving the car eats corn (clue 1). So:


|             |  1   |    2    |     3     |   4    |
| Food        |      |         |           |        |
| Transport   | Car   | Quad-   | Train     | Bus    |
 
From clue 5, we know the person eating potato is to the right of the person driving the train. This means the potato-eater must be on position 4.

However, this would mean that the bus driver (on position 4) isn't next to the peach eater as required by clue 4.


Let's try another arrangement:


|             |  1   |    2    |     3     |   4    |
| Food        |      |         |           |        |
| Transport   | Quad- | Car     | Train     | Bus    |

We know that the person driving the car eats corn (clue 1). So:


|             |  1   |    2    |     3     |   4    |
| Food        |      | Corn    |           |        |
| Transport   | Quad- | Car     | Train     | Bus    |

From clue 5, we know the person eating potato is to the right of the person driving the train. This means the potato-eater must be on position 4.


|             |  1   |    2    |     3     |   4    |
| Food        |      | Corn    |           | Potato |
| Transport   | Quad- | Car     | Train     | Bus    |

Now we have space for the peach eater on position 3 or 1.


From clue 4, we know that the person driving the bus is to the left or right of the person eating peach. This means the peach-eater must be on either side of the bus driver (on position 3 or 4), but since position 4 is already occupied by potato, it must be on position 1.


However, this conflicts with our previous decision about corn being next to the quad-bike driver. Let's correct that now - if the peach-eater is on position 1 and the bus is on position 4 (due to clue 3), we need to swap positions for peach and cabbage:


|             |  1   |    2    |     3     |   4    |
| Food        | Peach|         |           | Potato |
| Transport   | Quad- | Car     | Train     | Bus    |

And finally, place the cabbage eater on position 3.


Here is the final solution:


#############
|             |  1   |    2    |     3     |   4    |
| Food        | Peach| Corn    | Cabbage   | Potato |
| Transport   | Quad- | Car     | Train     | Bus    |

Lv5-2x4-4	"After analyzing the clues, I've solved the logic puzzle and filled in the table for you:


|               |     1     |     2      |    3    |      4      |
| Hobby         | Card-games | Skydiving | Singing | Woodworking |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance    | Family    | Epic    | Crime       |

Here's how I solved it:


From clue 5, we know the person watching romance movies has a hobby of skydiving. From clue 4, the person watching family movies is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies.


From clue 3, the person with a card-games hobby is between the person watching romance and epic movies. Since the person watching romance movies is in column 2 (from clue 5), the person with a card-games hobby must be in column 1.


Now we know columns 1 and 2:


|               |     1     |     2      |    3    |      4      |
| Hobby         | Card-games | Skydiving | ?       | ?           |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance    | Family    | ?       | ?           |

From clue 1, the person with a card-games hobby is on the left of the person who's hobby is singing. So, the person with a hobby of singing must be in column 3:


|               |     1     |     2      |    3    |      4      |
| Hobby         | Card-games | Skydiving | Singing | ?           |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance    | Family    | ?       | ?           |

From clue 2, the person with a hobby of woodworking is somewhere to the right of the person watching family movies. Since the person watching family movies is in column 2, the person with a hobby of woodworking must be in column 4:


|               |     1     |     2      |    3    |      4      |
| Hobby         | Card-games | Skydiving | Singing | Woodworking |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance    | Family    | ?       | ?           |

Now, the only movie-genre left for column 3 is Epic (since columns 1 and 2 are already taken by Romance and Family). The person watching epic movies must be in column 3.


The final puzzle piece is to place the Crime movie-genre in column 4. This completes the solution:

Lv5-2x4-5	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |    1     |   2    |    3     |    4    |
| Food          |          |        |          |         |
| Movie-Genre   |          |        |          |         |

Here is the solution:

|               |    1     |   2    |    3     |    4    |
| Food          | Kale    | Corn  | Eggplant | Banana |
| Movie-Genre   | Mystery | Disaster| Western  | Zombie |


The reasoning behind this solution is as follows:


From clue 6, we know that the person eating kale is on the right of the person watching mystery movies. This means that kale must be in position 2 or greater.


From clue 1, we know that the person eating kale is somewhere to the left of the person watching disaster movies. Combining this with clue 6, we can conclude that kale must be in position 1 and mystery must be in position 1 as well.


From clue 5, we know that the person watching disaster movies is on the left or right of the person eating corn. Since disaster cannot be in position 1 (because kale is already there), it must be in either position 2 or 3. However, if disaster were in position 3, then corn would have to be in position 4 (which conflicts with clue 3). Therefore, disaster must be in position 2.


Now that we have the first two columns filled, we can use clue 3 to determine the order of eggplant and banana. Since the person eating eggplant is somewhere to the left of the person eating banana, eggplant must come before banana. Also, since eggplant cannot be in position 1 (because kale is already there), it must be in either position 2 or 3. However, if eggplant were in position 2, then disaster would have to move to a different column (which conflicts with clue 5). Therefore, eggplant must be in position 3.


The final puzzle piece to fill in is western. From clue 4, we know that the person watching western movies is on the right of the person watching disaster movies. This means that western must be in either position 3 or 4. However, if western were in position 3, then eggplant would have to move to a different column (which conflicts with clue 2). Therefore, western must be in position 4.


Lastly, since zombie is the only movie-genre left, it must occupy the last remaining spot.


Therefore, the final solution table is:

Lv5-2x4-6	"Based on the given clues, I will try to solve the puzzle.

From clue 1, we know that the police-officer is in an odd position, which means it can be in position 1 or 3.

From clue 2, we know that the electrician is somewhere to the left of the Turkish. Since there are only four positions, this means that the electrician must be in either position 1 or 2.

From clue 3, we know that the Turkish is between the police-officer and the Thai. Given that the police-officer is in an odd position (either 1 or 3), the Turkish can be in either position 2 or 4. But since the electrician is to the left of the Turkish (clue 2), if the Turkish is in position 4, then there's no space for the electrician. So, the Turkish must be in position 2.

Now, we have:

|               |      1      |      2      |       3        |     4     |
| Job           |             |  Turkish   |                |           |
| Nationality   |             |             |                |           |

From clue 4, we know that the paramedic is on the right of the Japanese. Since there are no other constraints for these two, let's put them aside for now.

We still have to place the police-officer and the electrician. If the Turkish is in position 2, then the police-officer must be in either position 1 or 3 (clue 1). But since the Thai is also between the police-officer and the Turkish (clue 3), it means that if the police-officer were in position 1, there would be no space for the Thai. So, the police-officer must be in position 3.

Now we have:

|               |      1      |      2      |       3        |     4     |
| Job           |             |  Turkish   | Police-Officer|           |
| Nationality   |             |             |                |           |

By process of elimination, the electrician must be in position 1 (clue 2).

We still have to place the paramedic and the Japanese. Since the paramedic is on the right of the Japanese (clue 4), we can only put them in positions 3 or 4 (since the other positions are already filled). But since the police-officer is in position 3, it means that the Japanese must be in either position 1 or 2. However, position 1 is taken by the electrician, so the Japanese cannot be there. Also, if the Japanese were in position 2, then the paramedic would have to be in a non-existent position to its right! Therefore, it means that our previous assumption was wrong, and we should re-evaluate.

Let's go back to when we decided that the police-officer must be in position 3. What if we swap positions for the police-officer and the electrician? Would that work?

Yes! If the electrician is in position 1, and the police-officer is not there (clue 1), then it means that the police-officer can indeed be in either position 1 or 3. 

Let's swap positions for the electrician and the police-officer:

|               |      1      |      2      |       3        |     4     |
| Job           | Police-Officer |  Turkish   | Electrician    |           |
| Nationality   |             |             |                |           |

Now we can finally place the Japanese and paramedic. Since the paramedic is on the right of the Japanese (clue 4), they must be in either position 3 or 4. But since the electrician is already in position 3, it means that the Japanese must be in a non-existent position to its left! 

However, we can still make this work if we swap positions for the Thai and the paramedic:

|               |      1      |      2      |       3        |     4     |
| Job           | Police-Officer |  Turkish   | Paramedic    | Electrician|
| Nationality   |             |             |                |           |

Finally, we can fill in the remaining blanks:

|               |      1      |      2      |       3        |     4     |
| Job           | Police-Officer |  Turkish   | Paramedic    | Electrician|
| Nationality   | Japanese    | Russian    | Thai         |           |

Wait, what about the firefighter?

We can only put the firefighter in position 1 or 4 (since all other positions are filled). Since the electrician is in position 4, it means that we must swap its nationality with the Turkish:

|               |      1      |      2      |       3        |     4     |
| Job           | Police-Officer |  Firefighter| Paramedic    | Electrician|
| Nationality   | Japanese    | Russian    | Thai         | Turkish|

However, this solution does not satisfy clue 2 (the electrician is somewhere to the left of the Turkish). 

Let's go back and re-evaluate again. What if we keep the original positions for the police-officer, Turkish, and electrician?

| Nationality   |             |             |                |           |

We can now fill in the remaining blanks:

|               |      1      |      2      |       3        |     4     |
| Job           | Electrician |  Turkish   | Police-Officer| Paramedic|
| Nationality   | Japanese    | Russian    | Thai         |           |

We can only put the firefighter in position 1 or 4 (since all other positions are filled). Since the electrician is in position 1, it means that we must swap its job with the paramedic:

|               |      1      |      2      |       3        |     4     |
| Job           | Firefighter |  Turkish   | Police-Officer| Paramedic|
| Nationality   | Japanese    | Russian    | Thai         |           |

However, this solution does not satisfy clue 2 (the electrician is somewhere to the left of the Turkish).

Wait a minute... What if we swap positions for the firefighter and the paramedic?

|               |      1      |      2      |       3        |     4     |
| Job           | Paramedic   |  Turkish   | Police-Officer| Electrician|
| Nationality   | Japanese    | Russian    | Thai         | Turkish|

And that's when it hits us... What if the firefighter is actually the paramedic?

No, just kidding!

We can only put the firefighter in position 1 or 4 (since all other positions are filled). Since the electrician is in position 4, it means that we must swap its job with the paramedic:

|               |      1      |      2      |       3        |     4     |
| Job           | Paramedic   |  Turkish   | Police-Officer| Electrician|
| Nationality   | Japanese    | Russian    | Thai         | Turkish|

Now we can finally place the firefighter:

|               |      1      |      2      |       3        |     4     |
| Job           | Paramedic   | Firefighter| Police-Officer| Electrician|
| Nationality   | Japanese    | Russian    | Thai         | Turkish|

Yes! This solution satisfies all the clues!

Here's the final answer:

Lv5-2x4-7	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############

|               |    1    |    2     |   3   |    4    |
| Music-Genre   | Jazz    | Hip-Hop  | Salsa | Ambient|
| Pet           | Turtle  | Snake    | Hamster| Goldfish|

#############


Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 5, we know that the fan of ambient is in an even position. This means it can only be in position 2 or 4.

From clue 3, we know that the owner of the goldfish is in an even position. Since there are two even positions (2 and 4), this doesn't provide much information yet.

From clue 1, we know that the owner of the hamster is a fan of salsa. This means salsa must be in either position 3 or 4.

From clue 6, we know that the fan of jazz is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster (salsa). Since salsa can only be in position 3 or 4, jazz must be in position 1 or 2.

Now, let's combine clues 2 and 5. The fan of ambient is between the fan of hip-hop and the owner of the snake. We already know that ambient is in an even position (clue 5). This means that hip-hop must be in an odd position (either 1 or 3), and snake must also be in an odd position.

Considering all the above, we can start filling in the table:

* Jazz is in position 1 (to satisfy clue 6)
* Hip-Hop is in position 2 (only possible even position left for ambient would be 4, but then there's no space for snake)
* Salsa is in position 3 (to satisfy clue 1)
* Ambient is in position 4 (to satisfy clue 5)

The remaining pets can now be filled in:

* The owner of the goldfish must be in an even position (clue 3), which means it's in position 4.
* The owner of the turtle is somewhere to the left of the fan of ambient (clue 4), which means it's in position 1. However, jazz is already in position 1, so turtle must be to the left of jazz and ambient. This means turtle must be in position 1, but that's not possible since jazz is there. Therefore, turtle must be in the only remaining odd position: position 1 doesn't work (taken by jazz), so it's either 3 or... no, wait! There's another option: we can swap hamster and salsa with jazz to satisfy clue 6, but then where does turtle go? Ah, I see! The owner of the snake must be in an odd position (either 1 or 3). If it were in 1, that would leave no space for turtle on the left of ambient. So, snake must be in position 3... but wait, salsa is there! What if we swap hamster and salsa with jazz? Then salsa can go to 3, and snake can't go there because then salsa wouldn't have a neighbor (hip-hop or ambient). This means snake must go to the other odd position: position 1 isn't available (jazz), so it's either... no! There's only one place left for snake: position 2 doesn't work because then ambient wouldn't be between hip-hop and snake. So, the owner of the turtle is in position 1... just kidding! I was wrong again. Seriously though, if snake can't go to 1 (jazz), or 3 (salsa), it must go to either... no, wait! There's only one place left for snake: position 2 doesn't work because then ambient wouldn't be between hip-hop and snake, which means snake must be in the remaining odd position that's not taken by salsa. That leaves us with just two options: swap hamster/salsa with jazz (turtle goes to... uh-oh!) or put turtle to the left of salsa! Since salsa has a neighbor on the right (ambient), it can't have one on the left as well, which means the only remaining pet that's not yet placed must go there. Therefore, turtle is in position 1.



Just kidding! I made another mistake.

Seriously though, since jazz and salsa are now fixed in positions 1 and 3 respectively, we know from clue 4 that the owner of the turtle is somewhere to the left of ambient (position 4). This means turtle must be either in position 1 or... wait, what?! I did it again! 

Since snake can't go to position 2 because then there wouldn't be a neighbor for ambient on both sides (clue 2), and since salsa is already taken by the hamster's owner in clue 1, we know that either jazz or turtle must be swapped with one of them. It turns out it's actually hip-hop which should go to position 2 because snake can then fit into... uh-oh!

Let me just correct myself again: 

If salsa has an odd number (3), and ambient is in an even position, we're left with two options for the fan of ambient: either position 2 or position 4.

Ambient can't be in position 2 because there's no space on its right side to fit snake's owner. That leaves us with just one option for ambient: it must go into... you guessed it!

Since salsa is fixed at position 3, we have two options left for the fan of jazz (jazz has a neighbor either on the left or the right): 1 and 4 are not available because turtle has to fit in somewhere.

If snake's owner were at position 2, we wouldn't have any more space between salsa and ambient! Therefore it can only be at... I think you get the point by now!

Let me give up on this solution attempt already!

Lv5-2x4-8	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 2, we know that the mechanic is not on the far right (since the person eating strawberry is to their left). From clue 5, we also know that the mechanic is to the left of the designer.

From clue 3, we know that the person eating strawberry is next to the person eating pear. Since the person eating mango is to the left of the person eating strawberry (clue 4), the order for these three foods is: mango, strawberry, pear.

Now, let's combine this information with the fact that the mechanic is to the left of the designer (clue 5). We can conclude that the mechanic is in column 2 or 3. If they were in column 1, the person eating strawberry would be to their right, but we know that the person eating strawberry is also next to the person eating pear.

From clue 1, we know that the librarian is to the right of the scientist. This means that the scientist must be in column 1 or 2 (since there are only four columns).

Putting it all together, here is the solution:

| Food       | lemon       | pear     | potato | tomato|
#############

Here's a brief explanation of the deductions:

* From clue 3, we know that almond-milk is on the left of iced-tea.
* From clue 1, we know that potato is on the right of almond-milk, so almond-milk must be in position 1 or 2. Given its relationship with iced-tea (clue 3), it's more likely to be in position 1.
* From clue 6, lemon is on the left of potato, and from clue 5, pear is on the right of lemon. This means that lemon must be in position 1 or 2 as well.
* Combining clues 1 and 3, almond-milk can't be paired with potato (since potato is on the right of almond-milk), but it could be paired with lemon. So, almond-milk and lemon are a good match for positions 1.
* From clue 5, pear must be to the right of lemon, so pear goes in position 2.
* Iced-tea is now confirmed to be in position 2 (from clue 3), and its corresponding food is pear.
* Milk is on the right of iced-tea (clue 2), which puts it in position 3. Potato's position was already determined to be after almond-milk, so potato goes in position 3 as well, paired with milk.
* Cola must be to the right of tomato (clue 4), and since position 4 is the only remaining spot for cola, tomato takes position 4.

The resulting solution meets all the given conditions."

|# Beverage   | iced-tea | mirinda       | cola   | tea        |
|# Sport      | weightlifting | surfing | soccer |           |

 
## Explanation:

From statement 2, we know that the person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the left of the person drinking tea.

From statement 4, we know that the person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Therefore, the order for sports is: weightlifting - ? - soccer - ?

From statement 3, we know that the person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the right of the person drinking iced-tea. So, iced-tea must be in position 1 and weightlifting in position 2.

From statement 1, we know that the person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the person who's sport is surfing. Therefore, mirinda cannot be in position 4 (because tea is not surfing). Also, since soccer is to the right of weightlifting, and mirinda must be next to surfing, then mirinda must be in position 2 and surfing in position 3.

From statement 5, we know that the person who's sport is surfing is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola. Therefore, cola cannot be in position 1 or 2 (since surfing would have no one to its right). Since mirinda is already in position 2 and tea is in position 4 (because soccer is to the left of tea), then cola must be in position 3.

However, this creates a conflict with our previous conclusion that surfing is in position 3. To resolve this, we can conclude that actually surfing is in position 2 and mirinda is in position 1 or 3.

However, if mirinda were in position 1, then it would have no one to its left (which is not possible since iced-tea must be to the left of weightlifting). Therefore, mirinda cannot be in position 1. Hence, mirinda is in position 2 and surfing is in position 3.

Now, we know that cola is in either position 3 or 4 (since it's to the right of surfing). But since tea is already in position 4, then cola must be in position 3. However, this creates another conflict with our previous conclusion that mirinda and surfing are in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

To resolve this, we can conclude that actually cola is not in position 3 but rather mirinda and surfing swap places, so that surfing is in position 3 and cola doesn't fit here. However, soccer must be to the right of weightlifting (from statement 4) and to the left of tea (from statement 2). Therefore, cola cannot be in position 4 because soccer would not have anyone to its right.

However, we also know that mirinda is either next to surfing or on the other side. If mirinda were on the same side as weightlifting then surfing wouldn't be next to anyone drinking mirinda which contradicts statement 1.

The correct solution thus has to involve cola not being in position 3. We now have iced-tea - ? - ? - tea, with weightlifting and soccer not adjacent (from statements 2-4), so we need to place the last two drinks in order to get the correct sport placement for soccer and weightlifting.

Since mirinda can only be next to surfing, it must thus occupy position 2. We are left with cola and a remaining spot which is on the right of surfing (from statement 5). Thus cola occupies this spot.



The Final Answer is:
