Lv5-6x3-1	"After analyzing the clues, I've filled in the table with the solution:

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 9, we know that video-games is on the far left.
* From clue 5, social-worker is to the right of rock, so rock must be in position 1. Blueberry must be in position 2 (since social-worker is to the left of blueberry).
* From clue 4, garlic is either on the far left or far right. Since video-games is already on the far left, garlic must be on the far right.
* From clue 3, documentary is to the left of writing, so writing can't be in position 1 (since documentary would have to be to its left). Writing must be in position 3.
* From clue 7, hiking is to the left of thriller. Since hiking can't be in position 3 (writing), hiking must be in position 2, and thriller must be in position 1 (but this conflicts with rock being in position 1, so we adjust: sailing is actually in position 1, and hiking/thriller are swapped to positions 2/1 respectively).
* From clue 2, project-manager is to the right of apricot. Since apricot can't be in position 3 (garlic), apricot must be in position 2.
* From clue 6, social-worker is to the right of rock. This confirms that social-worker is indeed in position 1.
* From clue 8, sports is to the right of garlic, so sports must be in position 3.
* The remaining positions can be filled in based on the constraints.

I hope this explanation helps!

#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:

* From clue 4, we know that board-games is to the left of spy movies. Clue 2 tells us that spy movies are between mexican and pepper, so we can place spy movies in column 2.
* Clue 3 places chess next to turkish, but since turkish can't be in column 1 (due to clue 7), it must be in column 3. This means chess is in column 2.
* Clue 5 tells us that board-games is to the left of frog. Since spy movies are already in column 2, board-games must be in column 1.
* Clue 6 places guinea-pig next to rat, and clue 7 says the owner of the rat is right of british. This means the pet order is frog, guinea-pig, rat from left to right.
* Clue 8 says mango is next to sprite. Since pumpkin is already on the right (due to clue 1), mango must be in column 1, and sprite must be in column 2.
* Clue 9 tells us that water is to the left of cola. This means water must be in column 1, and cola must be in column 3.

Lv5-6x3-3	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:

| Transport     | Jet-ski       | Subway    | Van          |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 8, we know the fisherman is on the far left.
* From clue 12, we know the architect is on the left of the Argentine, and from clue 3, we know the Argentine is either on the far left or far right. Since the fisherman is already on the far left, the Argentine must be on the far right.
* From clue 11, we know the architect is to the right of the person driving the jet-ski. This means the jet-ski driver must be in position 1.
* From clue 1, we know the subway driver is in the middle, so they must be in position 2.
* From clue 4, we know the van driver's hobby is singing. Since the architect is already accounted for in position 2 or 3, the singer must be in position 3.
* From clue 5, we know the rock-climber is Turkish and has an odd position number. This means they must be in position 3, but since the singer is already there, this clue actually tells us that the rock-climber is in position 1 or 3 (since it's an odd position). However, from clue 7, we know the lime-eater is to the right of the Turkish person. This means the Turkish person can't be on the far right, so they must be in position 1.
* From clue 6, we know the gardener is to the left or right of the hip-hop fan. Since the architect and singer are already accounted for, this means the gardener must be in position 1 (left of the hip-hop fan).
* From clue 3, we know the broccoli-eater is to the left of the hip-hop fan. This means the broccoli-eater must be in position 2.
* The remaining positions can be filled in using the process of elimination and considering the constraints from the other clues.

Note that there are some indirect connections between the clues, but this solution should satisfy all the given conditions."
Lv5-6x3-4	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a solution for the logic puzzle:

* From clue 1, we know that the librarian is to the left of the person who's sport is rowing. Since rowing is in column 3, the librarian must be in column 2 or 1. But from clue 7, we know that tea (which is also rowing) is between cucumber and zombie movies. So, the librarian must be in column 3.
* From clue 6, we know that pomegranate is on the left or right of the architect. Since the architect is not in column 1 (because of clue 5), it must be in column 2, with pomegranate in column 1 or 3. But from clue 7, we know that tea is between cucumber and zombie movies. So, pomegranate must be in column 2.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 3, the fan of techno is on the far right.
* Clue 12 tells us that the fan of techno drives the car, so the person in column 3 drinks lemonade and eats watermelon (clue 1).
* Clues 4 and 5 suggest that the fan of punk and the person drinking 7up are on the far left or right. Since the far right is taken by the techno fan, they must be on the far left.
* Clue 2 tells us that the person driving the train is next to the punk fan, which means the train driver is in column 2.
* From clue 9, the person watching crime movies eats cauliflower and is therefore in column 3.
* Clues 6 and 7 indicate that the person watching sports movies is on the left of the crime movie fan, so they must be in column 1. The cauliflower eater (crime movie fan) is also to the right of the rabbit owner (clue 7), which means the rabbit owner is in column 2.
* Clues 8 and 10 indicate that the person watching mystery movies is next to the 7up drinker, who is on the far left.
* Finally, clue 11 tells us that the ferret owner is next to the skateboard rider. Since the train driver is already in column 2, the ferret owner must be in column 1.

#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 2, we know the fan of ambient is to the right of the freelancer. Since the freelancer must be in column 1 or 2 (due to clues 5 and 1), we can place the fan of ambient in column 2.
* Clue 3 tells us that fishing is on the right of the freelancer, so it goes in column 2 or 3. However, clue 7 says traveling is on the right of the American (who must be watching western movies, per clue 4), so traveling can't be in column 1. This means fishing must be in column 2.
* With the fan of ambient already in column 2, and fishing taking its place, we know collecting must be in column 1.
* The freelancer is on the left of the fan of funk (clues 5 and 1), so it can't be in column 3. This means the social-worker must be in column 2, and the photographer in column 3.
* Clue 8 says martial-arts movies are watched by the fan of house music, which is not on the left of cricket (clue 9). Therefore, martial-arts must be in column 3.
* The American watches western movies (clue 4), and traveling is to their right (clue 7). This means satire movies are in column 1.
* Clue 6 tells us that the Malaysian is to the left of cycling. Since cycling can't be in column 1, it must be in either column 2 or 3. But clue 9 says cricket is on the right of ambient music, which we already placed in column 2. Therefore, cycling must be in column 3.
* Finally, this leaves water-polo for column 2.

 Let me explain the steps I took to solve this puzzle:


1. From clue 7, we know that strawberry is on the far right.
2. From clue 9, papaya is somewhere to the right of water, so papaya can't be in position 1.
3. From clue 2, papaya is mexican, and from clue 4, french is somewhere to the right of photographer, which means that french can only be in position 3.
4. Now we have two options for mexican: positions 1 or 2. If mexican was in position 1, then water would have to be on the far left (clue 9), and milk would have to be in the middle (as coffee is even). However, this contradicts clue 8 (water is on either side of hiking).
5. Therefore, mexican must be in position 2.
6. From clue 3, coffee is somewhere to the right of electrician. Since electrician can't be in position 1 (coffee would then have to be in an odd position), electrician must be in position 2 or 3. However, since mexican is already in position 2, electrician must be in position 3.
7. Now we know that coffee is on the right of electrician, and coffee is even, so it must be in position 2. 
8. We also know that milk is somewhere to the left of coffee (since water can't be next to hiking), and milk must be on the far left since water would have to be on either side of hiking.
9. From clue 6, photography is somewhere to the left of classical music. So photography must be in position 1 or 2. However, if photography was in position 2, then classical music would be on the right of card-games (from clue 5), which is not possible since funk and d&b are already taken by positions 1 and 3 respectively.
10. Therefore, photography must be in position 1.
11. From clue 5, funk is on the left of card-games, so it must be in either position 1 or 2. However, if funk was in position 2, then d&b would have to be next to hiking (as classical music can't be), which means that water wouldn't be able to be next to hiking.
12. Therefore, funk is on the far left, and card-games must be in the middle.
13. Finally, from clue 6 again, photography's hobby is somewhere to the left of classical, so d&b must be in position 2.

With these steps, we have arrived at our final solution table:

| Transport     | roller     | jet-ski  | tram          |

 #############


Here's a brief explanation of my thought process:

From clue 8, we know the librarian is on the far right. From clue 11, the owner of the rabbit is in an odd position, which means they're either in position 1 or 3.


Using clue 7, we can determine that the person driving the jet-ski is between the person driving the tram and the owner of the fish. This helps us place the jet-ski driver in position 2, with the tram driver on one side and the fish owner on the other.


From clue 5, we know the paramedic is on the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the paramedic can't be on the far right (occupied by the librarian), they must be in position 2. This also helps us place the milk drinker in position 2.


Now, using clue 6, we know the lemonade drinker is on the left or right of the fan of blues. Since the paramedic (in position 2) can't be next to the lemonade drinker (due to clue 5), the lemonade drinker must be in position 3.


With clue 10, we know the person drinking 7up is somewhere to the right of the paramedic. This means the 7up drinker must be in position 1 or 3. Since position 3 is already occupied by the lemonade drinker, the 7up drinker must be in position 1.


From clue 4, we know the fan of blues is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. This helps us place the fan of blues in position 2 or 3. However, since position 3 is already occupied by the lemonade drinker (who can't be a fan of blues due to clue 6), the fan of blues must be in position 2.


Now, using clue 9, we know the owner of the rat is on the left of the fan of folk. This helps us place the owner of the rat in position 1 or 2. Since position 1 is already occupied by the 7up drinker (who can't own a rat due to clue 11), the owner of the rat must be in position 2.


Finally, using clue 3, we know the person who's sport is rowing is on the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. This helps us place the rowing enthusiast in position 1 or 2. Since position 1 is already occupied by the 7up drinker (who can't be a rowing enthusiast due to clue 3), the rowing enthusiast must be in position 2.

* From clue 2, the journalist must be in column 2, and since the person drinking water is to their right (clue 5), the journalist must drink cola.
* Clue 6 tells us that the owner of the rabbit is on the right of the person drinking 7up. Since there's only one pet left for each person, the person drinking 7up must be in column 1.
* From clue 9, we know the person eating mango is to the left of the ice-hockey player. The only available spot for this is column 1 (mango) and column 2 (ice-hockey).
* Clue 4 states that the ice-hockey player is on the left of the water-polo player, which puts the water-polo player in column 3.
* From clue 8, we know the turtle's owner is to the left of the person driving the quad-bike. Since there's only one pet left for each person, this must be columns 2 and 3.
* Clue 1 says that the car driver is on the right of the skateboarder. Given the already placed people and pets, this puts the car in column 3 and the skateboard in column 1.
* Finally, from clue 7, we know the apple-eater must be to the left of the zucchini-eater. This places them in columns 2 and 3, respectively.

From clue 4, we know the person drinking cola is to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the person eating carrot is already on the far left, hot-chocolate must be in position 1.

Clue 9 tells us that the owner of the mouse is in an odd position. Given the other constraints, this means the mouse owner must be in position 1. Clue 7 tells us that the owner of the mouse is to the left of the person eating garlic. Therefore, garlic must be in position 2.

From clue 5, we know the person driving the tram is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the person eating carrot (and therefore hot-chocolate) is already on the far left, the tram driver cannot be in position 1. Clue 8 tells us that the journalist is to the right of the person driving the tram. Therefore, the journalist must be in position 3.

From clue 11, we know the person eating carrot is either on the far left or far right (but since they're already on the far left, this doesn't add any new information).

Clue 2 and 12 tell us that the owner of the rat is to the right of the person whose sport is volleyball, and to the left of the person whose sport is badminton. Given the other constraints, this means the rat owner must be in position 3.

From clue 1 (which seems to be a duplicate of clue 2), we know that the person whose sport is badminton must be to the right of the person driving the tram (since the rat owner is to their left).

Clue 3 tells us that the security-guard is between the person driving the roller and the person driving the tram. Given the other constraints, this means the security-guard must be in position 2.

The remaining positions can be filled in based on the process of elimination.
