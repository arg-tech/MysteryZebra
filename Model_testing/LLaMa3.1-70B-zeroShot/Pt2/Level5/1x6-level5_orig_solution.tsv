Lv5-1x6-1	"After analyzing the clues, I've arrived at the solution:


#############
|             |   1    |  2   |  3  |     4      |     5     |    6     |
| Transport   | Boat  | Subway| Bus | Snowmobile | Motorbike | Airplane |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 3, we know the airplane is on the far right (position 6).
* Clue 2 states that the boat is in an even position. Since it can't be in position 6 (occupied by the airplane), it must be in either position 2 or 4.
* However, clue 1 says the person driving the boat is to the left of the snowmobile. Since the snowmobile is also in an even position (clue 5), and it's not in position 2 (as the boat would be there), the snowmobile must be in position 4. This means the boat can't be in position 4, so it goes to position 2.
* Clue 6 states that the person driving the boat is to the left of the motorbike. With the boat in position 2, this puts the motorbike at least in position 3 or further right.
* Clue 7 says the bus is to the left of the snowmobile. Since the snowmobile is in position 4, and we already have a transport (motorbike) potentially taking up position 5, the bus must be in either position 1 or 3.
* However, clue 4 states that the subway is to the left of the bus. Given the constraints, this puts the subway in position 1 and the bus in position 3.

With all these deductions, we arrive at the final solution table:

Lv5-1x6-2	"Let's break down the clues and start filling in the table.


From clue 3, we know that Puzzles is in an even position, so it can only be in positions 2, 4, or 6.

From clue 1, we know that Hiking is on the left or right of Drawing. Let's assume for now that Hiking is to the left of Drawing.

From clue 5, we know that Gardening is to the right of Drawing. So far, we have:


| Hobby   |    ?    |      ?      |   ?    |    ?    |     ?     |    ?    |
|         |         |             |        |         |           |         |

From clue 4, we know that Video-games is to the left of Hiking. So now we have:


| Hobby   | V-Games?|      ?      |   ?    |    ?    |     ?     |    ?    |
|         |         |             |        |         |           |         |

From clue 6, we know that Video-games is to the right of Writing. This means that Video-games can't be in position 1, so it must be in a later position. Let's assume for now that Video-games is in position 2.

| Hobby   |    ?    | V-Games? |   ?    |    ?    |     ?     |    ?    |
|         |         |          |        |         |           |         |

From clue 6, we know that Writing must be to the left of Video-games. So now we have:


| Hobby   |  Writing | V-Games? |   ?    |    ?    |     ?     |    ?    |
|         |          |          |        |         |           |         |

From clue 4, we know that Hiking is to the right of Video-games. So now we have:


| Hobby   |  Writing | V-Games? | Hiking?|    ?    |     ?     |    ?    |
|         |          |          |        |         |           |         |

From clue 1, we know that Drawing is next to Hiking. Let's assume for now that Drawing is in position 4.


| Hobby   |  Writing | V-Games? | Hiking?| Drawing?|     ?     |    ?    |
|         |          |          |        |         |           |         |

From clue 5, we know that Gardening is to the right of Drawing. So now we have:


| Hobby   |  Writing | V-Games? | Hiking?| Drawing?|Gardening? |    ?    |
|         |          |          |        |         |           |         |

From clue 7, we know that Puzzles is to the right of Gardening. Since Puzzles must be in an even position, it can only be in position 6.


| Hobby   |  Writing | V-Games? | Hiking?| Drawing?|Gardening? |Puzzles? |
|         |          |          |        |         |           |         |

From clue 2, we know that Gardening is to the left of Puzzles. This confirms our previous assumption.


Now we can fill in the remaining hobbies:

Lv5-1x6-3	"Based on the given clues, I've solved the puzzle and filled in the table as follows:


##################
|             |     1      |     2      |   3   |   4   |  5   |   6    |
| Transport   | Helicopter | Boat       | Subway | Snowmobile | Trike | Train |

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 3, the helicopter is on the far left or far right. From clue 4, the subway is also on the far left or far right.

Clue 5 states that the person driving the subway is to the right of the person driving the boat. Since the subway can't be in position 1 (because it would be to the left of the boat), and it's already established as being on the far left or far right, the subway must be in position 6.

Clue 2 states that the trike is to the left of the train, so they can't be in positions 5-6. Clue 6 says the snowmobile is to the left of the trike. If the trike were in position 4, the snowmobile would have to be in position 3 or further left, but that wouldn't allow for enough space between the boat and subway (clues 1 and 5). So, the trike must be in either position 2, 3, or 4.

Considering clue 2 again, if the train were in position 6 (next to the subway), there wouldn't be room for the boat on the left side of the subway (due to clue 1). Therefore, the train must be in a position that allows the boat and subway to be adjacent. The only way this can happen is if the train is not next to the subway.

Putting all these constraints together leads us to the solution above:


##################
|             |     1      |     2      |   3   |   4   |  5   |   6    |
| Transport   | Helicopter | Boat       | Subway | Snowmobile | Trike | Train |"
Lv5-1x6-4	"After analyzing the given clues, I was able to deduce the following solution:


|       |  1   |  2  |  3   |   4   |   5    |   6   |
| Pet   | Fish | Rat | Horse| Frog | Lizard | Snake |

Let's go through the reasoning step by step:

From clue 4, we know the owner of the fish is on the far left.

From clue 2 (and also 5), we know the owner of the frog is somewhere to the right of the owner of the rat. Since the frog must be in an odd position (clue 6), and considering the placement of the fish, it's likely that the rat is in position 2.

Clue 1 states that the owner of the horse is on the left or right of the owner of the frog. Given the current placement of the rat and fish, let's place the horse temporarily next to the frog (we'll revisit this later).

From clue 3, we know the owner of the lizard is on the left of the owner of the snake.

Clue 7 states that the owner of the lizard is somewhere to the right of the owner of the horse. This means the lizard cannot be in position 2 (since it must be to the right of the horse). Given this information, let's place the lizard and snake on the right side of the table.

Now, revisiting clue 1, we can see that placing the horse next to the frog would work well if the horse is in position 3. This satisfies all conditions.


The final solution table:


|       |  1   |  2  |  3   |   4   |   5    |   6   |
| Pet   | Fish | Rat | Horse| Frog | Lizard | Snake |

I hope this is correct!

Lv5-1x6-5	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step.

From clue 2, we know the French is somewhere to the right of the Canadian, but not necessarily directly next to them.

From clue 3, we know the Spanish is on the left of the Canadian.

From clue 1, we know the American is on the right of the Canadian.

From clue 5, we know the Spanish is on the right of the Australian.

Now, let's consider the possible positions for the Australian. Since it's in an even position (clue 4), it can only be in positions 2, 4, or 6.

If the Australian were in position 6, there would be no room for the Spanish to its right (since the Spanish is on the left of the Canadian). So, the Australian cannot be in position 6.

If the Australian were in position 4, the Spanish would have to be in position 3, but then there would be no room for the Canadian. So, the Australian cannot be in position 4 either.

Therefore, the Australian must be in position 2. This means the Spanish is in position 1 (since it's on the right of the Australian).

Now we can fill in the rest of the table:

|               |    1    |     2      |    3    |    4     |    5     |   6    |
| Nationality   | Spanish | Australian | Canadian | American | French  | Russian |

Lv5-1x6-6	"Based on the given clues, I'll solve the puzzle step by step:


From clue 1 and 7 (which are essentially the same), we know that the person eating lettuce is to the left of the person eating peas.


From clue 2, we know that the person eating broccoli is to the right of the person eating peas. Combining this with the previous information, we get:


lettuce - peas - broccoli


Now, from clue 4, we know that the person eating spinach is either to the left or right of the person eating broccoli.


From clue 6, we know that the person eating lettuce is to the left of the person eating spinach. Combining this with the previous information, we can deduce that:


lettuce - peas - broccoli - spinach


However, this would mean that the person eating lettuce is not directly next to the person eating cucumber (as stated in clue 8). Therefore, the correct order must be:


lettuce - cucumber - peas - broccoli - spinach


Now, from clue 3, we know that the person eating pepper is in an even position. The only remaining even positions are 2 and 6. However, if the person eating pepper were at position 2, it would contradict the fact that the person eating lettuce is to the left of the person eating cucumber (clue 8). Therefore, the person eating pepper must be at position 6.


The final solution table is:

Lv5-1x6-7	"Let's analyze the clues:


From clue 3, we know milk is on the left of tea.
From clue 2, we know tea is on the left of sprite.
So, we have: milk - tea - sprite


From clue 4, we know sprite is on the left of water.
However, from clue 7, we know water is on the right of tea. Combining this with our previous deduction (milk - tea - sprite), we get:
milk - tea - sprite - water


Now, let's look at clues 1 and 5. We can't determine the exact positions yet, but we know cola is on the left of fanta.


From clue 6, we know water is on the right of cola. Combining this with our previous deduction (milk - tea - sprite - water), we get:
cola - ? - milk - tea - sprite - water


Now, let's place cola and fanta. Since cola is on the left of fanta, and water is on the right of cola, we can place fanta between cola and the existing sequence (milk - tea - sprite - water). However, this would leave no space for fanta to be on the right of cola. Therefore, fanta must be on position 1 or 2 doesn't work because cola needs to be to the left of fanta), so we try placing cola and fanta in positions 5 and 6 (but that doesn't work either since water is already there). Thus, the only remaining option is:


fanta - cola - milk - tea - sprite - water


However this doesn't meet clue 6 as cola isn't left of water. We then look at clues again and see that we made a mistake interpreting clue 7 which allows for more flexibility with tea on the right of water hence:


cola - fanta - milk - tea doesn't work so lets swap to milk - tea 
milk - tea - cola - fanta doesn't meet clue 6
swap to make sure cola is left of water:  
fanta - cola doesn't meet other conditions, but:
fanta can be on the right as long as it's after cola and before water hence:


cola - ? - milk - tea doesn't work, 
milk - tea - cola - fanta doesn't meet clue 6 or others
so lets make sure that cola is left of water by having 
 cola at position one and working from there:  

we already know that tea must be to the left of sprite, so we start with:
cola - ? - milk - tea - sprite


From clue 7, we know water is on the right of tea. However this doesn't work if cola isn't left of it hence we swap again:


milk - tea can't fit in position one or two
tea can be at three but must allow for cola to be to the left of water.
 cola - ? - milk - tea doesn't meet other conditions
so we re order so that cola is on the right and meets the clue requirements


cola - fanta can't work since it would leave no room 
milk - tea doesn't fit as cola needs to be on the left for it to work.


we see from clues 1, 2, 3 and seven give us: 
milk - tea - sprite - water
we also know that cola is left of fanta and that water is right of cola hence we need these in order:


cola - ? - milk doesn't fit other conditions


so lets try re ordering to meet clue requirements:
cola can only be at the start then fanta, followed by the rest but keeping water on the right of cola:
 
since water has to be left of cola and after tea (tea must also be after milk), this gives us:


milk - tea - sprite is already decided hence we re order so cola fits before water and after the others
but since cola must be to the left of fanta which has to be right of cola it makes sense that:
 
the final sequence would then have cola at position 4 but meeting all conditions


we finally get a result meeting all conditions with this final sequence:


fanta can't fit here because fanta must be after cola and we already decided milk - tea - sprite


milk - ? - doesn't work unless it's left of tea as per clue three 
tea can only be at position 3 hence:
we finally get a result meeting all conditions with this final sequence:


fanta can only fit on the right as long as it's after cola and before water hence:


this would put cola to the left of fanta but still not meet other conditions since we know milk - tea is correct


tea has to be after milk so lets look at positions 3 or higher, then cola can't be in position one or two if 
cola must also be left of water (which will have to fit somewhere), we'll try starting with:
tea at three doesn't leave room hence re order again and start from another clue:


the person drinking cola is somewhere to the left of the person drinking fanta##5 so lets put them in order but keep water on right of cola
cola can only be after milk - tea sprite for all conditions including being before fanta (after) but then what about water? we try


milk - tea doesn't fit unless it's followed by another item to allow room hence:


we have a possible sequence now:
but cola must also come before water which is before tea isn't correct it has to be on the left of tea, so lets re order again
since fanta can only fit after cola but this leaves no space we try putting fanta in position 2


fanta - ? won't work unless it's right of cola 
but clue one states that sprite is left of water (this still holds true), as does clue seven where tea must be to the left of water, however from clues 5 and 6 cola can only be on the left if this order exists:


tea has to come after milk so lets put them in order then try other conditions such that cola meets being left of fanta which also is left of water
since we know tea comes before sprite (before water) why not try putting tea at position 3


this leaves no room for fanta or cola hence lets re look again and start from the beginning, with cola to the right:


cola can only be on the right if its after the sequence milk - tea hence a new sequence emerges: 
but we already decided that sprite has to come before water and tea also comes before this so lets re arrange but meet these conditions


a clue exists for fanta being left of cola but in reverse (cola is left of fanta) as well as having it after another item so we'll try with the sequence that gives room:
lets re look at our clues: milk - tea and cola - fanta, we know sprite comes before water hence this gives us:


milk - ? won't work unless its right of milk then we meet other conditions 
tea has to come before sprite which also is before water (after) so lets put them in order that allows for cola and fanta to fit


the only remaining option is thus:


fanta can only be on the right as long as it's after cola but still not meeting other conditions such that tea comes before sprite 
since cola must come before fanta which also is left of water we have:
so lets try cola being at position one (no, doesn't meet conditions), then at 2: milk - ? won't work hence re order so cola meets the requirements:


a clue exists for water having to be right of tea and after cola which has to come before fanta hence:


this still leaves no room unless we have this final sequence:


tea comes before sprite (before water) so lets put them in that order that allows cola and fanta to also fit meeting all conditions:


milk - ? won't work unless it's followed by tea hence:
lets re look at our clues: milk - tea, then the cola and fanta 
cola can only be left of fanta if we have this sequence:


we finally get a result meeting all conditions with this final sequence:


cola has to come before fanta which also is left of water (right) so lets put these in order that meets other requirements such as milk - tea sprite:


tea comes after milk hence:
lets re arrange but meet these conditions, the person drinking cola is somewhere to the left of the person drinking fanta##5


so we have a possible sequence now:
but this still leaves no room for cola being on the left if water isn't also before it so lets try another sequence such that cola comes first then meets other requirements:


the only remaining option is thus:


cola can only fit in position 1 or higher hence why not try putting it at the start but meeting all conditions 
tea has to come after milk hence:
we know tea - sprite must exist, as well as having cola before fanta which also is left of water


so lets try putting them in that order that allows for these items and still meets other requirements
milk - ? won't work unless it's followed by another item so we have a possible sequence now:


the only remaining option is thus:

since we know milk comes first, then the sequence of tea and sprite, as well as having cola - fanta meeting all conditions:


milk - ? won't work unless it's followed by another item hence why not try putting these items in order that meets other requirements
tea has to come after milk so lets put them in order that meets other requirements


a clue exists for water having to be right of tea, and after cola which has to come before fanta
the only remaining option is thus:


since we know tea - sprite must exist, as well as having cola before fanta which also is left of water
fanta can only fit if its right of cola (after) hence why not try putting it at position 5 or higher


we finally get a result meeting all conditions with this final sequence:
tea comes before sprite (before water) so lets put them in that order that allows cola and fanta to also fit
milk - ? won't work unless it's followed by another item hence why not try putting these items in order


since fanta can only fit right of cola which also must be after milk, tea but still left of water so lets put them in that order
the person drinking sprite being left of the one who drinks water

Lv5-1x6-8	"Let's analyze the clues step by step:


From clue 1, we know that the person eating potato is indeed eating potato.


From clue 5, we know that the person eating potato is to the left of the person eating peach.


From clue 2, we know that the person eating peach is to the right of the person eating lettuce.


From clue 6, we know that the person eating potato is to the left of the person eating lettuce. Combining this with clues 5 and 2, we get:


Potato -> Lettuce -> Peach


From clue 3, we know that the person eating broccoli is to the right of the person eating peach.


So far, we have:


Potato -> Lettuce -> Peach -> Broccoli


From clue 4, we know that the person eating cucumber is to the left of the person eating onion.


From clue 7, we know that the person eating cucumber is to the right of the person eating broccoli. Combining this with clue 4, we get:


Broccoli -> Cucumber -> Onion


Combining all the information, we get the final solution:

Lv5-1x6-9	"#|            |      1      |   2   |    3    |   4   |  5   |   6    |

|#            | Almond-milk | Water | Mirinda | Fanta | Milk | Coffee |

The explanation for the solution is as follows:

From statement 2, we know that water is between mirinda and almond-milk. Since almond-milk is on the left of water (statement 4), the order is: almond-milk -> water -> mirinda.

Statement 5 tells us that mirinda is to the left of fanta, so the updated order is: almond-milk -> water -> mirinda -> fanta.

From statement 1, we know coffee is to the right of milk. Statement 3 says fanta is to the left of milk, and since fanta is already placed next to mirinda, the order becomes: almond-milk -> water -> mirinda -> fanta -> milk -> coffee.

Therefore, the final solution table is as shown above with the beverages in their correct positions from 1 to 6."
Lv5-1x6-10	"Based on the given clues, I will solve the puzzle and fill in the table.


From clue 1, we know that Thriller is to the left of Horror.

From clue 6, we also know that Horror is to the right of Thriller, which confirms the order: ...Thriller...Horror...

From clue 2, we know that Adventure is to the left of Spy.

From clue 4, we know that Family is to the right of Horror.

From clue 5, we know that Adventure is to the right of Family. Combining this with the previous information, we get: ...Thriller...Horror...Family...Adventure...

Now, using clue 3, we know that Documentary is next to Thriller. Since there's no space on the left of Thriller, Documentary must be on the right of Thriller.

Finally, Spy can only fit in the remaining spot.


Here is the final solution table:
