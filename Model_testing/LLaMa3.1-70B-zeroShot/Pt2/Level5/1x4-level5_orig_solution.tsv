Lv5-1x4-1	"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the right of the person driving the taxi.
This means Taxi cannot be in column 4, and Airplane cannot be in column 1.

2. The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the left of the person driving the ship.
This means Ship cannot be in column 1, and Airplane cannot be in column 4.

3. The person driving the airplane is between the person driving the taxi and the person driving the helicopter.
This means Taxi and Helicopter must be on either side of Airplane.

Considering all clues, we can deduce the following order:

Taxi - Airplane - Helicopter - Ship

So, the final solution table is:

Lv5-1x4-2	"Let's break down the clues:

From clue 2, we know that writing is to the right of filmmaking.

From clue 1, we know that rock-climbing is to the right of writing.

So far, we have: filmmaking, writing, rock-climbing (in some order)

From clue 4, we know that rock-climbing is to the right of reading.

Now we can combine all these clues:

* Rock-climbing must be on the far left or far right (clue 3). But since it's also to the right of reading, it can't be on the far left. So it must be on the far right.
* Reading is to the left of rock-climbing, and writing is to the left of rock-climbing as well. Since writing is also to the right of filmmaking, we have: filmmaking, writing, reading (in some order), then rock-climbing.

But since rock-climbing is on the far right, reading must be in position 3.

Now we can fill in the rest:

filmmaking, writing, reading, rock-climbing

Here's the completed table:


| Hobby   |    filmmaking   |     writing    |      reading    |   rock-climbing |
|         |       1        |       2        |        3        |       4        |

Lv5-1x4-3	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The dressmaker is on the right of the librarian.
2. The dressmaker is on the far left or far right.
3. This clue doesn't give us any new information, but it confirms that there is an architect.
4. The architect is somewhere to the right of the writer.

From clue 2, we know the dressmaker can only be in position 1 or 4.

If the dressmaker is in position 1, then the librarian must be on their left, which means the librarian is not present (since there's no one to the left of position 1). Therefore, the dressmaker cannot be in position 1. The dressmaker must be in position 4.

Now, using clue 1, we know the librarian is to the left of the dressmaker. Since the dressmaker is in position 4, the librarian can only be in position 3.

Using clue 4, we know the architect is somewhere to the right of the writer. However, since the dressmaker (and the librarian) are already placed, and there's no space for both the architect and the writer to the left of the librarian, the writer must be in position 1. The architect can only fit in position 2.

Here's the final solution:


#############
|       |   1    |     2     |     3     |     4      |
| Job   | Writer | Architect | Librarian | Dressmaker|

Lv5-1x4-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement given and apply them step by step.

1. **The person who's hobby is Sudoku is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.**
   
   This implies that Skydiving < Sudoku (in terms of position from left to right).

2. **The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games.**

   So, we have Video-Games < Skydiving.

3. **The person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is Sudoku.**

   This gives us Sudoku < Baking.

Combining all these inequalities:

- Video-Games < Skydiving (from statement 2)
- Skydiving < Sudoku (from statement 1, reversing for clarity)
- Sudoku < Baking (from statement 3)

So, the order from left to right is: **Video-Games**, **Skydiving**, **Sudoku**, **Baking**.

Here's the final solution table:


|         |      1      |     2     |   3    |   4    |
| Hobby   |             |           |        |        |

Lv5-1x4-5	"Based on the given clues, I'll solve the logic puzzle.


From clue 1: The person watching crime movies is between the person watching scientific movies and the person watching epic movies.

From clue 2: The person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person watching action movies.

From clue 3: The person watching scientific movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching epic movies.

Now, let's combine these clues:

* Epic movies can't be in position 4 (if it were, there would be no space for crime and scientific movies).
* Scientific movies must be between epic and action movies.
* Crime movies must be between scientific and epic movies.

Considering all possibilities, the final solution is:

Lv5-1x4-6	"After solving the logic puzzle, I arrived at the following solution:


|         |   1    |   2   |   3    |    4    |
| Hobby   |        |       |        |         |

becomes:


#############
|         |   1    |   2   |   3    |    4    |
| Hobby   | Baking | Chess | Sudoku | Writing |
#############

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

* From clue 1, chess is in an even position. This means it can only be in positions 2 or 4.
* From clue 2, writing is on the far left or far right. Since chess is already in one of the even positions, writing must be on the opposite end, which is position 4 (far right) or position 1 (far left).
* From clue 3, sudoku is to the right of chess.
* From clue 4, sudoku is also to the right of baking.

Let's analyze these clues together:
- Chess can only be in positions 2 or 4. If it were in position 4, sudoku would have nowhere to go (since it needs to be to the right of chess). So, chess must be in position 2.
- Sudoku must be to the right of chess, so sudoku goes in position 3.
- Baking can't be on the far left or far right (writing is already there), and it also can't be next to sudoku (since sudoku needs to be to the right of baking). So, baking goes in position 1.
- Writing takes the remaining spot on the far right, which is position 4.

The final solution table is:


#############
|         |   1    |   2   |   3    |    4    |
| Hobby   | Baking | Chess | Sudoku | Writing |

Lv5-1x4-7	"After analyzing the clues, I've arrived at a solution:


|               |   1    |   2    |    3    |    4     |
| Nationality   |        |        |         |          |

Final Solution:

|               |   1    |   2    |    3    |    4     |
| Nationality   | French | Indian | British | Nigerian |

Here's the reasoning:


From clue (1), we know the Indian is to the left of the British.


From clue (2), we know the French is to the left of the Nigerian.


Combining these two clues, we can deduce that the French must be in position 1 and the Nigerian must be in position 4, since they are the outermost nationalities.


Now, from clue (3), we know the British is between the French and the Nigerian. Since the French is already in position 1, the British must be either in position 2 or 3.


However, if the British were in position 2, it would contradict clue (1) which says the Indian is to the left of the British. Therefore, the Indian must be in position 2, and the British in position 3.


The final solution is:


#############
|               |   1    |   2    |    3    |    4     |

Lv5-1x4-8	"Let's analyze the clues:


From clue 2, we know the train is to the left of the boat.

From clue 3, we know the boat is in an odd position (1 or 3).

Considering clue 1, if the roller is on the left of the boat, then the boat must be in position 3 (since the roller can't be in position 4). If the roller is on the right of the boat, then the boat could be in either position 1 or 3.

Combining these observations, we can conclude that:


* The train is in position 1 or 2.
* The boat is in position 3 (since it's an odd position).
* The roller is on the left or right of the boat.


Now, from clue 4, we know the bike is to the left of the boat. Since the boat is in position 3, the bike must be in position 1 or 2.

The only remaining position is for the train. Since the bike is already occupying one of the first two positions, and the train is to the left of the boat (clue 2), the train must be in position 2.


So far, we have:


|             |  1   |   2   |  3   |   4    |
| Transport   | bike | train | boat |        |

The only remaining vehicle is the roller. Since it's on the left or right of the boat (clue 1), and position 4 is available, we can conclude that:


* The roller is in position 4.


Here is the final solution table:

From clue 3, we know that hiking is to the left of magic-tricks.

Combining these two clues, we get: Juice -> Water -> Iced-Tea (in that order)

Now, from clue 3, we know that Iced-Tea is between 7up and Water. Since we already established that Water is to the right of Juice, we can conclude that 7up must be to the left of Juice.
