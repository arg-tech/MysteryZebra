Lv5-2x2-1	"Based on the clues provided:


Since the dressmaker is somewhere to the left of the fan of dubstep, and there are only two columns, this means that the dressmaker must be in column 1.

The person in column 2 must prefer dubstep, since they are to the right of the dressmaker.


Here's a possible solution:


|               |     1      |    2     |
| Job           | Designer   | Dressmaker cannot be here, so...  | Dressmaker |
| Job Corrected  | Dressmaker|            designer              |
| Music-Genre   | Reggae     |          Dubstep                 |

Final corrected solution is:

#############

Lv5-2x2-2	"Based on the given information:


|             |    1     |     2     |

From clue 1, we know that the person driving the airplane is somewhere to the left of the owner of the goat.


This means the person driving the airplane cannot be in column 2. So, the person driving the airplane must be in column 1.


|             |    Airplane     |     Motorbike     |
| Pet         |          |           |
 
Since there are only two pets and the person with the goat is to the right of the airplane driver, the pet in column 1 cannot be a goat. It must be either a lizard or another animal not mentioned (but since we're told that there are only two pets - goat and lizard - this other option is impossible). So it's a lizard.


|             |    Airplane     |     Motorbike     |
| Pet         | Lizard          |           |

The remaining pet must be the goat, which belongs to the person in column 2. This person uses a motorbike for transport.


|             |    Airplane     |     Motorbike     |
| Pet         | Lizard          | Goat            |
 
We now have the complete solution table:

Lv5-2x2-3	"Let's analyze the puzzle:

From clue 1, we know that the fan of R&B is to the right of the person using the boat.

We can start by placing the music genres in the order: Rock (left) and R&B (right).

Now, let's consider the transport options. We know that one person uses a boat and the other person uses a subway.

Since the fan of R&B is to the right of the person driving the boat, we can conclude that:

* The person using the boat must be on the left.
* The person using the subway must be on the right (since there's only two options).

Here's the final solution table:


|               |  1   |   2    |
| Music-Genre   | Rock | R&B    |
| Transport     | Boat | Subway |

Lv5-2x2-4	"Let's analyze the clues:


1. The fan of gospel is somewhere to the right of the person watching musical movies.

This means that the person who likes musical movies must be in column 1, and the person who likes gospel music must be in column 2.


Since there are only two movie-genres (musical and zombie) and two music-genres (classical and gospel), we can start filling in the table:


|               |     1     |   2    |
| Movie-Genre   | Musical  | Zombie |
| Music-Genre   | Classical| Gospel |

 Wait, this is the only possible solution!


So, the final answer is:


#############
|               |     1     |   2    |
| Movie-Genre   | Musical  | Zombie |
| Music-Genre   | Classical| Gospel |

Lv5-2x2-5	"Let's analyze the clue:

""The German is somewhere to the right of the person driving the ship""

This means that the person driving the ship cannot be German, so they must be Mexican. Also, since the German is to the right of the person driving the ship, the German must be in column 2.

Here's the updated table:


|               |    1    |   2    |
| Nationality   | Mexican | German |
| Transport     |         |        |

Now, let's consider the remaining options. The Mexican is driving something, but it can't be the ship (since that would contradict the clue). So, the Mexican must be driving the bus.

Here's the final table:


|               |    1    |   2    |
| Nationality   | Mexican | German |
| Transport     | Bus      | Ship   |

And here is the solution with '#############' around it:


#############
|               |    1    |   2    |
| Nationality   | Mexican | German |

Lv5-2x2-6	"Let's analyze the puzzle:


We know there are two favourite beverages: almond-milk and milk.


We also know there are two jobs: pilot and project-manager.


The only clue we have is that ""the person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the right of the pilot.""


This means the pilot cannot be on the right, so the pilot must be in column 1.


Now, let's fill in the table:


|            |   1   |        2        |
| Beverage   |       |                 |
| Job        | Pilot | Project-Manager |

The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the right of the pilot, so it must be the project-manager who drinks almond-milk.


This means the person in column 1 (the pilot) must drink milk.


Here's the final solution table:


#############
|            |   1   |        2        |
| Beverage   | Milk  | Almond-Milk     |
| Job        | Pilot | Project-Manager |

Lv5-2x2-7	"Based on the given information, here's the step-by-step logic:

* From statement 1: ""The person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the person watching romance movies.""
This means that if we consider the two columns from left to right, tea must come before the person watching romance.

Here are a few initial possibilities (keeping in mind there are only two beverages and two genres):

- If tea were associated with column 2, it would violate the rule since nothing could be to its left. So, tea cannot be in column 2.
- This means tea is in column 1.

Given tea's position, let's consider romance's position:

- Since romance must come after (to the right of) tea according to statement 1, and considering there are only two columns, this implies that romance can only be in column 2. 

Now, we have the following so far:

|               |   1   |    2     |
| Beverage      | Tea   |          |
| Movie-Genre   |       | Romance |

Finally, let's fill in the remaining blanks with what we haven't used yet (iced-tea and crime):

|               |   1   |    2     |
| Beverage      | Tea   | Iced-Tea |
| Movie-Genre   | Crime | Romance |

Thus, the final solution table is:


#############
|               |   1   |    2     |
| Beverage      | Tea   | Iced-Tea |
| Movie-Genre   | Crime | Romance |

Lv5-2x2-8	"Let's break down the clues:

* The person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the left of the fan of techno.

From this clue, we can infer that the person drinking lemonade cannot be in column 2, since there is no one to their right. Therefore, the person drinking lemonade must be in column 1.

Here's a possible solution:


|               |    1     |   2    |
| Beverage      | lemonade | 7up    |
| Music-Genre   | trance    | techno |

However, this is not the only possible solution. We can also swap the music genres:

|               |    1     |   2    |
| Beverage      | lemonade | 7up    |
| Music-Genre   | techno    | trance |

But wait! The clue says that the person drinking lemonade is to the left of the fan of techno. This means that the first solution we proposed cannot be correct, since the person drinking lemonade and the fan of techno are in different columns.

Therefore, the only possible solution is:


#############
|               |    1     |   2    |
| Beverage      | lemonade | 7up    |
| Music-Genre   | techno    | trance |

Lv5-2x2-9	"Based on the puzzle statement:


Since the person drinking soy-milk is to the right of the owner of the fish, it means that the owner of the fish must be in column 1 and the person drinking soy-milk must be in column 2.


Here's a possible solution:


|            |   1   |    2     |

From clue 1, we know that the bus driver is to the left of the bike driver.


From clue 2, we know that the country music fan is to the right of the disco music fan.

* The bike driver must be in column 2 (to the right).
* The disco music fan must be in column 1 (to the left).
* The country music fan must be in column 2 (to the right).
