Lv5-3x3-1	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a solution. Here's the completed table:


|         |    1    |      2       |      3       |
| Hobby   | Board-games| Singing     | Chess        |
| Job     | Photographer| Writer     | Freelancer  |
| Sport   | Snowboarding| Soccer     | Baseball     |

 

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 2, we know that the person who likes snowboarding also likes board-games. So, the ""Board-games"" hobby is paired with ""Snowboarding"" sport.

From clue 4, we know that the person who likes singing also likes soccer. So, the ""Singing"" hobby is paired with ""Soccer"" sport.

Now, let's analyze the job column. From clue 1, we know that the freelancer is to the right of the writer. This means the order of jobs is: Writer, Freelancer (since it can't be on the leftmost side).

From clue 3, we know that the freelancer is between the person who likes baseball and soccer. Since soccer is paired with singing, baseball must be paired with either board-games or chess.

But from clue 5, we know that baseball is to the right of board-games. This means that board-games can't be paired with baseball (since it would violate clue 5). So, board-games is paired with snowboarding (as already established), and baseball must be on the rightmost side.

The only job left for the person who likes board-games (and snowboarding) is Photographer. The writer must be in the middle column to satisfy clue 1.

Therefore, the completed table is:


|         |    1    |      2       |      3       |
| Hobby   | Board-games| Singing     | Chess        |

Lv5-3x3-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:


From clue 2, we know that blues is to the right of disco.


From clue 4, we know that rock-climbing is in an even position, so it must be either 2 or not possible since there are only three columns, but then it has to be the second column.


From clue 1, we know that hot-chocolate is to the right of trance. Since trance can't be in the third column (because then hot-chocolate would be out of bounds), trance must be in either the first or second column. But if trance were in the second column, it would conflict with rock-climbing being in the second column. So, trance must be in the first column.


From clue 1 again, we know that hot-chocolate is to the right of trance. Therefore, hot-chocolate must be in either the second or third column. But since disco is on the left or right of hot-chocolate (clue 5), and blues is to the right of disco (clue 2), hot-chocolate can't be in the second column (because then there wouldn't be enough space for both disco and blues). So, hot-chocolate must be in the third column.


Now we know the order for music-genre: trance - ? - hot-chocolate


From clue 5 again, we know that disco is on the left or right of hot-chocolate. Since hot-chocolate is in the third column, disco must be in either the second or not possible since there isn't a fourth column but then it would have to be to the left so it has to be the second column and that leaves only one space for blues which also can't be in column 3.


So now we know the order for music-genre: trance - disco - hot-chocolate


And the remaining music-genre, blues, must be in column 1, no it can't. We already have trance there so then it has to be on the right of disco which also conflicts with clue number one. So this whole logic was wrong and we need to restart.


So let's restart:


From clue 2, we know that blues is to the right of disco.


From clue 4, we know that rock-climbing is in an even position, so it must be either 2 


Now since rock climbing has a hobby of puzzles for its left neighbor or water for its right neighbor from clues 3 and 5 respectively then that person can't have trance as the favorite music-genre because that conflicts with clue number one. Then we already know who prefers disco - the same person who likes collecting, but where is this person located? This person must be either in column 1 or else there isn't enough space for blues to the right of him and hot-chocolate also to the right of trance but then if he were on the left side that conflicts with clue number three which says water has to be to the right of puzzles.


So this is also wrong


Let's start all over again:


From clue 2, we know that blues is to the right of disco.


From clue 4, we know that rock-climbing is in an even position, so it must be either 2 


Now from clues 1 and 5 we get that hot-chocolate has trance on its left and disco on one of its sides. We also get that water has puzzles to its left from clue number three


Then the person drinking water can't have rock climbing as a hobby because this conflicts with clue four so then we have collecting - water - something (but what beverage could he be drinking if not hot-chocolate or water? only one possibility remains) and we also have that trance is on the left side and blues on the right side of the table but where do they fit in? And what hobbies does the person who likes trance have and the one that likes blues? Since rock-climbing isn't an option for either of them because then we'd have two people with the same hobby and we don't, it has to be puzzles - trance (can't conflict with clue 3 now) or collecting - trance can't work since from clue 5 we get that hot-chocolate is next to disco but what if we put collecting on the rightmost column? Then we'd have water in the middle, and this conflicts with clue number three. So only one option remains


So after all these restarts here's the final table:

Lv5-3x3-3	"Let's break down the clues step by step:


From clue 1, we know the person eating plum is the journalist.


From clue 2, we know the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is chess.


From clue 3, we know the person who's hobby is chess is between the person who's hobby is woodworking and the freelancer. Since there are only three columns, this means the person with the chess hobby must be in column 2.


From clue 4, we know the person eating radish is the person who's hobby is chess. So, the person in column 2 eats radish and has chess as their hobby.


From clue 5, we know the journalist is somewhere to the left of the freelancer. Since the person in column 1 or 2 could be the journalist (from clue 1), this means the journalist must be in column 1.


Now let's fill in the table:

Lv5-3x3-4	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |  1   |  2   |     3     |
| Food          | plum | soul | artichoke |
| Music-Genre   | techno| punk | soul      |
| Transport     | taxi | bus  | jet-ski   |


Here's my reasoning:

From clue 4, we know the person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the person driving the taxi. This means the taxi driver must be in position 1 or 2.

From clue 2, we know the person eating artichoke drives a jet-ski. Combining this with clue 4, we can conclude that the artichoke-eater (and jet-ski driver) is in position 3.

From clue 5, we know the fan of punk is to the left of the person eating artichoke. Since the artichoke-eater is in position 3, the fan of punk must be in position 2.

Now, let's look at clue 1: ""The fan of soul is between the person eating plum and the person eating artichoke."" We already know the artichoke-eater is in position 3. If the fan of soul were in position 1, there would be no one to their right (to satisfy the condition). Therefore, the fan of soul must be in position 2, but we've already placed the punk fan there! This means the plum-eater must be in position 1.

Finally, from clue 3, we know the fan of techno is on the far left or far right. Since position 3 is taken by the artichoke-eater (and jet-ski driver), and position 2 is taken by the punk fan, the techno fan must be in position 1.

Lv5-3x3-5	"After solving the puzzle, I got the following result:

#############


Explanation:

* From statement 5, we know the coach is watching western movies.
* From statement 2, we know the freelancer is on the far right (column 3).
* From statement 1, we know the coach cannot be on the far right or left, so it must be in column 2.
* From statement 4 and 3, we can conclude that the order of sports from left to right is: soccer, surfing, snowboarding. So, the person who likes surfing (column 2) is already taken by the coach watching western movies, hence the surfing sport must be with the coach (which is not possible since it has to be somewhere to the left of the satire movie-watcher). This means that column 1 should have soccer and column 2 should have surfing. However this contradicts our previous assumption about the coach's position. Hence we change the assumption: column 1 should have the satire movie-watcher, hence it will be security-guard.
* From statement 5, we know the coach is watching western movies and from above we already placed the coach in column 2.

Lv5-3x3-6	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |     1     |     2      |     3      |
| Job           | Dressmaker | Manager    | Paramedic   |
| Nationality   | Thai       | French     | Mexican     |
| Transport     | Tram       | Trike      | Snowmobile  |

Here's how I deduced the solution:

* From clue 4, we know that the dressmaker is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. This means that the dressmaker must be in column 1 or 2.
* From clue 5, we know that the person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the right of the dressmaker, which confirms that the dressmaker is in column 1.
* From clue 3, we know that the person driving the trike is... well, this doesn't give us much information, but it does confirm that there is a person driving a trike!
* From clue 2, we know that the Thai is between the manager and the French. Since the French is on the left of the person driving the trike (clue 1), the French must be in column 3 or 2, and the Thai must be in column 1 or 2.
* Combining these clues, we can conclude that the Thai is in column 1 (since they're between the manager and the French, and the dressmaker is already in column 1). The French must then be in column 2, and the Mexican must be in column 3.
* Finally, from clue 1, we know that the French is on the left of the person driving the trike. This means that the person driving the trike must be in column 3, which leaves the tram for column 1 and the snowmobile for column 2 doesn't work (since the dressmaker is already there). So the paramedic drives the snowmobile.

Here's the final solution table:

Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 1, we know that Mirinda is either to the left or right of Cooking. Since there are only three positions, this means that Cooking must be in the middle (position 2).

Clue 2 tells us that Nigerian is somewhere to the right of Cooking. This means that Nigerian can't be in position 1, so it must be in either position 2 or 3.

From clue 3, we know that Tea is associated with Australian. Clue 4 states that Tea (Australian) is to the right of Nigerian. Therefore, Australian must be in position 3, and Nigerian must be in position 2.

Clue 5 tells us that Collecting is either to the left or right of Cooking. Since Cooking is in position 2, and we already have a beverage (Mirinda) associated with Cooking, Collecting must be in position 1.

Finally, Lemonade is the only remaining beverage, so it must go in position 1, making Chinese the corresponding nationality.

Lv5-3x3-9	"Let's analyze the clues:


From clue 5, we know the fan of folk is to the left of the owner of the snake.
From clue 2, we know the British is to the right of the fan of folk.

So, the order for these three is: folk -> British -> snake


Now, let's look at clue 4, which says the owner of the cat is Brazilian.


From clue 3, we know the owner of the cat (Brazilian) is to the right of the fan of folk.
Since the British is also to the right of the fan of folk, and the Brazilian is to the right of the British (because there's only one position left), we can conclude that:


The order for these four is: folk -> British -> snake doesn't work, because the Brazilian needs to be to the right of the British. So, it must be: folk -> ? -> British -> ?

From clue 1, we know the owner of the snake is to the left of the fan of ambient.

Lv5-3x3-10	"Let's start solving the puzzle step by step.


From clue 5, we know the Canadian is in an even position, which means they must be in either column 2 or none (since there are only 3 columns). However, from clue 4 and 7, we know the Russian is the fan of jazz, and from clue 1, the fan of jazz is in an odd position. Since the Canadian cannot be in an odd position, the Russian must be in column 1 or 3.


From clue 2, we know the Canadian is to the left of the person drinking Sprite. If the Canadian were in column 3 (the only even position available), there would be no one to their right who could be drinking Sprite. Therefore, the Canadian must be in column 2.


Now we can start filling in the table:


|               |     1     |    2     |    3    |
| Beverage      |           |          |         |

| Nationality   | Russian   | Canadian |         |

From clue 6, we know the Brazilian is drinking Fanta. Since there are only three nationalities and the Russian and Canadian are already assigned, the Brazilian must be in column 3.


|               |     1     |    2     |    3    |
| Beverage      |           |          | Fanta   |
| Music-Genre   |           |          |         |
| Nationality   | Russian   | Canadian | Brazilian|

From clue 4, we know the fan of jazz is the same as stated earlier (the Russian). Since the Russian is in column 1 and from clue 3, the fan of rock is to the left of the Canadian, it means the fan of rock must be in column 1.


|               |     1     |    2     |    3    |
| Beverage      |           |          | Fanta   |
| Music-Genre   | Rock/Jazz |          |         |
| Nationality   | Russian   | Canadian | Brazilian|

However, this is a contradiction since clue 1 states that the fan of jazz is in an odd position and there can't be two genres for one person. Let's re-examine our previous conclusions.


From clue 7, we know the Russian is the fan of jazz. From clue 1, the fan of jazz is in an odd position, which means they must be in either column 1 or 3. However, from clue 2 and 5, the Canadian is to the left of the person drinking Sprite and is in an even position (column 2), so the Russian cannot be in column 1 (as we initially concluded). This leaves us with only one option for the Russian: column 3.

| Beverage      |           |          |         |
| Music-Genre   |           |          | Jazz    |
| Nationality   |           | Canadian | Russian |

Now, using clue 6, the Brazilian is drinking Fanta. Since there are only three nationalities and two of them (Russian and Canadian) are already assigned to columns 2 and 3, the Brazilian must be in column 1.


|               |     1     |    2     |    3    |
| Beverage      |           |          |         |
| Music-Genre   |           |          | Jazz    |
| Nationality   | Brazilian | Canadian | Russian |

From clue 3, the fan of rock is to the left of the Canadian. Since the Canadian is in column 2 and the only position available to their left is column 1 (which is occupied by the Brazilian), it means the Brazilian must be a fan of rock.


|               |     1     |    2     |    3    |
| Beverage      |           |          |         |
| Music-Genre   | Rock      |          | Jazz    |
| Nationality   | Brazilian | Canadian | Russian |

Finally, using clue 2, the person drinking Sprite must be to the right of the Canadian. Since there are only three beverages (cola, fanta, sprite), and the Canadian cannot drink Fanta or else they would not be to the left of the person drinking it as per clue 6, we assign Cola to the Canadian.


|               |     1     |    2     |    3    |
| Beverage      |           | Cola     |         |
| Music-Genre   | Rock      |          | Jazz    |
| Nationality   | Brazilian | Canadian | Russian |

Since Sprite cannot be in column 2 (because the Canadian is to its left), it must be assigned to either column 1 or 3. However, since Fanta has been already assigned to someone (clue 6) and that someone is not in columns 1 and 2, we assign Fanta to the person whose music-genre is not yet defined which leaves only one position for Sprite: column 3.


|               |     1     |    2     |    3    |
| Beverage      | Sprite    | Cola     | Fanta   |
| Music-Genre   | Rock      |          | Jazz    |
| Nationality   | Brazilian | Canadian | Russian |

This also satisfies clue 6.


Now that we have all the information let's find out which music-genre is missing and assign it to its correct position. The only genre left is Blues. According to clue 2, it cannot be assigned to column 3 since it doesn't satisfy the criteria for being to the left of Sprite (it must be in an odd position because there are no more positions left). It can't be assigned to column 1 either as Rock has already been assigned. Hence, Blues should be assigned to column 2.
