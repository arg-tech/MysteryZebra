Lv5-1x3-1	"Based on the clues provided:


Since the person watching epic movies is on the far right, we can start by placing ""epic"" in column 3.


The second clue states that the person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching romance movies. This means ""superhero"" must be in either column 1 or 2.


Since there's no other information about the position of ""romance"", we can conclude that it must be in the remaining spot, which is column 2 if ""superhero"" is in column 1, or column 3 doesn't work because epic is already placed there and romance cannot be to the right of superhero.


So, we have two possibilities for the order: superhero-romance-epic or romance-superhero-epic (this second option contradicts clue number 2 so it can be ignored).


Therefore, the correct table with the final solution is:


#############
|               |     1     |    2    |  3   |
| Movie-Genre   | superhero | romance | epic |

Lv5-1x3-2	"Let's analyze the clues:


From clue 2, we know the fan of blues is to the right of the fan of soul.
This means the order is: Soul, Blues, ? (or just Soul, ?, Blues)

From clue 1, we know the fan of rock is to the right of the fan of blues.

Combining both clues, we get:


Soul | Blues | Rock


Here is the final solution table:

Lv5-1x3-3	"Let's analyze the clues:


Clue 1: The person eating grapes is on the right of the person eating broccoli.
This means Broccoli must be in position 1, and Grapes must be in either position 2 or 3.

Clue 2: The person eating raspberry is somewhere to the right of the person eating grapes.
Since Grapes can only be in position 2 (because if it were in position 3, there would be no space for Raspberry), this means Grapes must be in position 2, and Raspberry must be in position 3.


So, the solution table is:


|        |    1     |   2    |     3     |
| Food   | Broccoli | Grapes | Raspberry |

Lv5-1x3-4	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step:


From statement 1, we know that the person watching thriller movies is to the left of the person watching scientific movies.

This means the order is: Thriller - Scientific


From statement 2, we know that the person watching scientific movies is to the left of the person watching sports movies.


So, combining both statements, we get:


Thriller - Scientific - Sports


Here's the final solution table with '#############' around it:

Lv5-1x3-5	"Based on the given clues, I will fill in the table as follows:


|        |     1      |   2    |   3    |
| Food   |  watermelon | banana | carrot |

Here's my reasoning:

* Clue 1 states that the person eating watermelon is to the left of the person eating carrot. This means watermelon must be in either position 1 or 2.
* Clue 2 states that the person eating banana is between the person eating watermelon and the person eating carrot. Since banana must be between watermelon and carrot, and we know from clue 1 that watermelon is to the left of carrot, it means watermelon must be in position 1, and banana must be in position 2.
* Carrot, being on the right side of both watermelon and banana, must be in position 3.

Here is the final solution table:


#############
|        |     1      |   2    |   3    |

Lv5-1x3-6	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person drinking tea is on the left or right of the person drinking milk.
This means that tea and milk cannot be in the middle column.

2. The person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the person drinking milk.
This implies that tea must be either in column 1 or 2, but not in column 3 (since it's to the left of milk).

3. The person drinking milk is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking tea.
This means that milk cannot be on the edges (columns 1 or 3), since there needs to be a beverage on either side.

Combining these clues, we get:

|            |  1  |  2   |   3   |
| Beverage   |     |      |       |

The only possible arrangement is:
 Juice - Milk - Tea (since tea must be to the left of milk and milk needs to be between juice and tea)

The final solution table is:


|            |  1  |  2   |   3   |
| Beverage   |Juice|Milk |Tea    |

We can deduce that:

Apple must be in position 1, since it's to the left of Raspberry.
Raspberry must be in position 2, since Apple is to its left and Asparagus is to its right.
Asparagus must be in position 3, since it's to the right of Raspberry.
