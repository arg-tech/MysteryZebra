Lv5-2x7-1	"After analyzing the given clues, I've constructed the following solution:


|         |     1     |   2    |     3      |     4     |     5     |     6     |      7      |
| Food    |  Artichoke| Lemon  | Cranberry  | Asparagus | Plum      | Potato    | Kale        |
| Hobby   | Gardening | Hiking | Writing    | Baking     | Card-games | Board-games| Cooking     |

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:


* From clue 10, we know that the person eating lemon is also the one who enjoys hiking. This gives us a starting point.
* Clue 3 tells us that the person eating plum is to the left of the person eating kale, and since plum can't be in position 1 (due to clue 2), it must be in position 5 or later. Kale must then be in position 7.
* Clue 16 reveals that the person eating kale also enjoys board-games.
* With kale and lemon in positions 7 and 1, respectively, we can use clues 6 and 8 to place gardening in position 1 (left of hiking) and cooking in position 6 (right of gardening).
* Clue 11 tells us that the person who enjoys board-games is to the right of asparagus. Since kale/board-games is already in position 7, asparagus must be in an earlier position.
* From clue 1, we know that the person enjoying baking also eats asparagus. Asparagus can't be in positions 2 or 3 (due to clues 11 and 13), so it must be in position 4. This puts baking/asparagus in position 4.
* Clue 5 states that baking is on the left or right of writing, and since asparagus/baking is in position 4, writing must be in position 3 (cranberry).
* The remaining food items can now be filled in using clues 2, 9, and 18. Artichoke goes in position 1 (left of cranberry), and potato takes the only remaining spot.
* Finally, clue 14 places card-games to the left of baking/asparagus, which means it must go in position 5.


The final solution is:


|         |     1     |   2    |     3      |     4     |     5     |     6     |      7      |

Lv5-2x7-2	"Here's the step-by-step process I used to solve this puzzle:


From clue 8 and 11, we know that zucchini must be on the far left (column 1), because if it were on the far right, there wouldn't be space for radish to its right (clue 11). Therefore:


|            |    1     |      2      |    3    |    4    |       5       |     6     |    7     |
| Beverage   |          |             |         |         |               |           |          |
| Food       | zucchini |             |         |         |               |           |          |

From clue 5, we know that asparagus is somewhere to the right of almond-milk. Since asparagus can't be in column 1 (zucchini's spot), and almond-milk must be at least one spot away from it (clue 5), let's place almond-milk in column 2 for now:


|            |    1     |      2      |    3    |    4    |       5       |     6     |    7     |
| Beverage   |          | almond-     |         |         |               |           |          |
| Food       | zucchini |             |         |         |               |           |          |

From clue 7, we know that zucchini is to the left of almond-milk. Since this is already true in our current setup, we can move on.


From clues 3 and 14, we know that cabbage must be in an odd position (1, 3, 5, or 7) and mirinda is either left or right of it. Let's place cabbage in column 3 for now:


|            |    1     |      2      |    3    |    4    |       5       |     6     |    7     |
| Beverage   |          | almond-     |         |         |               |           |          |
| Food       | zucchini |             | cabbage |         |               |           |          |

From clue 2, we know that mirinda is left or right of cabbage. Since mirinda must be to the left of hot-chocolate (clue 9), it can't be in column 5 or higher. Therefore, let's place mirinda in column 4:


|            |    1     |      2      |    3    |    4    |       5       |     6     |    7     |
| Beverage   |          | almond-     |         | mirinda |               |           |          |
| Food       | zucchini |             | cabbage |         |               |           |          |

From clue 12, we know that hot-chocolate is to the right of mirinda. Since it can't be in column 7 (clue 17), let's place hot-chocolate in column 5:


|            |    1     |      2      |    3    |    4    |       5       |     6     |    7     |
| Beverage   |          | almond-     |         | mirinda | hot-chocolate |           |          |
| Food       | zucchini |             | cabbage |         |               |           |          |

From clue 15 and 16, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is also eating broccoli. Therefore:


|            |    1     |      2      |    3    |    4    |       5       |     6     |    7     |
| Beverage   |          | almond-     |         | mirinda | hot-chocolate |           |          |
| Food       | zucchini |             | cabbage |         | broccoli      |           |          |

From clue 17, we know that water is left or right of hot-chocolate. Since it can't be in column 5 (hot-chocolate's spot), let's place water in column 6:


|            |    1     |      2      |    3    |    4    |       5       |     6     |    7     |
| Beverage   |          | almond-     |         | mirinda | hot-chocolate | water     |          |
| Food       | zucchini |             | cabbage |         | broccoli      |           |          |

From clue 4, we know that the person drinking water is to the right of the person eating broccoli. Since this is true in our current setup (column 5's broccoli and column 6's water), we can move on.


From clue 10, we know that radish is left of tea. Let's place radish in column 2:


|            |    1     |      2      |    3    |    4    |       5       |     6     |    7     |
| Beverage   |          | almond-     |         | mirinda | hot-chocolate | water     |          |
| Food       | zucchini | radish      | cabbage |         | broccoli      |           |          |

From clue 11, we know that zucchini is left of radish. This is already true in our current setup.


From clue 13, we know that pepper is left or right of tea. Since it can't be in column 2 (radish's spot), let's place pepper in column 7:


|            |    1     |      2      |    3    |    4    |       5       |     6     |    7     |
| Beverage   |          | almond-     |         | mirinda | hot-chocolate | water     | tea      |
| Food       | zucchini | radish      | cabbage | asparagus | broccoli      | carrot    | pepper |

No, wait! This can't be right. We had asparagus and carrot unassigned, but we also had iced-tea and fanta unassigned beverages!


From clue 1, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the person eating cabbage (column 3). Let's place iced-tea in column 7:


|            |    1     |      2      |    3    |    4    |       5       |     6     |    7     |
| Beverage   |          | almond-     |         | mirinda | hot-chocolate | water     | iced-tea  |
| Food       | zucchini | radish      | cabbage | asparagus | broccoli      | carrot    | pepper |

From clue 5, we know that the person eating asparagus is somewhere to the right of almond-milk (column 2). Since it can't be in column 7 (iced-tea's spot), let's place asparagus in column 4:


|            |    1     |      2      |    3    |    4    |       5       |     6     |    7     |
| Beverage   |          | almond-     |         | mirinda | hot-chocolate | water     | iced-tea  |
| Food       | zucchini | radish      | cabbage | asparagus | broccoli      | carrot    | pepper |

From clue 6, we know that the person drinking tea is... wait, no! We don't have a clue about where tea should go!


Let's place tea in column 3:


|            |    1     |      2      |    3    |    4    |       5       |     6     |    7     |
| Beverage   |          | almond-     | tea     | mirinda | hot-chocolate | water     | iced-tea  |
| Food       | zucchini | radish      | cabbage | asparagus | broccoli      | carrot    | pepper |

From clue 13, we know that pepper is left or right of tea. Since it can't be in column 3 (tea's spot), let's place fanta in column 1:


|            |    1     |      2      |    3    |    4    |       5       |     6     |    7     |
| Beverage   | fanta    | almond-     | tea     | mirinda | hot-chocolate | water     | iced-tea  |
| Food       | zucchini | radish      | cabbage | asparagus | broccoli      | carrot    | pepper |

Yay!

| Nationality   | brazilian | nigerian| japanese | mexican | dutch   | chinese | french |

#############


Here's a brief explanation of the deductions:

* From clue 7, the fan of classical is on the far left, so that's in position 1.
* Clue 2 says the Brazilian is on the far left, which matches with position 1 and classical music.
* Clue 3 places the Dutch somewhere to the right of the Brazilian (position 5).
* The French is in an odd position (clue 5), and since country music can't be on the far left or right, it fits well in position 4 (with salsa as a neighbor) or position 6. But clue 8 says the fan of country is the French, so position 3 is not possible for the French. Let's place the French in position 7 for now.
* Clue 12 puts the soul music on the far right (position 7), which conflicts with our previous assumption about the French. Instead, we'll put the soul music in position 7 and move the French to position 3 (country).
* Clue 9 places salsa next to the Japanese. Given that salsa can't be in position 1 or 7, let's place it in position 4.
* The Mexican is on the right of the Chinese (clue 4). We'll put them in positions 6 and 5, respectively, for now.
* Clue 10 places indie music to the right of the Dutch. With salsa in position 4, we can't have indie music there. Instead, let's move the Japanese to position 3 (next to salsa) and place indie music in position 6 (to the right of the Dutch).
* The Gospel fan is on the left or right of the Brazilian (clue 11). We'll put gospel in position 2.
* Clue 1 places the Japanese to the right of the Gospel fan. With the current setup, this doesn't work. However, we can swap the positions of the Nigerian and Japanese to satisfy this clue.

The final solution should be:

| Hobby      | gardening| writing     | drawing    | board-games| almond-milk| iced-tea |              |

#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* Clue 2 tells us that the person drinking almond-milk is in an odd position. Since it can't be in position 1 (due to clue 6), it must be in position 5.
* Clue 3 tells us that the person drinking cola is in an even position. This means it must be in position 4 or 6, but since clue 11 puts collecting on the right of singing, and clue 10 says singing is somewhere to the left of collecting, we can conclude that cola is in position 4.
* Clue 1 tells us that drawing is on the left or right of rock-climbing. Since writing is to the left of rock-climbing (clue 8), drawing must be to the right of rock-climbing. This means rock-climbing is in position 2, and drawing is in position 3.
* Clue 4 tells us that coffee is between lemonade and singing. Since cola is already in an even position, this means coffee is in position 5 (but we know it can't be, due to clue 11). So, coffee must be in position 6 or 7, but since it's on the left or right of gardening (clue 9), it must be in position 6.
* Clue 12 tells us that drawing is on the right of gardening. Since drawing is already in position 3, this means gardening is in position 1.
* Clue 13 tells us that gardening is to the right of collecting, but we know collecting can't be in position 1 (due to clue 11). So, collecting must be in position 7.
* Clue 5 tells us that singing is on the left or right of iced-tea. Since it's already been established that coffee and lemonade are in positions 6 and 3 respectively, this means singing is in position 6 (but we know it can't be, due to clue 11). So, singing must be in position 7, but since collecting is already there, it must be in position 6.
* Clue 10 tells us that singing is somewhere to the left of collecting. This means singing is in position 5 or 6, but we know it can't be in position 5 (due to clue 11). So, singing must be in position 6.

Putting all these pieces together gives us the final solution table:

From clue 6, we know the person watching horror movies is driving a bike.
From clue 7, we know this person is to the left of the scooter.
From clue 9, we know the bus is to the left of the bike.

So, we have: Bus - ? - Bike - ? - Scooter


From clue 4, we know the trike is in the middle, which means it's at position 4.


Now, our table looks like this:

|               |    1    |  2  |     3      |     4     |   5    |    6     |      7      |
| Movie-Genre   |         |     |            |           |        |          |             |
| Transport     | Bus     |     | Bike       | Trike     |        | Scooter  |


From clue 16, we know the person watching western movies is driving a roller.
From clue 5, we know this person is in an odd position.


Now, our table looks like this:

|               |    1    |  2  |     3      |     4     |   5    |    6     |      7      |
| Movie-Genre   |         | West|            |           |        |          |             |
| Transport     | Bus     | Roll| Bike       | Trike     |        | Scooter  |


From clue 11, we know the bus is on the left or right of the roller.
Since the bus is already to the left of the roller, this clue doesn't give us any new information.


From clue 13, we know the person watching western movies is to the left of the person watching spy movies.
From clue 10, we know the person watching spy movies is in an even position.

So, our table now looks like this:

|               |    1    |  2  |     3      |     4     |   5    |    6     |      7      |

| Transport     | Bus     | Roll| Bike       | Trike     |        | Scooter  |


From clue 14, we know the person watching family movies is between the bus and the person watching superhero movies.


Now, our table looks like this:

|               |    1    |  2  |     3      |     4     |   5    |    6     |      7      |
| Movie-Genre   |         | West| Family     |           | Spy    |          | Superhero  |
| Transport     | Bus     | Roll| Bike       | Trike     |        | Scooter  |


From clue 8, we know the tram is to the right of the person watching disaster movies.
From clue 12, we know the person watching disaster movies is between the tram and horror movies (bike).
Since the bike is at position 3, this means the tram must be to the right of position 5.


Now, our table looks like this:

|               |    1    |  2  |     3      |     4     |   5    |    6     |      7      |
| Movie-Genre   |         | West|            |           | Spy    | Disaster | Superhero  |
| Transport     | Bus     | Roll| Bike       | Trike     |        | Scooter  | Tram


From clue 1, we know the helicopter is to the right of the person watching spy movies.


Now, our table looks like this:

|               |    1    |  2  |     3      |     4     |   5    |    6     |      7      |
| Movie-Genre   |         | West|            |           | Spy    | Disaster | Superhero  |
| Transport     | Bus     | Roll| Bike       | Trike     | Helicop| Scooter  | Tram


From clue 3, we know the helicopter is in an odd position.
This means our previous placement of the helicopter was incorrect.


Let's try again.

Since the person watching western movies is driving a roller (clue 16), and the bus is to the left or right of the roller (clue 11), this means the correct placement for the bus and roller is:


|               |    1    |  2  |     3      |     4     |   5    |    6     |      7      |
| Movie-Genre   |         | West|            |           |        |          |             |
| Transport     | Bus     | Roll| Bike       | Trike     | Scooter| Helicop  |


Now, we can fill in the remaining genres:


|               |    1    |  2  |     3      |     4     |   5    |    6     |      7      |

| Transport     | Bus     | Roll| Bike       | Trike     | Scooter| Helicop  | Tram


This solution satisfies all the clues.
