Here is the final solution table:

| Transport     | airplane    | roller   | jet-ski | car        | ship         |

#############

Explanation:

* The fan of blues is on the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski ( condition 1).
* The person watching thriller movies is on the left of the person drinking mirinda (condition 2).
* The person watching crime movies is the person driving the roller (condition 3).
* The fan of electronic is on the right of the person driving the car (condition 4).
* The person watching documentary movies is in an odd position (condition 5), so it's either in column 1, 3 or 5. Since condition 2 places thriller in column 1 and condition 8 says thriller is in an even position, documentary must be in column 3.
* The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies (condition 6).
* The person watching crime movies is somewhere to the left of the person drinking coffee (condition 9).
* The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the right of the fan of ambient (condition 10), and since condition 12 says roller is on the left of the fan of ambient, airplane must be in column 1.
* The person watching thriller movies is in an even position (condition 8), so it's either in column 2 or 4. Since condition 13 places milk to the right of thriller, and condition 14 says coffee is adventure, thrillers can't be in column 2, leaving column 4 as its only possible location.
* The person watching crime movies is on the right of the fan of country (condition 16).
* The fan of r&b is somewhere to the left of the person driving the jet-ski (condition 17).

Combining all these conditions and their consequences leads us to this final solution."	{'beverage': ['mirinda', 'coffee', 'milk', 'almond-milk', 'iced-tea'], 'movie-genre': ['thriller', 'adventure', 'crime', 'documentary', 'martial-arts'], 'music-genre': ['ambient', 'r&b', 'country', 'electronic', 'blues'], 'transport': ['airplane', 'roller', 'jet-ski', 'car', 'ship']}	True	2	False

Lv5-4x5-3	"I'll solve the puzzle step by step.


First, let's start with clue 10: ""the person watching epic movies is in an odd position"". This means that the person watching epic movies can be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

Next, let's look at clue 15: ""the person eating garlic is somewhere to the left of the person watching epic movies"". Since the person eating garlic is on the right of the person watching thriller movies (clue 1), we can conclude that the person watching epic movies must be in position 3 or 5.

Now, let's examine clue 6: ""the person who's sport is climbing is somewhere to the right of the owner of the frog"". We also know from clue 2 that ""the owner of the dog is on the left or right of the owner of the frog"". This suggests that the owner of the dog and the owner of the frog are adjacent, with the owner of the frog on the left.

From clue 11: ""the person watching action movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is climbing"", we can deduce that the person watching action movies must be in position 2 or 4, since the person who's sport is climbing is already constrained to be somewhere to the right of the owner of the frog.

Clue 7 states: ""the owner of the mouse is somewhere to the right of the person watching action movies"". This means that the owner of the mouse must be in position 3 or more likely 4, since we already have a constraint on position 5 from clue 10.


At this point, let's make an educated guess and try to place some of the other entities.

Since the person eating garlic is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is parkour (clue 14), and the person eating garlic is also on the left of the person watching epic movies (clue 15), we can try placing the person who's sport is parkour in position 1 or 2.

The owner of the goat must be somewhere to the left of the person watching zombie movies (clue 8). Since the person eating pineapple is on the left of the person watching zombie movies (clue 4), we can place the owner of the goat in position 1.


Here's a possible placement so far:


|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |    4     |     5      |
| Food          |            |             |           |          |            |
| Movie-Genre   |            |             |           |          |            |
| Pet           | Goat       | Dog/Frog    |           | Mouse    |            |
| Sport         | Parkour    |             | Climbing  |          | Epic-Sport |

Now, let's fill in the remaining gaps.


From clue 3: ""the person eating pear is on the right of the person watching zombie movies"", and since the owner of the goat is already placed to the left of the person watching zombie movies, we can conclude that the person watching zombie movies must be in position 2 or 3. However, we already have a constraint from clue 10 that the person watching epic movies is in an odd position, so it's more likely that the person watching zombie movies is in position 2.


From clue 13: ""the person eating grapes is on the right of the person eating pineapple"", and since the person eating pineapple is on the left of the person watching zombie movies (clue 4), we can place the person eating grapes in position 3 or more likely 4.


Clue 9 states: ""the person who's sport is rugby is on the right of the person eating orange"". This means that the person eating orange must be in position 1, but we already have a constraint from clue 12 that the owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the left of the owner of the goat. Therefore, we can place the person eating orange in position 2 or more likely 4.


At this point, let's summarize what we have so far:


|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |    4     |     5      |

| Sport         | Parkour    | Rugby       | Climbing  | Ice-Hockey| Soccer    |

Now, let's fill in the remaining gaps.


From clue 1: ""the person eating garlic is on the right of the person watching thriller movies"", we can place the person eating garlic in position 5.

Since the person eating pineapple is on the left of the person watching zombie movies (clue 4), and the owner of the goat is already placed to the left of the person watching zombie movies, we can conclude that the person eating pineapple must be in position 1.


From clue 14: ""the person eating garlic is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is parkour"", we can place the person eating grapes in position 3 or more likely 4.

Here's a possible placement:


|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |    4     |     5      |

| Sport         | Parkour    | Rugby       | Climbing  | Ice-Hockey| Soccer    |

Finally, let's fill in the remaining gaps.


From clue 5: ""the person who's sport is soccer is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing"", we can place the person who's sport is soccer in position 4 or more likely 2.


Since the owner of the chinchilla must be somewhere to the left of the owner of the goat (clue 12), and the owner of the goat is already placed in position 1, we can conclude that the owner of the chinchilla must be absent from the table. However, this contradicts our previous placement. Therefore, let's try swapping the positions of the person who's sport is soccer and the person who's sport is rugby.


Here's a possible placement:


|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |    4     |     5      |

| Sport         | Parkour    | Soccer      | Climbing  | Rugby    | Ice-Hockey |

And finally, let's fill in the remaining gaps.


From clue 8: ""the owner of the goat is somewhere to the left of the person watching zombie movies"", we can place the owner of the frog in position 2.


Here's a possible placement:


|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |    4     |     5      |

| Sport         | Parkour    | Soccer      | Climbing  | Rugby    | Ice-Hockey |

Here's the final answer:


|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |    4     |     5      |

| Transport     | bike    | bus      | roller  | van          | taxi      |

 
Let me explain how I solved it:

From clue 5, we know that gardening is to the right of the person driving the bus. From clue 11, we know that the roller is on the left of the taxi. From clue 2, we know that hip-hop is the taxi.

Combining these clues with others, we can start filling in the table:

* The fan of ambient is in an odd position (clue 4), and since there are only two remaining odd positions, it must be either 1 or 3. But if it were 3, salsa would have to be on the left of blues (clue 3), which doesn't work with other clues. So, ambient is in position 1.
* The person driving the bike is somewhere to the left of metal (clue 16). Since there's no room for bike and metal on the same side, bike must be either 1 or 2. But if it were 2, salsa would have to be on the right of blues (clue 3), which doesn't work with other clues. So, bike is in position 1.
* The owner of the hedgehog is the person driving the taxi (clue 15). Since hip-hop is the taxi (clue 2), and salsa is to the left of blues (clue 3), we can deduce that salsa is in position 2 and blues is in position 4.

Now, using clues 7, 8, and 9, we can determine the hobbies: drawing is between magic-tricks and gardening, singing is on the right of hedgehog, and lizard is on the right of singing. This puts reading in position 1.

Using clue 10, mouse must be to the left of bus, which means mouse is in position 1 (along with bike). Using clue 6, ferret is on the right of magic-tricks, so ferret must be either 3 or 5.

Finally, using clues 12 and 13, we can place metal and its owner. Since metal is to the right of mouse (clue 13), it must be in position 4. And since ferret is on the left or right of metal (clue 12), ferret must be in position 3.

Lv5-4x5-8	"Based on the given clues, I'll try to solve the puzzle. Here's my attempt:


|               |      1      |      2      |     3      |   4    |    5     |
| Beverage      | almond-milk | fanta       | tea        | coffee | water    |
| Food          | garlic      | cabbage     | avocado    | peach  | papaya   |
| Movie-Genre   | superhero   | documentary | drama      | crime  | sports   |
| Sport         | badminton   | biathlon     | -polo      | rugby  | tennis   |

Let me walk you through my thought process:

From clue 2, we know that the person watching documentary movies is drinking fanta. From clue 6, this person is also to the right of the person who's sport is badminton.

From clue 15, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person eating garlic. Since garlic can't be in position 1 (due to clue 8), almond-milk must be in position 1.

From clue 5, we know that the person drinking tea is eating avocado. From clue 14, this person is in an odd position, so it's either position 1 or 3. Since position 1 is already taken by almond-milk, tea and avocado are in position 3.

From clue 9, we know that the person watching crime movies is on the left or right of the person drinking tea (who is in position 3). From clue 13, this person is also to the right of the person watching superhero movies. Therefore, the person watching crime movies must be in position 4.

From clue 10, we know that the person watching drama movies is drinking water. From clue 12, this person is also to the left of the person drinking water (who can't be in position 1), so they must be in position 5.

Now we have:


|               |      1      |      2      |     3      |   4    |    5     |
| Beverage      | almond-milk | fanta       | tea        |        | water    |
| Food          | garlic      | cabbage     | avocado    |        | papaya   |
| Movie-Genre   | superhero   | documentary |            | crime  | drama    |
| Sport         | badminton   | biathlon     | -polo      | rugby  | tennis   |

From clue 1, we know that the person drinking coffee is to the right of the person who's sport is badminton. Therefore, coffee must be in position 4.

From clue 11, we know that the person who's sport is rugby is to the right of the person who's sport is water-polo (who can't be in position 1 or 2). From clue 3, the person eating cabbage is biathlon. Therefore, rugby must be in position 4.

From clue 4, we know that the person eating peach is on the right of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since water-polo can't be in position 1 or 2, peach must be in position 5.

From clue 16, we know that the person watching drama movies is to the right of the person watching documentary movies (who is in position 2). Since drama is already in position 5, this clue doesn't give us any new information.

Now we have:


|               |      1      |      2      |     3      |   4    |    5     |
| Beverage      | almond-milk | fanta       | tea        | coffee | water    |
| Food          | garlic      | cabbage     | avocado    | peach  | papaya   |
| Movie-Genre   | superhero   | documentary |            | crime  | drama    |
| Sport         | badminton   | biathlon     | -polo      | rugby  | tennis   |

Finally, we know that the person watching sports movies must be in position 3 (since it's the only remaining option), and the person eating papaya must be in position 5.

Here is the final solution:
