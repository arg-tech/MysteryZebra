1. Started by filling in the far-left and far-right columns based on clues 14, 20, and 36.
2. Used clue 5 to place lemonade somewhere to the left of golf (corn).
3. Filled in fanta (cat) and its neighbors using clues 3, 4, 7, and 9.
4. Determined the positions of western movies (right of documentary) and scientific movies using clues 23 and 30.
5. Placed fantasy movies (cycling) to the left of artichoke using clue 17.
6. Used clue 12 to place soccer on either side of artichoke, and then used other clues to narrow down its position.
7. Filled in soy-milk (drawing), coffee (gardening), and their neighbors using clues 16, 33, and 35.
8. Placed peach (ferret) between western movies and corn using clue 34.
9. Determined the positions of swimming (right of golf or western) using clues 25 and 32.

Here's a brief explanation of the deductions:


* Clue 26: The person watching western movies is the person driving the quad-bike, so they must be in position 1 or 6 (since the quad-bike is already given). Since clue 10 states that the person watching western movies is on the far left or far right, it must be position 1.
* Clue 28: The fan of house is on the far left or far right. Combining this with clue 15, we know the person eating banana (and a fan of house) is in position 2.
* Clue 25: The owner of the hamster is somewhere to the left of the person eating banana, so it must be in position 1 or not at all. However, since clue 27 states that the person driving the helicopter is the owner of the hamster, we can conclude that the helicopter is in position 2.
* Clue 10: The person watching western movies is on the far left or far right. We already know they are in position 1.
* Clue 22: The person watching western movies is somewhere to the left of the pakistani. This means the pakistani cannot be in position 1, so it must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
* Clue 6: The person watching disaster movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching zombie movies, which implies that the person watching zombie movies is not in position 6. Since clue 20 states that the person watching zombie movies is in an even position, it must be in position 2 or 4.
* Clue 13: The person watching epic movies is on the left of the person watching disaster movies. This implies that the person watching epic movies cannot be in position 6.
