Lv5-3x2-1	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 1, we know that the goldfish owner is on the right of the pony owner.

From clue 2, we know that the motorbike rider is somewhere to the right of the person eating peas.

Since there are only two columns, the motorbike rider must be in column 2. And since the motorbike rider is already assigned to column 2, the bike rider must be in column 1.

Now, let's fill in the food column. The person eating peas cannot be in column 2 (because of clue 2), so they must be in column 1. This means that the person eating plum must be in column 2.

Finally, we can assign the pets. Since the goldfish owner is on the right of the pony owner, and the pony owner cannot be in column 2 (because of clue 1), the pony owner must be in column 1. Therefore, the goldfish owner must be in column 2.

Here's the final solution table:


#############
|             |  1   |     2     |
| Food        | peas | plum    |
| Pet         | pony | goldfish|
| Transport   | bike | motorbike|

Lv5-3x2-2	"Based on the given clues, here is the step-by-step solution:


From clue 1: ""the person watching family movies is on the left of the person eating plum""
This means that the person watching family movies must be in column 2, and the person eating plum must be in column 1.


From clue 2: ""the indonesian is somewhere to the right of the japanese""
This means that the Indonesian must be in column 2, and the Japanese must be in column 1.


Now, let's fill in the table:


|               |     1     |      2       |
| Food          | plum      | raspberry    |
| Movie-Genre   | ?         | family       |
| Nationality   | japanese  | indonesian   |

Since there are only two movie genres (family and martial arts), and the person watching family movies is in column 2, the person in column 1 must be watching martial arts.


So, the final solution is:


#############
|               |     1     |      2       |
| Food          | plum      | raspberry    |

Lv5-3x2-3	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |    1     |         2          |
| Job           | Nurse    | Software-Developer|
| Movie-Genre   | Thriller | Family            |
| Sport         | Cricket  | Skateboarding     |
#############


Here's my reasoning:

* From clue 1, we know that the software-developer is the person watching family movies. So, column 2 must be the software-developer and their movie genre is ""Family"".
* Clue 2 states that the person who's sport is skateboarding is to the right of the person watching thriller movies. Since column 2 is already occupied by the software-developer (who watches family movies), the person who watches thriller movies must be in column 1.
* Now, we can fill in the rest of the table:
	+ Column 1: The nurse (since it's not the software-developer) watches thriller movies and their sport is cricket (since skateboarding is to the right).
	+ Column 2: The software-developer (as previously established) watches family movies and their sport is skateboarding.

I hope this solution is correct! Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns."	{'job': ['nurse', 'software-developer'], 'movie-genre': ['thriller', 'family'], 'sport': ['cricket', 'skateboarding']}	True	6	True
Lv5-3x2-4	"Let's break down the clues:


From clue 1, we know that the person who bakes (B) is to the left of the person who drinks water (W).


|               |     B     |       ?       |

| Music-Genre   |           |               |

From clue 2, we know that B is also to the left of the fan of electronic music (E). Since E can't be on the same side as W (from clue 1), E must be on the right.


|               |     B     |       ?       |
| Beverage      |           |               |
| Hobby         |           |               |
| Music-Genre   |           |        E       |

From clue 3, we know that W is either to the left or right of cola (C). Since C can't be on the same side as B (from clue 1), and W must be next to B, C must be on the right.


|               |     B     |       ?       |
| Beverage      |           |        C       |

| Music-Genre   |           |        E       |

Now we know that the person who drinks water (W) is next to B, so it must be on the left side.


|               |     B     |       W       |
| Beverage      |           |        C       |

| Music-Genre   |           |        E       |

The only hobby left for the person who drinks water is rock-climbing (R), and the only music-genre left for the person who bakes is classical (K).

Lv5-3x2-5	"After analyzing the given clues, I came up with a possible solution:


|               |     1      |    2     |
| Food          | grapefruit | broccoli|
| Hobby         | reading    | singing  |

This solution satisfies both conditions:

* The person eating grapefruit is to the left of the person watching epic movies (grapefruit is in column 1, and epic is in column 2)
* The person eating grapefruit is to the left of the person who's hobby is singing (grapefruit is in column 1, and singing is in column 2)

So, here is the final solution table:

Lv5-3x2-6	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|             |    1    |     2      |
| Hobby       | reading | cooking   |
| Pet         | mouse    | guinea-pig|
| Transport   | scooter  | train     |
#############


Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 1, we know that the owner of the mouse is to the left of the owner of the guinea-pig. This means that the person with the mouse must be in column 1.

From clue 2, we know that the person whose hobby is cooking is to the right of the person driving the scooter. Since there are only two columns, this means that the person with the scooter must be in column 1, and the person whose hobby is cooking must be in column 2.

Now, let's combine these insights:

* Column 1: mouse (because it's to the left of guinea-pig), scooter (because cooking is to its right)
* Column 2: guinea-pig (because it's to the right of mouse), train (because there's only one transport option left), cooking (because it's to the right of scooter)

The hobby for column 1 must be reading, since cooking is already assigned to column 2.

Therefore, the final solution is:

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 1, we know that the person watching comedy movies is to the left of the person whose hobby is baking. This means that in column 2, the movie genre must be western (since it can't be comedy), and the hobby must be baking.

From clue 2, we know that the Egyptian is to the left of the Polish person. Since the hobbies are already assigned to columns, this clue tells us that the nationality in column 1 must be Egyptian, and the nationality in column 2 must be Polish.

Finally, since the movie genre in column 2 is western, the only remaining movie genre (comedy) must go in column 1. Similarly, since the hobby in column 2 is baking, the only remaining hobby (puzzles) must go in column 1.

Therefore, the final solution table is as shown above."	{'hobby': ['puzzles', 'baking'], 'movie-genre': ['comedy', 'western'], 'nationality': ['egyptian', 'polish']}	True	6	True
Lv5-3x2-8	"Let's analyze the clues:


Clue 1: The person who's hobby is singing is the owner of the hedgehog.
This means that ""Singing"" and ""Hedgehog"" are in the same column.


Clue 2: The person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is rowing.
Since there are only two columns, this means that ""Cooking"" must be in the first column (1) and ""Rowing"" must be in the second column (2).


Now, let's fill in the table:


|         |     1      |    2     |
| Hobby   | Cooking    | Singing |
| Pet     |            | Hedgehog|
| Sport   |            | Rowing  |

We still need to figure out the remaining two cells.


Since ""Cooking"" is in column 1 and ""Singing"" is in column 2, we can deduce that:


* The pet in column 1 must be the one that's not a hedgehog, which is the pony.
* The sport in column 1 must be the one that's not rowing, which is water-polo.


So, here's the completed table:

Lv5-3x2-9	"Based on the given clues:


Since the Spanish person is to the left of the Pakistani (clue 2), and we have only two columns, the Spanish person must be in column 1.


The person who prefers surfing is to the left of the scientist (clue 1). Given that there are only two jobs and the Spanish person is already placed in column 1, the surfer must also be in column 1. If the surfer were in column 2, it would violate clue 1 because the scientist could not be to the right of them.


Given these placements, the table can now be solved by elimination for the remaining characteristics:

From clue 2, we know that the owner of the snake is to the right of the person drinking almond-milk. This means the person drinking almond-milk cannot own a snake, and must be in column 1. The snake's owner must be in column 2.
