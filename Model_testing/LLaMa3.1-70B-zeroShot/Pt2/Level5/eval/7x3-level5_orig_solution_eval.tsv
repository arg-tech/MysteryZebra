Lv5-7x3-1	"Here is the solved puzzle:


|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |
| Beverage      | juice    | water   | soy-milk|
| Food          | pepper   | zucchini| peach   |
| Job           | accountant| russian | freelancer|
| Movie-Genre   | action    | scientific| musical |
| Music-Genre   | rock      | jazz     | d&b     |
| Nationality   | chinese  | russian | italian |
| Pet           | goat      | hamster | hedgehog|

Here's a brief explanation of the solution process:

From clue 3, we know that juice is on the far left.

From clue 9, we know that the Russian is in the middle. Since there are only three people, this means the Russian must be in position 2.

From clue 6, we know that the Russian (in position 2) is to the left of the fan of jazz. This means the fan of jazz must be in position 3.

From clue 11, we know that the person watching scientific movies is eating peach. From clue 1, we know that this person is also on the right of the person watching action movies. Since there are only three positions, this means that the person watching action movies must be in position 1, and the person watching scientific movies (eating peach) must be in position 3.

From clue 2, we know that the freelancer is to the left of the owner of the goat. Since the freelancer cannot be on the far left (clue 5), this means the freelancer must be in position 2 or 3. However, if the freelancer were in position 3, then the owner of the goat would have to be to their right, which is not possible since there are no positions to the right of 3. Therefore, the freelancer must be in position 2.

From clue 5, we know that the freelancer is to the right of the Chinese. This means the Chinese must be in position 1.

From clue 12, we know that the owner of the hamster is on the right of the accountant. Since the owner of the goat cannot be in position 1 (clue 2), this means the owner of the hamster must be in position 3. However, this would put the hamster's owner to the right of the freelancer, which contradicts clue 7. Therefore, the owner of the hamster must be in position 2, and the accountant must be in position 1.

From clue 8, we know that the person eating zucchini is on the right of the fan of d&b. Since the fan of jazz is already in position 3 (from earlier), this means the fan of d&b must be in position 2 or 1. However, if the fan of d&b were in position 1, then the person eating zucchini would have to be in a non-existent position to their right. Therefore, the fan of d&b must be in position 2.

From clue 4, we know that the person eating pepper is in an odd position. This means they cannot be in position 2 (which is even). Since they are not already assigned to positions 1 or 3, this means the person eating pepper must be in either position 1 or 3. However, if they were in position 3, then the person watching scientific movies (eating peach) would have to be to their right, which contradicts clue 1. Therefore, the person eating pepper must be in position 1.

From clue 10, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person drinking water. Since there are only three positions, this means the person drinking water must be in either position 1 or 2. However, if they were in position 1, then the person drinking juice (already assigned to position 1) would have to be to their left, which contradicts clue 3. Therefore, the person drinking water must be in position 2.

The remaining positions can now be filled in with the remaining values.

#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 7, we know the fan of salsa is on the far left. Clue 1 tells us that this person is on the left or right of the person watching sports movies. Since salsa is already placed on the left, the person watching sports movies must be in position 2.

Clue 5 places the fan of soul to the left of the manager. Since the fan of soul is also the owner of the rat (clue 12), we can place them in position 2, and the manager in position 3.

From clue 10, we know that snowboarding is somewhere to the left of baseball. Clue 8 tells us that baseball is on the left or right of juice, so we can place juice in position 2 (which we already determined is occupied by soul/rat). This means baseball must be in position 3.

Clue 9 places fanta to the right of the owner of the cat. Since fanta is already in position 1, the owner of the cat must be in position 1 as well. Clue 2 tells us that the german is on the right of the cat, so german must be in position 3.

Clue 11 places spanish to the left of parkour. We can place spanish in position 1 (since salsa is already there) and parkour in position 2 (since soul/rat is also there).

The remaining clues helped me fill in the rest of the gaps, and the final solution is above.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* Clue 4 tells us that the person who likes cycling is on the far left, so we can fill in the sport for column 1.
* Clue 6 tells us that the dancer eats orange, and clue 10 tells us that the person eating peas is on the left of the person who's hobby is traveling. This means that the person eating nectarine must be on the far left (column 1).
* Clue 13 tells us that the owner of the pony is on the left of the person eating orange, which means the pony must be in column 1.
* Clue 3 tells us that the owner of the goat is on the left of the person who's hobby is photography. Since the pony is already in column 1, the goat must be in column 2.
* Clue 5 tells us that the owner of the guinea-pig is somewhere to the right of the person driving the car. This means the guinea-pig must be in column 3.
* Clue 8 tells us that the person driving the car is somewhere to the left of the colombian, which means the car must be in either column 1 or 2. However, clue 11 tells us that the person driving the trike is between the american and the person who's sport is climbing. This means the car cannot be in column 1 (since it would not be to the left of the colombian). Therefore, the car must be in column 2.
* Clue 11 also tells us that the person driving the trike is between the american and the person who's sport is climbing. Since the colombian is already in column 2, the american must be in either column 1 or 3. However, clue 2 tells us that the colombian is between the indian and the american, so the american cannot be in column 1 (since it would not be to the right of the indian). Therefore, the american must be in column 3.
* The rest of the clues can be used to fill in the remaining blanks.

I hope this solution is correct!"	{'food': ['nectarine', 'orange', 'peas'], 'hobby': ['traveling', 'photography', 'baking'], 'job': ['mechanic', 'dancer', 'journalist'], 'nationality': ['indian', 'colombian', 'american'], 'pet': ['pony', 'goat', 'guinea-pig'], 'sport': ['cycling', 'climbing', 'snowboarding'], 'transport': ['trike', 'car', 'scooter']}	True	10	False

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

* From clue 3, we know the Polish person is on the far right, so column 3 must be Polish.
* Clue 1 tells us that the Indian person is a fan of soul music, and from clue 10, we know they are to the right of the person drinking milk. So, column 2 cannot be Indian (since the person in column 2 drinks mirinda), which means column 3 must be Indian.
* Now, from clue 4, we know that the person drinking fanta is on the right of the fan of trance music. Since the Indian person in column 3 drinks milk (by elimination), the person in column 2 must drink mirinda and be a fan of trance music.
* Clue 11 tells us that the person watching fantasy movies is to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies, so column 1 must watch fantasy movies.
* From clue 7, we know that the person watching time-travel movies is between the person eating grapefruit and the person who's hobby is puzzles. This means column 2 watches time-travel movies and has a puzzle hobby (since the person in column 1 eats asparagus).
* Clue 5 tells us that the person eating asparagus is on the left or right of the fan of soul music, which is in column 3. Since column 2 eats grapefruit, column 1 must eat asparagus.
* From clue 9, we know that the owner of the pony is a fan of reggae music, and from clue 6, we know they are on the same side as the person eating asparagus (in column 1). So, column 2 owns a pony.
* Clue 12 tells us that the fan of soul music is to the left of the person who's hobby is writing. Since the Indian person in column 3 has a soul hobby and the person in column 2 has a puzzle hobby, the person in column 1 must have a camping hobby (by elimination).
* Finally, from clue 8, we know that the person eating asparagus (in column 1) is on the same side as the owner of the rat. Since column 3 owns a dog and column 2 owns a pony, column 1 must own a rat.
