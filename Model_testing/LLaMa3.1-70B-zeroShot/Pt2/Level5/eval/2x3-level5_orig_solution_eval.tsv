Lv5-2x3-1	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a possible solution:


|         |     1      |   2    |    3     |
| Pet     | Chinchilla | Turtle | Dog      |
| Sport   | Baseball   | Badminton | Soccer |

However, this solution doesn't quite fit the clues. Let's re-examine them:

From clue 2, we know that the owner of the dog is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton.

From clue 3, we know that the owner of the turtle is somewhere to the right of the owner of the dog. This means that Badminton must be in column 1 or 2.

Now, let's try again:


|         |     1      |   2    |    3     |
| Pet     |            |        |          |
| Sport   |            |        |          |

We know from clue 2 that the owner of the dog is on the right of Badminton. If we put Badminton in column 1, then Dog would be in column 2 or 3.

We also know from clue 3 that the owner of the turtle is to the right of the owner of the dog. This means that Turtle must be in column 3.

So, we get:


|         |     1      |   2    |    3     |
| Pet     |            | Dog    | Turtle   |
| Sport   | Badminton |        |          |

From clue 1, we know that the person who's sport is baseball is on the far left or far right. Since Baseball can't be in column 1 (it would contradict clue 2), it must be in column 3.

However, this would put Baseball and Turtle in the same column, which isn't possible. So, let's try putting Baseball in column 1:


|         |     1      |   2    |    3     |
| Pet     |            | Dog    |          |
| Sport   | Baseball   |        |          |

Now we can fill in the remaining blanks:


|         |     1      |   2    |    3     |
| Pet     | Chinchilla | Dog    | Turtle   |

Lv5-2x3-2	"Based on the given clues, I'll solve the puzzle step by step:


From clue 2, we know that the person drinking juice is to the right of the person watching satire movies.

From clue 4, we know that the person watching family movies is to the left of the person watching scientific movies.


Let's start filling in the table:

|               |   1    |   2    |       3       |
| Beverage      | cola?  | juice? | hot-cho    te |
| Movie-Genre   | family?| satire?| scientific? |

From clue 3, we know that the person drinking juice is to the right of the person drinking cola.


So, column 1 must be cola:


|               |   1    |   2    |       3       |
| Beverage      | cola   | ?     | hot-cho    te |
| Movie-Genre   | family?| satire?| scientific? |

From clue 4, we know that the person watching family movies is to the left of the person watching scientific movies.


So, column 1 must be family:


|               |   1    |   2    |       3       |
| Beverage      | cola   | ?     | hot-cho    te |
| Movie-Genre   | family | satire?| scientific |

From clue 2, we know that the person drinking juice is to the right of the person watching satire movies.


So, column 2 must be satire:


|               |   1    |   2    |       3       |
| Beverage      | cola   | ?     | hot-cho    te |
| Movie-Genre   | family | satire | scientific |

From clue 3, we know that the person drinking juice is to the right of the person drinking cola.


So, column 2 must be juice:


|               |   1    |   2    |       3       |
| Beverage      | cola   | juice  | hot-cho    te |
| Movie-Genre   | family | satire | scientific |

From clue 1, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is to the right of the person drinking juice.


So, column 3 must be hot-chocolate:


|               |   1    |   2    |       3       |
| Beverage      | cola   | juice  | hot-cho    te |
| Movie-Genre   | family | satire | scientific |

The final solution is:


#############
 
|               |   1    |   2    |       3       |
| Beverage      | cola   | juice  | hot-chocolate|

Lv5-2x3-3	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 1, we know the owner of the hamster is to the right of the owner of the rat.
From clue 2, we know the owner of the mouse is to the left of the owner of the rat.

Combining these two clues, we can conclude that the order of pets is: Mouse, Rat, Hamster (from left to right).

Now, let's look at the nationalities:

From clue 3, we know the Chinese is to the right of the Nigerian.
From clue 4, we know the Russian is to the left of the Chinese.

Combining these two clues, we can conclude that the order of nationalities is: Russian, Nigerian, Chinese (from left to right).

Now, let's combine the pets and nationalities:

We have three possible combinations:
Russian-Mouse, Nigerian-Rat, Chinese-Hamster

But wait! We don't know which nationality corresponds to which pet. However, we can try different combinations and see if they satisfy all the clues.

After trying different combinations, I found a solution that satisfies all the clues:


#############
|               |    1     |    2    |    3    |
| Nationality   | Russian  | Nigerian| Chinese |
| Pet           | Mouse    | Rat     | Hamster|
#############

This solution satisfies all the clues:

* The owner of the hamster (Chinese) is to the right of the owner of the rat (Nigerian).
* The owner of the mouse (Russian) is to the left of the owner of the rat (Nigerian).
* The Chinese is to the right of the Nigerian.
* The Russian is to the left of the Chinese.

So, this solution is correct!"	{'nationality': ['russian', 'nigerian', 'chinese'], 'pet': ['mouse', 'rat', 'hamster']}	True	4	False
Lv5-2x3-4	"Let's analyze the clues step by step:


From clue 2, we know that Biathlon is in the middle column (column 2).


From clue 1, we know that Corn is to the left of Plum.


From clue 3, we know that Plum is to the right of Biathlon. Since Biathlon is in the middle column, Plum must be in column 3.


Now, from clue 4, we know that Corn is to the right of Golf. This means that Golf cannot be in column 2 (since Corn would then have to be in column 3, but we already established that Plum is in column 3). Therefore, Golf must be in column 1.


So far, we have:


|         |   1    |    2     |   3    |
| Food    | Golf?  |          |        |
| Sport   |        | Biathlon |        |

Since Corn is to the right of Golf (clue 4), and Plum is in column 3, Corn must be in column 2.


We are left with:


|         |   1    |    2     |   3    |
| Food    | Golf?  | Corn     | Plum   |
| Sport   |        | Biathlon |        |

The only sport left for column 1 is Soccer. For column 3, we have Tomato as the remaining food option.


Here's the final solution:


#############

Lv5-2x3-5	"Let's break down the clues:


1. The person driving the scooter is on the far left.
	* This means that Column 1 is a scooter, and we can fill in the Transport row accordingly.

|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |
| Nationality   |         |          |           |
| Transport     | Scooter |          |           |

2. The person driving the trike is the Egyptian.
	* This means that one of the columns has a Trike in the Transport row, and an Egyptian in the Nationality row.

3. The Turkish is somewhere to the right of the Egyptian.
	* Since the Egyptian can't be on the far left ( Column 1), they must be in either Column 2 or Column 3.


Let's try placing the Egyptian in Column 2:


|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |
| Nationality   |         | Egyptian |           |
| Transport     | Scooter | Trike    |           |

Now, since the Turkish is to the right of the Egyptian, they must be in Column 3.


|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |
| Nationality   |         | Egyptian | Turkish   |
| Transport     | Scooter | Trike    |           |

Finally, we can fill in the remaining blank with the only nationality left (Spanish) and the only transport left (Quad-bike):


#############

Lv5-2x3-6	"Let's analyze the clues:


From clue 1, we know that the person who likes techno has a hobby of rock-climbing.


From clue 2, we know that the fan of dubstep is to the left of the person who dances.


From clue 3, we know that the person who rock-climbs is to the right of the person who dances.


Let's combine these clues:


Since the techno fan rock-climbs (clue 1) and the rock-climber is to the right of the dancer (clue 3), we can conclude that the dancer is in column 2, and the rock-climber is in column 3.


Now, since the dubstep fan is to the left of the dancer (clue 2), the dubstep fan must be in column 1.


The only music genre left is metal, which must be associated with the person who dances.


Here's the solution:

Lv5-2x3-7	"Based on the given clues, let's analyze and fill in the table:

From clue 2, we know the security-guard is to the left of volleyball. Since there are only three columns, this means volleyball must be in column 2 or 3.


From clue 1, skiing is to the right of badminton. Considering the possible positions for volleyball and the fact that skiing must be to the right of badminton, we can deduce a few things:


- If volleyball were in column 2, badminton would have to be in column 1, which leaves no space for skiing to be to the right of badminton. Thus, volleyball cannot be in column 2.


This means volleyball must be in column 3. Given this arrangement and combining it with clue 2, we get:


|         |       1        |     2      |         3          |
| Job     |                |            |                    |
| Sport   | Badminton      | Skiing     | Volleyball         |

Now, let's place the jobs. From clue 2, the security-guard is to the left of volleyball, which places the security-guard in either column 1 or 2. Since badminton already occupies column 1 and skiing must be to its right (column 2), the security-guard must be in column 1.


|         |       1        |     2      |         3          |
| Job     | Security-Guard |            |                    |
| Sport   | Badminton      | Skiing     | Volleyball         |

Clue 3 states that the software-developer is to the right of volleyball, but since there are no columns to the right of column 3, this clue doesn't help with positioning jobs. However, we can deduce from it that volleyball cannot be paired with a software-developer.


Since the security-guard is in column 1 and badminton's sport matches with it, and skiing must be in column 2 (as per clue 1), we need to figure out which job goes with skiing and which with volleyball.


Given that the software-developer is to the right of volleyball but cannot pair with volleyball itself due to being in a non-existent column 4, this actually means the software-developer must be paired with skiing. Volleyball then pairs with the only remaining job, teacher.


The final arrangement is:


#############

Lv5-2x3-8	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|         |    1    |    2     |     3     |
| Hobby   | reading | drawing  | baking    |
| Job     | designer| pilot    | fisherman |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 2, we know that the person who likes drawing is to the right of the person who likes reading. So, reading must be in column 1.

From clue 3, we know that the designer is on either side of the person who likes reading. Since reading is in column 1, the designer must be in column 1 as well (because there's no one to the left of column 1).

From clue 4, we know that the designer is to the left of the fisherman. So, the fisherman cannot be in column 1 (since the designer is already in column 1). The fisherman must be in either column 2 or 3.

Now, from clue 1, we know that the person who likes drawing is to the left of the fisherman. If the fisherman were in column 3, then the person who likes drawing would have to be in column 2. But this would mean that the designer (who is already in column 1) is not on either side of the person who likes reading (which is in column 1). So, the fisherman must be in column 3.

The only remaining hobby is baking, which must go in column 3 with the fisherman. The only remaining job is pilot, which goes in column 2 with drawing.

Lv5-2x3-9	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 1, we know that lemonade is to the right of airplane.

From clue 2, we know that scooter is to the right of quad-bike.

From clue 3, we know that 7up is to the left of coffee.

From clue 4, we know that scooter is in an odd position (i.e., either position 1 or 3).

Let's start by placing the airplane and lemonade. Since lemonade is to the right of airplane, we can place them as follows:

|             |     1     |    2     |    3     |
| Beverage    |           |          |          |
| Transport   | Airplane  | Lemonade |          |

Now, let's consider the scooter. Since it's in an odd position and to the right of quad-bike, we can place them as follows:

|             |     1     |    2     |    3     |
| Beverage    |           |          |          |
| Transport   | Airplane  | Quad-bike| Scooter |

Now, let's consider the beverages. Since lemonade is already placed in position 2, we can place 7up and coffee as follows:

|             |     1     |    2     |    3     |
| Beverage    | 7up      | Lemonade | Coffee   |

Lv5-2x3-10	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 1, we know the mechanic is either in column 1 or column 3.

From clue 4, we know the freelancer is to the left of the mechanic. Since the freelancer can't be on the far right (otherwise, there would be no one to the left of the mechanic), this means the freelancer must be in column 1 or 2, and the mechanic must be in column 2 or 3.

Now let's consider clue 2: ""the fan of salsa is somewhere to the right of the fan of house"". This implies that the fan of salsa can't be on the far left. If they were, there would be no one to their left to satisfy this condition. Therefore, the fan of salsa must be in column 2 or 3.

From clue 3: ""the fan of house is between the fan of salsa and the fan of reggae"". We already know that the fan of salsa is not on the far left, so this implies that the fan of house must also be to the right of someone (since they are ""between"" two people). Therefore, the fan of house can't be in column 1.

Putting all these together:

* The freelancer is in column 1 or 2.
* The mechanic is in column 2 or 3.
* The fan of salsa is in column 2 or 3.
* The fan of house is not on the far left and must be between two people, so they can only be in column 2.

Therefore:

|               |    1     |     2      |    3     |
| Job           | Freelancer | Engineer  | Mechanic |
| Music-Genre   | House      | Salsa     | Reggae   |

 Wait, why did I put the engineer there?

The reason is that if we look at the constraints:

* The freelancer is in column 1.
* The mechanic is on the far left or far right (clue 1), so they must be in column 3 (because if they were in column 1, the freelancer would not be to their left as per clue 4).
* The fan of salsa is somewhere to the right of the fan of house (clue 2). This means that salsa can't be in column 1.
* The fan of house is between the fan of salsa and the fan of reggae (clue 3).

If we put the freelancer in column 1, it satisfies all these conditions. Now the only remaining job for column 2 is the engineer.
