Note: The numbers in the puzzle statements refer to the column number, where ##1 means ""in the first column"" and so on.

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:

* From clue 10, we know that cricket is on the far left.
* Clue 14 tells us that corn is eaten by the mechanic, who must be in column 1 since cricket is on the far left (clue 6).
* Clue 5 tells us that lettuce is to the right of corn, so it must be in column 2.
* Clue 9 says that the coach is to the left of lettuce, which means the coach must be in column 3.
* Clue 2 places the fan of house between the lawyer and the coach. Since the coach is already placed, the fan of house must be in column 3 as well.
* We know from clue 7 that lacrosse is to the right of the lawyer. Also, clue 4 says that lacrosse is between the russian and brazilian nationalities. Therefore, lacrosse must be in column 2 (the only spot available for it).
* Clue 8 says that indonesian is next to tomato. Since lacrosse is already placed in column 2, indonesian can't be there, which means tomato must be in either column 3 or 4.
* From clue 13, we know that brazilian is to the right of pomegranate. Therefore, pomegranate can only fit in column 3 (the remaining spot).
* Clue 11 says that camping is between cycling and pomegranate. Cycling can't be next to cricket (because fishing is on the left of cricket), so it must be on the right side. This means pomegranate is in column 2, which we already determined.
* With these constraints in place, the remaining spots fall into place.

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 1, the polish person is on the far left.

From clue 4, the polish person must be in an odd position, so they are in position 1 or 3. But from clue 2, the owner of the fish is on the far left or far right, and since the polish person can't own a fish (because of clue 4), the polish person must be in position 1.

From clue 17, the person drinking 7up is on the far left or far right. Since the polish person is already in position 1, the person drinking 7up must also be in position 1.

From clue 10, the indian person is on the left of the person driving the skateboard. So the indian person can't be in position 4.

From clue 11, the person who's sport is parkour is somewhere to the right of the teacher. Since the polish person is already in position 1 and drinking 7up, they must be the teacher (because there are no other options for them).

From clue 5, the firefighter is on the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting.

From clue 12, the owner of the hamster is somewhere to the left of the person drinking juice. Since the indian person can't own a hamster (because of clue 10), the owner of the hamster must be in position 1 or 2.

From clue 3, the owner of the hamster is on the left or right of the person driving the skateboard. So the owner of the hamster must be in position 2.

From clue 14, the person driving the scooter is between the person drinking mirinda and the owner of the rabbit. Since the polish person is already in position 1 and the indian person can't own a rabbit (because of clue 10), the person driving the scooter must be in position 2.

The rest of the puzzle can be solved by filling in the remaining blanks with the available options.

| Transport     | Car      | Snowmobile  | Bike        | Tram        |

Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. From clue 2, we know the fan of house is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is singing. Since there are only two possible positions for this pair (1-2 or 3-4), and considering other clues, we'll place them in columns 2 and 3.
2. Clue 9 states that the fan of folk is between the Pakistani and the person driving the bike. This means the Pakistani must be on one side, and the person driving the bike on the other. Since the person watching epic movies drives the bike (clue 4), we can place them in columns 3 and 2 or 1 and 2.
3. Clue 7 tells us that the person watching romance movies is the Pakistani. We'll place the Pakistani in column 1, as they must be on the left side of the fan of folk (clue 9).
4. From clue 12, we know that the person who's hobby is traveling is the Pakistani. This confirms our placement of the Pakistani in column 1.
5. Clue 10 states that the Indonesian is the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since they can't be on an even position (clue 1), we'll place them in column 2.
6. From clue 11, we know that the person who's hobby is woodworking watches western movies. This confirms our placement of the Indonesian in column 2.
7. Clue 13 tells us that the fan of trance is the Pakistani. We already placed the Pakistani in column 1, so this clue confirms it.
8. From clue 16, we know that the owner of the chinchilla is the fan of trance (Pakistani). This helps to fill in the pet information.
9. Clue 15 tells us that the Malaysian is somewhere to the left of the owner of the fish. Since the owner of the fish drives the tram (clue 17), we can place them in column 4, with the Malaysian on their left (column 3).
10. Clue 14 states that the owner of the pony is on the left of the fan of trance. This means the pony's owner must be on the left side of the Pakistani (fan of trance). We'll place them in column 1.
11. The remaining information can be filled in using the other clues.

Please let me know if this solution is correct!



Here's a brief explanation of my thought process:

From clue 2, we know the Italian is on the far right. From clue 3, we know the doctor drives the train. Combining these clues with clue 4, we can deduce that the doctor (train) is in column 3.

Clue 11 tells us the person eating cranberry is to the left of the doctor. Since the writer must be to the left of the security-guard (clue 6), and the person eating cranberry is to the right of the writer (clue 18), we can conclude that the writer is in column 1, the person eating cranberry is in column 2, and the doctor is indeed in column 3.

From clue 7, we know the person eating corn is to the right of the person driving the tram. Clue 17 tells us the person driving the tram is to the left of the person driving the van. This means the person driving the tram must be in column 2 or 3. Since the doctor (train) is already in column 3, the person driving the tram must be in column 2.

Clue 14 tells us the Argentine is on the right of the person watching western movies and is also on the left or right of the person driving the tram. This means the Argentine cannot be in column 4 (since the Italian is already there). The Argentine must be in either column 1, 2, or 3.

Combining all these deductions, we can start filling in the table:

* Column 1: writer, jet-ski, martial-arts, raspberry, biathlon, pakistani
* Column 2: dancer, tram, western, cranberry, surfing, brazilian
* Column 3: doctor, train, documentary, corn, skateboarding, argentine
* Column 4: security-guard, van, animation, watermelon, ice-hockey, italian

From clue 5, we know the person watching documentary movies is on the left or right of the person driving the train. This confirms our placement of the doctor (train) and the person watching documentary movies.

The remaining clues can be used to confirm the correctness of our solution, but they don't provide any additional information that would change the table.

Here's how I solved it:


1. From clue 8, we know the person drinking tea is driving a quad-bike.
2. From clue 16, we know the person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the person driving the helicopter.
3. Since there are only two options for the far-left position (clue 13), and the person driving the helicopter can't be in column 1 (because the quad-bike is to their left), the person driving the helicopter must be in column 4, and the person driving the quad-bike must be in column 1.
4. From clue 8, we know the person drinking tea is driving a quad-bike, so they are in column 1, with beverage ""tea"".
5. From clue 6, we know the person watching romance movies is to the left of the person drinking mirinda.
6. From clue 11, we know the person eating zucchini is to the right of the person watching romance movies.
7. Since there are only two columns left for these three people (columns 2-3), and the person watching romance movies must be in column 2, the person eating zucchini must be in column 3, and the person drinking mirinda must be in column 2.
8. From clue 12, we know the person watching adventure movies is to the right of the person drinking mirinda, so they are in column 3.
9. Now we have:

10. From clue 1, we know the person drinking cola is to the left of the fan of gospel.
11. Since there are only two columns left for these two people (columns 3-4), and the person watching adventure movies must be in column 3, the person drinking cola must be in column 3 or 4, but since mirinda is already in column 2, cola can't be in column 3. So, cola must be in column 4.
