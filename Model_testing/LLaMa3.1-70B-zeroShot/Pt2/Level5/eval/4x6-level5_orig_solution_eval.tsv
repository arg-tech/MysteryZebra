#############


Explanation:


From clue 2, the person eating grapefruit is the dressmaker.
From clue 3, the person who's sport is parkour is the person eating grapefruit, so parkour must be in position 3.
From clue 13, the person eating grapefruit is between the librarian and the person eating cabbage. So, the order for positions 1-3 is: asparagus-librarian-parkour-dressmaker-grapefruit-cabbage.
From clue 11, the person eating asparagus is on the right of the person who's sport is parkour, which supports this ordering.

The remaining clues can be used to fill in the rest of the table:

* Clue 9 places swimming between journalist and pineapple.
* Clue 10 places d&b to the left of swimming.
* Clue 8 places asparagus to the left of d&b.
* Clue 15 places strawberry on the left of swimming, which means it's in position 4.
* Clue 7 identifies rugby as the librarian, who is already placed in position 1 due to the earlier deductions.
* Clue 14 places strawberry on either side of rugby (already placed), so it must be in position 4.
* Clue 16 places folk in an even position; since all odd positions are filled except for 5, folk can only go in position 2 or 6. But clue 21 states that folk is in an even position, which eliminates option 6 and puts folk in position 2.

The remaining music genres can be deduced from the clues:
* Clue 18 places pop to the right of dressmaker.
* Clue 17 is redundant since it simply restates that country is country.
* Clue 4 places reggae with videographer, so reggae must be in position 5.
* Clue 12 places country to the right of baseball. This leaves jazz as the only option for position 6.

The remaining sports can also be deduced from the clues:
* Clue 20 places ice-hockey on either side of asparagus (already placed), so it must be in position 1.
* Clue 5 places rugby on either side of d&b, but since rugby is already identified with librarian in position 1, and d&b is in position 4, rugby can only go to the left of d&b. This means that baseball goes in position 2.

Finally, clue 19 states that teacher is in an odd position; the only remaining option for teacher is position 2.

| Transport     | jet-ski   |  tram        | van       | scooter    | taxi      | skateboard |

Here's the explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 3, we know the analyst is on the far right. From clue 19, we also know that the person driving the skateboard is on the far right. Combining these two clues with clue 17, which states that the Indonesian is on the far right, we can determine that the Indonesian is the scientist.

From clue 1, we know that the Polish is in an even position, so it must be either #2 or #4. Clue 20 then tells us that the Russian is between the Polish and the person driving the van. Since the Russian cannot be on the far right (because of the Indonesian), the Russian must be at #5.

From clue 15, we know that the person eating blueberry is to the left of the Polish, so the blueberry-eater must be either #1 or #3. Clue 16 then tells us that the person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the chef, and since the person driving the tram (from clue 10) is between the jet-skier and the van driver, we can determine that the blueberry-eater is at #2.

From clue 5, we know that the dancer eats lettuce. From clue 8, we also know that the person eating pomegranate is to the left of the dancer. This means that the pomegranate-eater must be either #3 or #4.

Clue 6 tells us that the person driving the van is on the left or right of the eggplant-eater. Since the Russian is at #5, and the Polish is in an even position, the eggplant-eater cannot be at #2 (because it would have to be either the Russian or the Polish). Therefore, the eggplant-eater must be at #3.

From clue 4, we know that the person eating eggplant is to the left of the British. This means that the British must be at #4.

The rest of the solution can be determined by filling in the remaining clues:

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:


From clues 13 and 17, we know that the person who owns the turtle is in position 1 and has writing as their hobby.

Clue 7 tells us that the person who owns the turtle also enjoys weightlifting.

Clue 18 suggests that the owner of the frog is either on the far left or right. But since clue 24 says the architect is to the left of the frog's owner, the frog must be in position 3 (because the architect can't be in position 1).

From clue 5, we know the horse is either to the left or right of the turtle, so it must be in position 6.

Clue 23 tells us that woodworking is an even-numbered hobby. Given the placement of filmmaking and skydiving from clues 2 and 21, woodworking must be in position 4.

Using clue 25, we can place water-polo next to woodworking.

From clue 12, we know soccer is between the videographer and the fish owner. Since the videographer can't be in position 6 (because of the horse), they must be in position 5.

The rest of the puzzle falls into place using a combination of the remaining clues.

Lv5-4x6-7	"Here is the step-by-step solution to the logic puzzle:


### Initial deductions


From clue 12, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is on the far left.


From clue 4, we know that the person driving the taxi is in an even position and on the far right. Therefore, the person driving the taxi must be in position 6 (since it's an even number and at the far right).


### Deductions from clues


Using clue 5, we can deduce that the owner of the dog is to the right of the person driving the subway.


Using clue 7, we know that the owner of the dog is in an even position. Since the person driving the taxi (in position 6) cannot be on the left of the owner of the dog, the owner of the dog must be in position 4 or 2 (to satisfy both conditions). However, since clue 7 specifies that it's an even position, and we already have a constraint on position 6, the owner of the dog must be in position 4.


Using clue 3, we can deduce that the person driving the taxi is indeed at position 6.


### Further deductions


From clue 10, we know that the person driving the van is to the right of the person driving the boat. Since the person driving the van cannot be on the far left or right (due to constraints), it must be in position 3 or 5.


Using clue 1, we can deduce that the person driving the subway is either at position 2 or 4, since the person driving the van is on its left or right. However, since the owner of the dog is already assigned to position 4 (from above), the person driving the subway must be in position 2.


### Nationality and pet constraints


From clue 6, we know that the Spanish person is to the left of the owner of the dog (in position 4). Therefore, the Spanish person can only be at positions 1 or 3. However, since writing is already assigned to position 1, the Spanish person must be in position 3.


From clue 9, we know that the Polish person is on the right of the Colombian person. This means they cannot both be at the start or end of the table, so one must be at an odd position and the other at an even position (that isn't already assigned). We can deduce that the Canadian person must also fit between these two constraints.


### Hobby constraints


Using clue 13, we know that singing is to the right of gardening. Since video-games is somewhere to the left of Canadian (clue 15), it cannot be immediately after gardening (due to clue 14). This means that rock-climbing or filmmaking must separate video-games from gardening.


From clue 16, we can deduce that singing is between horse and van (from the person's hobby perspective).

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* Clue 5 states that the owner of the hamster is to the left of the person eating strawberry. Since the designer is to the right of the hamster (clue 16), and the designer is in an even position, we can place the strawberry-eater in position 3 or 5.
* The chinese is on the left of the person eating carrot (clue 14), so we can place the chinese in position 1. Clue 18 tells us that the owner of the horse is the chinese, so we can fill in the pet column for this row.
* From clue 19, the egyptian is to the right of the doctor, and from clue 21, the egyptian is to the left of the malaysian. We can place the egyptian in position 5, which means the malaysian must be in position 6 (since the italian is to the left of the canadian, and the designer is to the right of the malaysian).
* The person eating apple is in an even position (clue 3), so they must be in position 4. Clue 10 states that the mechanic is on the right of the person eating apple, which places the mechanic in position 6.
* Clues 20 and 23 tell us that the person eating papaya is to the left or right of the owner of the rabbit, and also to the right of the owner of the goldfish. We can place the papaya-eater in position 1.

4. From clue 16, we know that the owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the owner of the cat. Since the person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog (clue 3), we can place the hedgehog and parkour in column 3.
5. From clue 4, we know that the bartender is to the left of the writer. We also know that the pilot is to the right of the coach (clue 5) and to the right of the person who's sport is water-polo (clue 17). This helps us place the pilot in column 4.

7. From clue 13, we know that the owner of the frog is on the far right, which places it in column 6.
