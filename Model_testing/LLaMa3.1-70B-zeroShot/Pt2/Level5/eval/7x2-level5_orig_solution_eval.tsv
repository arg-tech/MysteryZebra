Lv5-7x2-1	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#################
|               |      1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | cola         | milk       |
| Food          | broccoli     | cabbage    |
| Hobby         | skydiving    | gardening  |
| Job           | entrepreneur | manager    |
| Music-Genre   | soul         | punk       |
| Sport         | surfing      | water-polo |
| Transport     | ship         | roller     |
#################


Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 1, we know that the person who surfs is to the left of the person who skydives.

From clue 2, we know that the fan of soul is to the left of the fan of punk.

From clue 3, we know that the manager is to the right of the person eating broccoli.

From clue 4, we know that the person drinking milk is to the right of the person driving the ship.

Combining these clues, we can start building the table:

* The person who surfs must be in column 1 (since they're to the left of the skydiver).
* The fan of soul must also be in column 1 (since they're to the left of the punk fan).
* Broccoli must be eaten by someone in column 1, since the manager is to their right.
* Cola must be drunk by someone in column 1, since milk is drunk by someone to the right of the ship-driver.

Now we can fill in the rest of the table:

* The person who eats cabbage and drinks milk must be in column 2 (since they're to the right of the broccoli-eater).
* The manager must be in column 2, since they're to the right of the broccoli-eater.
* The fan of punk music must also be in column 2, since they're to the right of the soul fan.

The rest of the table falls into place from there!"	{'beverage': ['cola', 'milk'], 'food': ['broccoli', 'cabbage'], 'hobby': ['skydiving', 'gardening'], 'job': ['entrepreneur', 'manager'], 'music-genre': ['soul', 'punk'], 'sport': ['surfing', 'water-polo'], 'transport': ['ship', 'roller']}	True	12	False

From clue 3, the person driving the van is in an odd position. Since there are only two positions, this means the van driver must be in position 1.

From clue 5, the person eating raspberry is on the left or right of the owner of the snake. Since the person eating raspberry is already in position 1, this means the owner of the snake must be in position 2.

From clue 1, we know that the person watching superhero movies is on the right of the Nigerian. Let's place the Nigerian in column 1 for now.

| Transport     |            | Airplane |

From clue 5, we know that the person who's hobby is collecting is on the left of the person watching superhero movies. So, let's place the person with the hobby ""collecting"" in column 1.


|               |     1      |     2     |

From clue 4, we know that the owner of the dog is on the right of the person eating cherry. Let's assume that the person eating carrot is in column 1 for now.


|               |     1      |     2     |

Now, let's look at clue 3. We know that the person who's sport is cricket is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is basketball. Since the person with the hobby ""collecting"" can't have a pet (because of clue 4), they might have a sport instead.


|               |     1      |     2     |

The person with the hobby ""chess"" can't be in column 1 (because of clue 5), so they must be in column 2.


|               |     1      |     2     |

Now, let's look at the remaining clues. From clue 1, we know that the person watching superhero movies is on the right of the Nigerian, so the person in column 2 must be Mexican.

| Sport         | Basketball | Cricket  |
| Transport     |            | Airplane |

The person who eats carrot can't drive the airplane (because of clue 2), so they must use a trike.

| Sport         | badminton  | weightlifting|
| Transport     | airplane   |     boat      |

 

Here's a brief explanation of the steps taken to solve the puzzle:

From clue 4, we know that the fan of r&b is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton.

From clue 1, we know that the person watching comedy movies is on the left or right of the fan of r&b. Since the fan of r&b is already to the right of someone (badminton), it must be on the right side. This implies that the person watching comedy movies is on the left.

From clue 3, we know that the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left of the person driving the boat. Since there are only two people and two hobbies, this means that the other hobby (filmmaking) must be associated with the boat.

From clue 2, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the owner of the chinchilla. This implies that the owner of the chinchilla is on the left and drinks lemonade.

Putting all this information together yields the final solution above.

Lv5-7x2-5	"After analyzing the given clues, I came up with a solution that satisfies all conditions:


|               |         1          |     2      |
| Hobby         | sudoku            | collecting  |
| Job           | software-developer| lawyer       |

| Nationality   | pakistani         | polish       |
| Pet           | mouse             | turtle       |
| Sport         | parkour           | weightlifting|

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 4, we know that the person who likes parkour is on either side of the person who likes sudoku. Let's assume sudoku is in position 1 (this will be verified later). Then parkour must be in position 1 as well.


Clue 5 states that the fan of reggae is the owner of the turtle. Since there are only two positions, and reggae can't be paired with weightlifting (because polish needs to be to the right of weightlifting), reggae must be paired with action movies and turtle in position 2.


Now we have:


|               |         1          |     2      |
| Hobby         | sudoku            | ?           |
| Job           | ?                 | lawyer       |

| Sport         | parkour           | weightlifting|

From clue 2, we know that the owner of the turtle is in an even position. Therefore, collecting (the other hobby) must be paired with action movies and turtle.


Clue 3 states that polish is to the right of weightlifting, so pakistani must be paired with scientific movies.


Finally, from clue 1, lawyer must be on the right, which means software-developer must be in position 1.

Lv5-7x2-6	"After analyzing the clues, I've filled in the table with the correct information:


|               |     1     |     2      |
| Beverage      |  lemonade |  iced-tea  |
| Food          |  cranberry | plum       |
| Hobby         | puzzles    | camping    |
| Movie-Genre   | disaster   | horror     |
| Music-Genre   | dubstep    | salsa      |
| Sport         | surfing    | basketball |
| Transport     | quad-bike  | boat       |

Let me walk you through the reasoning:

* From clue 5, we know the person watching disaster movies is to the left of the person drinking iced-tea. This means the person in column 1 watches disaster movies.
* Clue 4 tells us that the person drinking iced-tea is a fan of salsa. So, the person in column 2 drinks iced-tea and likes salsa music.
* From clue 3, we know the fan of dubstep is to the left of the person driving the boat. This means the person in column 1 is a fan of dubstep, and the person in column 2 drives the boat.
* Clue 2 states that the person whose hobby is camping is to the right of the person whose sport is surfing. Since the person in column 1 watches disaster movies (and doesn't match any other clues), we can deduce that the person in column 1 also surfs, and the person in column 2 camps.
* From clue 1, we know the person eating plum is to the right of the person eating cranberry. This means the person in column 1 eats cranberry, and the person in column 2 eats plum.
* Finally, since the person in column 1 surfs (from clue 2), they must also prefer a sport other than basketball (which is left for the person in column 2).

Lv5-7x2-7	"I'll solve the logic puzzle and provide the completed table.


First, let's analyze the given clues:


1. The electrician is somewhere to the right of the dancer.
This implies that the dancer is in position 1, and the electrician is in position 2.


2. The fan of classical music is somewhere to the left of the owner of the bird.
This doesn't provide any direct information about the positions, but we'll come back to this later.


3. The person drinking water is in an odd position.
Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), this means that the person drinking water must be in position 1.


4. The person who's sport is lacrosse is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is swimming.
Similar to clue 2, this doesn't provide direct information about the positions yet.


5. The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the left of the spanish.
This implies that the helicopter driver cannot be in position 2 (since they must be to the left of someone), so they must be in position 1 or not present at all. However, given the other clues, it's more likely that the helicopter driver is indeed in position 1.


Now, let's start filling in the table:


|               |     1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | water      | fanta       |
| Job           | dancer     | electrician |
| Music-Genre   | classical  | techno      |
| Nationality   |            | spanish     |
| Pet           | bird       | rat         |
| Sport         | lacrosse   | swimming    |
| Transport     | helicopter | motorbike   |


The only remaining unknown is the nationality of person 1. Since the other person is Spanish, and we're not given any information about person 1's nationality, it must be British by default.


Here's the completed table:

Lv5-7x2-9	"Here is the solved puzzle:


|               |       1       |     2      |
| Hobby         | puzzles      | collecting |

| Sport         | skateboarding| volleyball  |
| Transport     | trike        | car         |

Here's how the solution was derived:


From clue 1, we know that the person whose hobby is puzzles is on the left of the Canadian. So the Canadian must be in column 2.


From clue 3, we know that the person watching western movies is the person whose hobby is collecting. Since the person with the hobby ""puzzles"" is already placed, the person with the hobby ""collecting"" must be in column 2.


From clue 4, we know that the fan of r&b is the chef. From clue 5, we know that the fan of r&b (i.e., the chef) is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is volleyball.


Since the Canadian is already placed in column 2, and the chef must be to the left of the person whose sport is volleyball, the chef must be in column 1. Therefore, the person with the job ""chef"" is also in column 1.


From clue 2, we know that the chef is driving a car. So the transport for column 1 is the car, and the transport for column 2 is the trike.


The remaining information can be filled in using the process of elimination:


* The person with the hobby ""puzzles"" must be in column 1.
* The person with the job ""teacher"" must be in column 1 (since the chef is already placed).
* The fan of soul music must be the teacher (since the r&b fan is already placed as the chef).
* The person watching time-travel movies must be in column 1 (since the western movie watcher is already placed in column 2).
* The person whose sport is skateboarding must be in column 1 (since the volleyball player is already placed in column 2).


The final solution table is:

Lv5-7x2-10	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a possible solution:


#############
|               |       1        |      2       |
| Job           | Police-Officer | Entrepreneur |
| Movie-Genre   | Musical        | Scientific    |
| Music-Genre   | Salsa          | Classical     |
| Nationality   | Argentine      | Indian        |
| Pet           | Dog            | Hedgehog      |
| Sport         | Rowing         | Cycling       |
| Transport     | Scooter        | Helicopter    |
#############


Here's how the clues led me to this solution:

* Clue 5 tells us that the person driving the scooter is on the far left, so we place the ""Scooter"" in column 1.
* Clue 3 tells us that the person who likes salsa music is on the right of the fan of cycling. Since the person with the scooter (column 1) can't be to the right of anyone, we place ""Cycling"" in column 2 and ""Salsa"" in column 1.
* Clue 4 tells us that the owner of the hedgehog is somewhere to the right of the owner of the dog. Since there are only two columns, this means the owner of the dog must be in column 1, and the owner of the hedgehog must be in column 2.
* Clue 2 tells us that the Indian person is on the right of the person watching scientific movies. This means we place ""Scientific"" in column 1 and ""Indian"" in column 2.
* Clue 1 tells us that the police-officer is on the left or right of the person watching musical movies. Since column 1 already has a job (police-officer wouldn't fit with salsa music), we place ""Police-Officer"" in column 1 and ""Musical"" in column 2, with ""Entrepreneur"" in column 2.
* Clue 3 also tells us that the person who likes cycling is on the right of the fan of salsa. We've already placed ""Cycling"" in column 2, so we're good!
* The remaining options fit nicely into place.
