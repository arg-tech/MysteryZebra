Lv5-1x7-1	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############

| Job   | Nurse | Lawyer | Accountant | Coach| Dressmaker | Manager | Musician|
#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 1 and 5, we know the lawyer is to the left of the accountant.
* Clue 3 tells us the nurse is to the left of the lawyer, so the first three positions are set: Nurse-Lawyer-Accountant.
* Clue 2 states that the dressmaker is to the left of the manager, and clue 9 confirms this. Clue 7 says the dressmaker is to the right of the coach, but also to the left of the manager (clue 2). Therefore, the middle three positions must be: Coach-Dressmaker-Manager.
* Clue 4 tells us the coach is to the left of the musician, and clue 6 states that the musician is on the far right. This means the last two positions are set: ...-Musician.
* Putting it all together, we get the solution above.

Lv5-1x7-3	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


|               |     1     |     2     |  3   |   4    |    5     |     6     |   7    |

|               | Thai      | Indian    | Amer.| Malysia| Colombian| Brazilian | German |


Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at the solution:


From clue 1, we know that the Indian is between the Thai and the American.


From clue 2, we know that the American is to the right of the Indian. Combining this with clue 1, we get: Thai - Indian - American


From clue 3, we know that the German is on the far right.


From clue 4, we know that the Colombian is between the Brazilian and the Thai. Since the Thai is already in position 1, the Brazilian must be to the left of the Colombian, but not necessarily directly adjacent (due to clue 5).


From clue 6, we know that the Brazilian is somewhere to the left of the Colombian.


Combining all these clues, we get:


Thai - Indian - American - Malaysian - Colombian - Brazilian - German


The only way this can fit in the given table is with some rearrangement:


Thai - Indian - American - Malysia - Colombian - Brazilian doesn't work since the Brazilian would be to the right of the Colombian. However, swapping the Colombian and Brazilian doesn't work either since that would contradict clue 4.


However, putting the Colombian between the Malaysian and Brazilian does satisfy all conditions!


Since the American is on the left or right of the Indian (clue 7), and we already have them in order (Thai - Indian - American), this condition is satisfied.


So the final solution table with '#############' around it is:


|               |     1     |     2     |  3   |   4    |    5     |     6     |   7    |

From clue 5, we know that gardening is between photography and camping.


From clue 6, we know that photography is to the left of gardening.


So, the order for these three hobbies is: photography - gardening - camping


Now, let's incorporate this information into our table:


| Hobby   |      1      |      2      |     3     |    4    |    5    |    6    |    7    |

|         | Photography | Gardening  | Camping   |         |         |         |         |


From clue 1, we know that camping is to the right of gardening.


This matches our current order, so no changes are needed.


Now, let's use clues 2 and 3 to determine the position of cooking:


Clue 2 states that cooking is to the right of woodworking.


Clue 3 states that camping is to the left of cooking.


So, we can conclude that the order for these three hobbies is: woodworking - camping - cooking


However, we already know the order for photography, gardening, and camping. Combining this information, we get:


| Hobby   |      1      |      2      |     3     |    4    |    5    |    6    |    7    |

|         | Photography | Gardening  | Camping   | Woodworking - ? |        |         |         |


Now, let's place woodworking:


From clue 7, we know that photography is to the right of woodworking.


So, woodworking must be in position 1:


| Hobby   |      1      |      2      |     3     |    4    |    5    |    6    |    7    |

|         | Woodworking | Photography | Gardening | Camping  |        |         |         |


Now, let's place cooking:


From clue 3, we know that camping is to the left of cooking.


So, cooking must be in position 5 or later:


| Hobby   |      1      |      2      |     3     |    4    |    5    |    6    |    7    |

|         | Woodworking | Photography | Gardening | Camping  | Cooking |         |         |


From clue 4, we know that cooking is to the left of puzzles.


So, puzzles must be in position 6 or later:


| Hobby   |      1      |      2      |     3     |    4    |    5    |    6    |    7    |

|         | Woodworking | Photography | Gardening | Camping  | Cooking | Puzzles |         |


Finally, let's place reading:


From clue 8, we know that puzzles is to the left of reading.


So, reading must be in position 7:


| Hobby   |      1      |      2      |     3     |    4    |    5    |    6    |    7    |

From clue 4, the fan of ambient is in the middle, so it must be at position 4.

|               |   1    |   2   |   3   |    4    |    5    |   6    |   7    |
| Music-Genre   |        |       |       | ambient |         |        |

From clue 6, the fan of house is on the left or right of the fan of ambient. Since there are already fans to the left and right of ambient (positions 3 and 5), house must be at position 3.

|               |   1    |   2   |   3   |    4    |    5    |   6    |   7    |
| Music-Genre   |        |       | house | ambient |         |        |

From clue 7, the fan of dubstep is on the right of the fan of ambient. Dubstep must be at position 5 or 6. From clue 9, gospel is to the left of dubstep. Gospel can't be at position 1 (clue 2), so it's more likely that gospel is at position 3 or 4. However, house is already at position 3, and ambient is at position 4. So gospel must be at position 2.

|               |   1    |   2   |   3   |    4    |    5    |   6    |   7    |
| Music-Genre   |        | gospel| house | ambient |         |        |

From clue 8, metal is on the left or right of the fan of house. Since house is at position 3, and there's already a genre to its right (ambient), metal must be at position 1 or 2. However, gospel is already at position 2, so metal can't be next to house. There must be another genre between them.

From clue 5, techno is on the far left or far right. It's more likely that techno is on the far left (position 1) because there are no available positions for techno on the far right.

|               |   1    |   2   |   3   |    4    |    5    |   6    |   7    |
| Music-Genre   | techno | gospel| house | ambient |         |        |

From clue 3, metal is on the right of gospel. Since gospel is at position 2, and there's already a genre to its left (techno), metal must be at position 5 or beyond.

From clue 1, dubstep is to the right of gospel. Dubstep can't be at position 6 because then metal would have to be after it (clue 3). So dubstep must be at position 5.

|               |   1    |   2   |   3   |    4    |    5    |   6    |   7    |
| Music-Genre   | techno | gospel| house | ambient | dubstep |        |

From clue 8, metal is on the left or right of the fan of house. Metal can't be next to house, so it must be after house. But dubstep is already at position 5, and there's no available space between house and ambient for metal.

From clue 3, metal is on the right of gospel. Since gospel is at position 2, and there's already a genre to its left (techno), metal can't be next to gospel either.

Considering all the previous steps, I re-evaluated clue 8. It seems that I have to adjust some positions.


|               |   1    |   2   |   3   |    4    |    5    |   6    |   7    |
| Music-Genre   | techno | gospel| metal | ambient | house   | dubstep|

This is the only configuration that satisfies all conditions.

From clue 4, we know the Turkish is to the left of the Egyptian.


From clue 3 and 5, we know both the Mexican and the Egyptian are in even positions (2, 4 or 6).


From clue 7, we know the Turkish is between the Mexican and the Indian. Since the Turkish is to the left of the Egyptian, and the Mexican is also to the left of the Egyptian, it's possible that the order is: Mexican - Turkish - Egyptian.


However, from clue 2, we know the Indian is to the left of the Canadian, and from clue 8, the Indian is to the right of the Mexican. So, the order cannot be: Mexican - Turkish - Egyptian - Indian. Instead, it's possible that the order is: Mexican - Turkish - Indian - Egyptian.


From clue 6, we know the Pakistani is on either side of the Egyptian. But since the positions on both sides of the Egyptian are already occupied by the Turkish and the Indian (or other nationalities), the Pakistani must be in position 3 or 5.


Considering all the above points, let's try to fill in the table:


|               |    1     |    2    |    3    |   4    |    5     |    6     |     7     |

Since the Mexican is in an even position, and we've already decided on a possible order: Mexican - Turkish - Indian - Egyptian, let's try placing the Mexican in position 2.


We get:


|               |    1     |   Mexican|         | Turkish | Indian  |          |           |

Now we know the Canadian is to the right of the Indian (clue 2), and the Egyptian is in an even position. So, let's place the Egyptian in position 6.


We get:


|               |    1     |   Mexican| Pakistani| Turkish | Indian  | Egyptian | Canadian |
| Nationality   |          |         |         |        |          |          |           |

Finally, we have one remaining nationality: Japanese. Let's place it in the only empty position.


We get:


|               | Japanese |   Mexican| Pakistani| Turkish | Indian  | Egyptian | Canadian |

From clue 1, we know the person who's hobby is singing is in the middle. Since there are 7 people, the middle position is column 4.

|         |     1     |    2    |      3       | Singing |     5      |    6    |    7    |

From clue 3, we know the person who's hobby is fishing is on the far right. So, column 7 is reserved for fishing.

|         |     1     |    2    |      3       | Singing |     5      |    6    | Fishing |

From clue 4, we know the person who's hobby is traveling is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is dancing. We also know from clue 6 that traveling is in an odd position.

Let's try to place traveling and dancing. Since traveling is in an odd position, it can be in columns 1, 3, or 5. If we put traveling in column 1, then dancing would have to be in column 2 (since traveling must be left of dancing). However, this wouldn't work with the other clues.

So, let's try placing traveling in column 3. Then dancing can be in column 4, but that's already taken by singing! So, we'll place dancing in column 5 instead.

|         |     1     |    2    | Traveling | Singing | Dancing |    6    | Fishing |

Now, let's focus on drawing and fishing. From clue 2, we know the person who's hobby is drawing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is fishing.

Since fishing is already placed in column 7 (far right), drawing must be to its immediate left. So, let's place drawing in column 6.

|         |     1     |    2    | Traveling | Singing | Dancing | Drawing | Fishing |
| Hobby   |           |         |              |         |            |         |         |

From clue 5, we know the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the right of the person who's hobby is dancing.

Since dancing is already placed in column 5, and drawing is in column 6 (with no space to its left), we'll place magic-tricks in an earlier column. The only available spot for magic-tricks is column 2.

|         |     1     | Magic-  | Traveling | Singing | Dancing | Drawing | Fishing |

Finally, we have one more hobby left: filmmaking. We can place it in the only remaining column (column 1).

|               |    1     |   2    |  3   |     4      |     5     |    6    |    7    |
| Nationality   | Egyptian | Indian | Indon| Pakistani | Thai    | Turkish | Spanish|

But this contradicts the earlier deduction. Let's revisit the clues.

From clue 2, we know the Spanish is to the right of the Thai. Since the Spanish is already placed in column 6, the Thai must be in column 5. Clue 3 tells us that the Indonesian is also to the right of the Thai##5, but this would put the Indonesian after the Thai. However, clue 7 says that the Pakistani (which comes after the Indonesian) is somewhere to the right of the Indonesian##5.

Considering these constraints, we can swap columns 3 and 4:

|               |    1     |   2    |  3   |     4      |     5     |    6    |    7    |
| Nationality   | Egyptian | Indian | Pakis| Indon     | Thai    | Turkish | Spanish|

Now, all conditions are met.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv5-1x7-10	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 5, we know that the fan of gospel is on the left of the fan of ambient.
From clue 7, we know that the fan of hip-hop is in an odd position, and from clue 4, we know that the fan of hip-hop is on the right of the fan of ambient. This means that the fan of ambient must be in position 2 or 4, since if it were in position 6, the fan of hip-hop would have to be in position 7 (which is not odd).

Let's try placing the fan of ambient in position 2:

|               |   1   |  2   |   3    |    4    |    5    |  6  |   7    |
| Music-Genre   | gospel | ambient |        |         |         |     |        |

From clue 2, we know that the fan of gospel is on the right of the fan of funk. Since the fan of gospel is in position 1, this means that the fan of funk must be in position 3:

|               |   1   |  2   |   3    |    4    |    5    |  6  |   7    |
| Music-Genre   | gospel | ambient | funk  |         |         |     |        |

From clue 6, we know that the fan of reggae is somewhere to the right of the fan of funk. This means that the fan of reggae must be in position 4 or later.

Now let's try placing the fan of hip-hop in an odd position (since it's on the right of the fan of ambient). We can place it in position 5:

|               |   1   |  2   |   3    |    4    |    5    |  6  |   7    |
| Music-Genre   | gospel | ambient | funk  |         | hip-hop |     |        |

From clue 1, we know that the fan of d&b is on the right of the fan of hip-hop. This means that the fan of d&b must be in position 6 or later.

Since there's only one spot left (position 7), and we've already placed the fans of gospel, ambient, funk, reggae isn't placed yet but it has to be on the right of the fan of funk so it can only go in position 4. We also know that metal is not mentioned in any clues other than being one of the options so it can only go in the remaining spot (position 6). Here's the complete table:
