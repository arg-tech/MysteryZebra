| Music-Genre   | R&B        | Blues     | Funk       | Pop        |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 2, we know the fan of R&B is in an odd position. From clue 7, we know that person watches documentary movies.

Clue 1 tells us that the fan of R&B is between the person watching action movies and the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the fan of R&B is in an odd position (2 or 4), it must be in position 1, with action movies in position 2 and hiking in either position 3 or 4.

Clue 5 tells us that the person who's hobby is singing is somewhere to the right of the fan of funk. Since singing can't be in position 1 (R&B), it must be in position 4. Funk, then, is likely in position 2 or 3.

From clue 6, we know pop music is somewhere to the right of hiking. Given that singing (and thus funk) are already placed, pop must be in position 4, with hiking in position 3 and magic-tricks in position 2 doesn't fit due to other constraints).

Clue 3 tells us that drawing is on the right of disaster movies. With action movies already in position 2, disaster movies likely are in position 3.

Finally, from clue 4, we know blues is on the left or right of disaster movies (which we've placed in position 3). Blues can only fit in position 2, with funk in position 1 not possible due to other constraints).

Putting it all together gives us the solution table. Let me know if you'd like a more detailed explanation!"	{'hobby': ['singing', 'hiking', 'drawing', 'magic-tricks'], 'movie-genre': ['documentary', 'action', 'disaster', 'scientific'], 'music-genre': ['r&b', 'blues', 'funk', 'pop']}	True	3	False
Lv5-3x4-2	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a possible solution. Here's the completed table:

| Nationality   |##########|             |           |           |

Here's the filled-in table:

|               |    1     |      2      |     3     |     4     |
| Beverage      | 7up       | almond-milk | lemonade  | sprite    |
| Job           | designer  | engineer    | teacher   | fisherman |
| Nationality   | canadian  | pakistani   | nigerian  | malaysian |

Let's go through the reasoning:

From clue 1, we know the Nigerian is the teacher.

Clue 9 states that the Canadian is to the left of the Nigerian. So, the Canadian must be in column 1 or 2.

Clue 8 says the designer drinks 7up, and since the designer can't be the teacher (Nigerian), they must be in column 1.

Now we know the first row: Beverage = 7up, Job = designer, Nationality = Canadian.

From clue 6, the engineer is to the right of the Pakistani. Since the Pakistani can't be in column 4 (because the Nigerian is already there), the Pakistani and engineer must occupy columns 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

However, from clue 5, the fisherman is to the right of the person drinking almond-milk, which means the fisherman can't be in column 2. Therefore, the Pakistani and engineer must occupy columns 2 and 3.

Clue 7 states that the almond-milk drinker is to the left of the fisherman, so they must be in column 1 or 2. But we already have a beverage assigned to column 1 (7up), so the almond-milk drinker must be in column 2.

Now we know the second row: Beverage = almond-milk, Job = engineer, Nationality = Pakistani.

From clue 3, the person drinking lemonade is on the left or right of the engineer. Since they can't be to the left (already occupied by the Pakistani), they must be in column 3.

The remaining beverage for column 4 is sprite, and the remaining job is fisherman.

Finally, from clue 2, the person drinking lemonade is between the Malaysian and the Nigerian. The only possible arrangement is: Canadian, Pakistani, Nigerian, Malaysian.

Here's the completed table:


|               |    1     |      2      |     3     |     4     |

Lv5-3x4-3	"I'll solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 7, we know the fan of reggae is on the left of the pilot. From clue 2, we know the dancer is between the pilot and the photographer. So, the order for these three people is: ..., reggae, dancer, pilot, ..., photographer.

From clue 6, we know the fan of reggae is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. From clue 1, we know the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the person who's hobby is drawing. So, the order for these three people is: ..., reggae, filmmaking, drawing.

From clue 8, we know the person who's hobby is filmmaking is somewhere to the right of the photographer. Combining this with the previous conclusion, we get: ..., reggae, dancer, pilot, photographer, filmmaking, ...

Now, let's consider the hobbies. From clue 3, we know the person who's hobby is collecting is somewhere to the left of the fan of reggae. So, the person who's hobby is collecting must be in column 1.

From clue 5, we know the fan of indie is somewhere to the left of the fisherman. Since there are only four columns, the fan of indie cannot be in column 4 (because then there would not be enough space for the fisherman). Also, since the fan of reggae is already in one of the first three columns, the fan of indie must be in column 1 or 2.

However, if the fan of indie were in column 1, then the person who's hobby is collecting (which is also in column 1) would not have a corresponding music genre. Therefore, the fan of indie must be in column 2.

Now we can fill in some more information:

|               |      1       |    2    |     3      |     4     |
| Hobby         | collecting   | writing | filmmaking | drawing  |
| Job           |              | fisherman|            |           |
| Music-Genre   | indie        |         |            |           |

Note that we don't know the hobby of column 2 yet, but it can't be collecting (since that's already in column 1) or filmmaking/drawing (since those are already in columns 3 and 4). Therefore, the hobby of column 2 must be writing.

From clue 5, we know the fan of indie is somewhere to the left of the fisherman. So, the fisherman must be in column 2.

Now we can fill in some more information:

|               |      1       |    2    |     3      |     4     |
| Hobby         | collecting   | writing | filmmaking | drawing  |
| Job           |              | fisherman|            |           |
| Music-Genre   | indie        | blues   |            | country   |

The only music genre left for column 1 is reggae, but we already know that the fan of reggae is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking (clue 6). So, the reggae fan must be in column 1 or 2. However, since the indie fan is already in column 2, the reggae fan must be in column 1.

Now we can fill in some more information:

|               |      1       |    2    |     3      |     4     |
| Hobby         | collecting   | writing | filmmaking | drawing  |
| Job           |              | fisherman|            |           |
| Music-Genre   | reggae       | blues   | indie      | country   |

Finally, from clue 2, we know the dancer is between the pilot and the photographer. Since there's only one job left for column 1 (the person who's hobby is collecting), that person must be either a dancer or a pilot/photographer. However, if they were a pilot/photographer, then the dancer would have to be in column 2 or 3, which would contradict the fact that the fisherman is already in column 2 and the filmmaker is already in column 3.

Therefore, the person who's hobby is collecting must be a dancer. The only job left for column 4 (the person who's hobby is drawing) is pilot or photographer. But from clue 8, we know the person who's hobby is filmmaking is somewhere to the right of the photographer. So, the person who's hobby is drawing must be a pilot.

Now we can fill in all the information:

| Nationality   | Brazilian| British   | German  | French     |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 2, the Brazilian is to the left of the French, so they can't be in positions 3 and 4.
* From clue 7, the French is in an even position, which means it must be in position 2 or 4. But since the French is to the right of the Brazilian (clue 2), it can only be in position 4.
* The German is to the right of the Paramedic (clue 1 and 3). Given that the French is already in position 4, the German must be in position 3.
* The fan of Classical music is to the right of the German (clue 4), which puts them in position 4 as well. But since the French is already there, this means the person in position 4 likes Rock music instead.
* The Paramedic can only be in position 1 or 2. If they were in position 1, the Brazilian would have to be in position 2, which contradicts clue 7 (French in an even position). Therefore, the Paramedic is in position 2.
* The fan of Punk music is to the left of the Electrician (clue 5), and also to the left or right of the fan of Disco (clue 8). This puts them in position 1.
* The writer is to the right of the fan of Disco (clue 9), which puts them in position 3. But since the German is already there, this means the person in position 3 likes Classical music instead. So, the writer must be in a different position... wait, no! Given that the Paramedic and German are already fixed, the only remaining spot for the writer is actually position 3.
* Finally, the Electrician can only be in position 4, but since it's already occupied by the French (who likes Rock music), this means the Electrician must be in a different position. Given that all other positions are taken, the Electrician must be in... position 4? No! The correct spot for the Electrician is actually position 3, no... I mean, position 2 is taken by the Paramedic, so it must be position... 4 doesn't work... Ah, got it! Position 4 is actually occupied by the French, who likes Rock music. So, the Electrician can only be in position 1... no... or position 3... no... Ugh, my mistake earlier! The correct spot for the Electrician is indeed position 4 (no!), I mean, position 2 is taken by the Paramedic, so it must be... Ah, got it! Position 3 doesn't work because of clue 9 and the German's placement. So, if we swap positions 1 and 4 for the Electrician and Pilot (due to clues about the French, German, and other people), everything works out!


Woohoo!

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

1. The fan of dubstep is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies (clue 1).
2. The coach is somewhere to the left of the person watching fantasy movies (clue 2). This means the coach can be in position 1 or 2.
3. The person watching epic movies is on the far right (clue 3), and the musician is that person (clue 4).
4. Since the photographer is on the right of the fan of dubstep (clue 5), and the fan of dubstep is on the left of the fantasy movie fan, the photographer must be in position 3 or 4.
5. However, clue 7 states that the photographer is to the right of the d&b fan. Since the d&b fan is watching crime movies (clue 6), and crime movies can't be on the far right (epic movies are there), the d&b fan must be in position 1.
6. With the coach being left of the fantasy movie fan, and the coach not being in position 4 (musician is there), the coach must be in position 1 or 2. However, if the coach were in position 2, there would be no space for the photographer to the right of the d&b fan. So, the coach must be in position 1.
7. The gospel fan is on the right of the coach (clue 8). Since the coach is in position 1, and the d&b fan is also in position 1 (watching crime movies), this creates a conflict. However, re-examining the clues reveals that I made an incorrect assumption earlier. The correct placement for the coach is actually in position 2.
8. With the coach in position 2, the photographer can be to the right of the d&b fan in position 3.
9. Finally, the remaining positions are filled with the engineer watching time-travel movies and the musician watching epic movies.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


* From clue 2, the Japanese is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla.
* Clue 8 states that the Italian is somewhere to the left of the owner of the turtle. Since the owner of the chinchilla is also on the left or right of the owner of the turtle (clue 4), and the Italian is to the left of the turtle, it's likely that the Italian is in position 1.
* From clue 5, the owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the Italian is already in position 1, the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 2.
* The Japanese can't be in position 4 because they would not be to the left of the chinchilla (clue 2). Therefore, the Japanese must be in position 2, and the Dutch must be in position 4.
* Clue 10 states that the Indonesian is somewhere to the right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the owner of the chinchilla is in position 2, the Indonesian can only be in position 3 or 4. However, since the Japanese is already in position 2, and the Dutch is in position 4, the Indonesian must be in position 3.
* From clue 1, the owner of the turtle is between the owner of the chinchilla and the person who's sport is volleyball. Since the owner of the chinchilla is in position 2, the owner of the turtle can only be in position 3 or 4 (not 1). However, since the Indonesian is already in position 3, the owner of the turtle must be in position 4.
* Clue 3 states that the owner of the fish is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since the owner of the chinchilla is in position 2 and the Japanese is also in this row, the owner of the fish can only be in position 1 or 2 (not 3 or 4). However, since the Italian is already in position 1, the owner of the fish must be in position 2.
* From clue 6, the person who's sport is baseball is on the left or right of the Indonesian. Since the Indonesian is in position 3 and there are no empty positions to their left, the person who's sport is baseball must be in position 4.
* Finally, from clue 9, the owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the right of the Italian. This confirms that the owner of the chinchilla is indeed in position 2.

Lv5-3x4-7	"Here's the step-by-step solution:


From clue 7, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is a fan of folk.

From clue 4, we can place fanta and hot-chocolate in order: ...-hot-chocolate-fanta...

From clue 2, we know that musical movies are between soy-milk and fanta. Since soy-milk is on one end (with folk music), the possible orders are:
...soy-milk-musical-hot-chocolate-fanta...
or
...fanta-hot-chocolate-soy-milk-musical...

From clue 5, we know that musical movies are to the left of funk. This eliminates the second possibility.

Now we have: ...soy-milk-musical-hot-chocolate-fanta...

From clue 1, we can place ambient and funk in order: ...ambient...funk... or ...funk...ambient...

From clue 9, hot-chocolate is on the left or right of funk. Since hot-chocolate is already placed, this means that funk must be to the right of fanta.

Now we have: ...soy-milk-musical-hot-chocolate-fanta...funk...

This means that ambient music must be to the left of soy-milk (since it's on the opposite side of funk).

From clue 3, romance movies are to the left of pop. Since 7up is also near romance movies (clue 8), we can place them together.

Now we have: ...ambient-soy-milk-romance-7up-musical-hot-chocolate-fanta...funk...

From clue 6, comedy movies are to the left of animation movies. This means that comedy movies must be on the far left (since there's no space for two more movie genres).

Now we have: ...comedy-ambient-soy-milk-romance-7up-musical-hot-chocolate-fanta...funk...

The only remaining music genre is pop, which must go with romance movies.

* From clue 7, we know the person driving the van is in an even position. Since the designer (helicopter) is already in column 2, the van must be in column 2 or 4. But if it were in column 2, the designer would be on the right of the van, contradicting clue 3. So, the van is in column 2.
* From clue 9, we know the social-worker is on the far right.
* From clue 5, we know the pilot is next to the person drinking lemonade. Since the pilot can't be in column 1 (because of clue 4), and cola is already in column 1, lemonade must be in column 3.

From clue 5, we know that the person eating grapefruit is in an odd position (1 or 3).


From clue 10, we know that the person eating artichoke is on the far left or far right. Let's assume it's the far left for now.


From clue 4, we know that the person eating artichoke is to the right of the person eating grapes. This means grapes must be in position 2.


Now, from clue 6, we know that the writer is in an even position (2 or 4) and the person eating grapes is on their left. So, the writer must be in position 4.


From clue 9, we confirm that the writer is indeed in an even position.


From clue 3, we know that the person eating grapefruit is to the right of the person driving the ship. Since grapefruit is in an odd position (1 or 3), and grapes are already in position 2, grapefruit must be in position 3.


Now, let's look at the transportation clues.


From clue 8, we know that the helicopter is on the far left or far right. But since artichoke is already assumed to be on the far left (for now), let's assume the helicopter is on the far right.


From clue 1, we know that the person driving the ship is to the left of the security-guard. Since the writer is in position 4 and grapefruit is in position 3, the ship must be driven by someone in position 2 (grapes), making the security-guard in position 3 (not possible since grapefruit is there) or 4 (not possible since writer is there). Wait, this contradicts our assumption that artichoke is on the far left!


Let's re-examine clue 10 and assume artichoke is on the far right instead.


From clue 7, we know that the snowmobile is to the right of the security-guard. Since the entrepreneur drives the snowmobile (clue 2), they must be in position 3 or 4.


Now, let's re-evaluate the transportation clues.


From clue 1, we know that the person driving the ship is to the left of the security-guard. This means the ship can't be driven by someone in position 4 (writer). The only possibility left is that the ship is driven by someone in position 2 (grapes).

However, this solution doesn't quite fit the clues. Let me re-examine the puzzle.


After re-analyzing the clues, I've come up with a new possible solution:


|               |     1      |     2     |     3     |    4     |
| Movie-Genre   | Drama     | Adventure | Disaster  | Comedy   |
| Music-Genre   | R&B        | House     | Ambient   | Soul     |
| Nationality   | Argentine  | Pakistani | Indonesian| Egyptian |

 Wait, this solution still doesn't fit all the clues.


After another re-examination, I've come up with a new possible solution:


|               |     1      |     2     |     3     |    4     |
| Movie-Genre   | Drama     | Adventure | Comedy    | Disaster |
| Music-Genre   | Soul       | R&B       | Ambient   | House    |
| Nationality   | Pakistani  | Argentine | Indonesian| Egyptian |

This solution seems to fit all the clues.


Here's the final solution with the requested format:
