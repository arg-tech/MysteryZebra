Lv5-4x4-1	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a possible solution:


|               |     1      |    2     |   3   |    4     |
| Food          | Papaya    | Apple    | Banana | Cucumber |
| Music-Genre   | R&B        | Electronic| Blues  | House    |
| Pet           | Goat       | Bird     | Cat    | Turtle   |
| Transport     | Airplane   | Bike     | Bus    | Ship     |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:


From clues (1) and (5), we can deduce that the person driving the bike is in column 2, and the person eating banana is in column 3.

Clue (7) tells us that the airplane is either to the left or right of the electronic fan. Since the electronic fan is already in column 2, the airplane must be in column 1.

From clue (11), we know the ship is somewhere to the right of papaya, which means papaya is in column 1.

Clue (3) tells us that the owner of the bird is on the right of the person driving the ship. This implies that the bird's owner is in either column 2 or 3.

From clue (4), we know the cat's owner is on the right of the blues fan, so they can't be together in columns 1 and 2. Given this constraint, it's more likely that the blues fan is in column 3.

Now, let's look at clue (9). If R&B is either to the left or right of Blues, and considering our current layout, R&B must be in column 1.

With R&B in column 1 and House somewhere to their right (clue 8), it makes sense for House to be in column 4.

This forces Cucumber into column 4 as well (from clue 2).

Finally, looking at clue (10), we see that the turtle's owner must be on the right of the goat's owner. This means the goat is likely in column 1 or 2, and the turtle is in either column 3 or 4. Given our current setup, it fits better to put the goat in column 1 and the turtle in column 4.

Combining all these steps, we arrive at the solution above.

| Transport     | Skateboard | Car         | Roller  | Scooter      |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 6, the skateboard can be on either side. But from clue 7, crime is between mystery and cola, so the skateboard must be on the left to allow for this configuration.
* Clue 11 places the car next to the person drinking iced-tea, which in turn puts the dog's owner (clue 9) at position 3.
* The frog's owner (clue 2) is now at an odd position, specifically position 4.
* Clues 8 and 10 place the goldfish's owner next to almond-milk and cola, respectively. This can only happen if the goldfish's owner is at position 2.
* With the goldfish's owner at position 2, the roller must be at position 3 (clue 8), which in turn puts the bird at position 4 (to avoid conflict with clue 9).
* The martial-arts fan (clue 1) takes the remaining spot on the right.
* Finally, clues 5 and 11 confirm the positions of iced-tea, dog, car, and cola.

Please note that this is just one possible solution. If you'd like me to walk through each step or provide more explanations, I'd be happy to do so.

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* Clue 10: The owner of the turtle is on the left of the person eating apricot, so the turtle must be in position 2.
* Clue 6: The owner of the turtle is between the fan of techno and the fan of rock. Since the turtle is in position 2, the fan of techno must be in position 3 or 4, and the fan of rock must be in position 1.
* Clue 5: The person eating plum is on the left of the person eating apricot, so the plum must be in position 4.
* Clue 9: The owner of the dog is in an even position, so the dog must be in position 2 or 4. But since the turtle is already in position 2, the dog must be in position 4.
* Clue 11: The person watching martial-arts movies is the owner of the dog, so the martial-arts movie fan is also in position 4.
* Clue 1: The person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the person watching adventure movies, so the adventure movie fan must be in position 3 or 1. But since the rock music fan is already in position 1, the adventure movie fan must be in position 1, and the horror movie fan can go in position 3.
* Clue 12: The person watching adventure movies is somewhere to the left of the person eating pumpkin, so the pumpkin must be in position 2 or 3. But since the turtle is already in position 2, the pumpkin must be in position 1.

#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* Clue 8 states that the musician is on the far left, so that fixes the first column.
* From clue 13, we know the fan of metal is somewhere to the left of the firefighter. Since the musician is already in column 1, the fan of metal must be in column 2.
* Clue 7 tells us that the person drinking mirinda is between the fan of metal and the person drinking sprite. This means mirinda must be in column 3.
* From clue 12, we know the person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Therefore, almond-milk must be in column 1 (next to the musician).
* Clue 9 states that the person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the fan of pop. Since mirinda is already in column 3, the fan of pop must be either in column 2 or 4.
* Clue 6 tells us that the fan of metal is on the left or right of the fan of reggae. We already have metal in column 2, so reggae must be in either column 1 or 3.
* However, clue 2 states that the fan of reggae is to the left of the writer. Since we don't know where the writer is yet, let's come back to this later.
* Clue 4 tells us that the person who's sport is handball is somewhere to the right of the person drinking mirinda. Therefore, handball must be in column 3 or 4.
* From clue 3, we know the person who's sport is handball is on the left or right of the police-officer. This means handball cannot be in column 1 (since police-officer would have to be in an impossible position). Therefore, handball must be in column 3, and police-officer must be in either column 2 or 4.
* Clue 5 states that the person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola. Since we already know cola is not in column 1 (almond-milk), baseball must be in column 2, and cola must be in column 3 or 4.
* However, clue 10 tells us that the person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola. This means cola cannot be in column 4 (since sprite would have to be in an impossible position). Therefore, cola must be in column 3, and sprite must be in column 4.
* Now we can revisit clue 2, which states that the fan of reggae is to the left of the writer. Since we already know metal is in column 2, reggae must be in column 1 (next to the musician).
* Clue 11 tells us that the fan of pop is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis. We already have handball and baseball fixed, so tennis must be in either column 1 or 2. However, since reggae is already in column 1, tennis must be in column 2.
* Finally, we can fill in the remaining blanks:
	+ The fan of pop must be in column 4 (next to sprite).
	+ The firefighter must be in column 4 (since police-officer is in column 3, and clue 13 states that metal is to the left of firefighter).
	+ Lacrosse must be in column 2 (the only remaining sport).

| Nationality   | nigerian          | colombian  | indonesian| egyptian |


Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 5, we know the person drinking water is eating plum. From clue 6, we know the person drinking tea is on the right of the person eating plum. So, the person drinking water and eating plum must be in position 3 or 4.


From clue 1, we know the journalist is between the person drinking coffee and the person eating plum. Since the person eating plum is also drinking water (clue 5), this means the journalist must be in position 2, and the person drinking coffee must be in position 1 or 3.


From clue 4, we know the software-developer is somewhere to the left of the person drinking tea. This means the software-developer cannot be in position 4 (since there's no one to their right). Also, from clue 7, we know the person eating peach is on the left or right of the software-developer.


From clue 9, we know the chef is somewhere to the right of the person eating peach. This means the chef cannot be in position 1 or 2 (since there's no one to their left). Also, from clue 7, we know the person eating peach is on the left or right of the software-developer.


From clue 10, we know the person eating papaya is on the far left or far right. Since the person eating plum is drinking water and cannot be in position 1 (due to clue 12), this means the person eating papaya must be in position 1.


From clue 11, we know the person eating papaya is on the left or right of the indonesian. This means the indonesian must be in position 2 or 3. However, from clue 2, we know the indonesian is somewhere to the left of the person eating grapes. Since the person eating plum (position 4) cannot eat grapes, this means the person eating grapes must be in position 4.


From clue 8, we know the nigerian is on the left or right of the fisherman. This means the nigerian and fisherman must be adjacent to each other. From clue 13, we know the nigerian is somewhere to the left of the person drinking tea. Since the person drinking tea cannot be in position 1 (due to clue 6), this means the person drinking tea must be in position 4.


From clue 3, we know the egyptian is in an odd position. This means the egyptian must be in position 1 or 3. However, from clue 11, we know the indonesian is on the left or right of the person eating papaya (position 1). Therefore, the egyptian must be in position 3.


Now that we have most of the positions filled in, we can deduce the remaining information:


The colombian must be in position 2 since it's the only nationality left. The journalist is also in position 2 due to clue 1.


The chef must be in position 4 since it's the only job left and there's no one to their right (due to clue 9).

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* From clue 12, we know that cabbage is in an even position. Since there are only two even positions (2 and 4), and lime is already mentioned in several other clues, it's more likely that cabbage is in position 2.
* Clue 9 tells us that the fan of dubstep eats cabbage, so the music-genre for position 2 is dubstep.
* Clue 10 says that the fan of hip-hop is to the left of the fan of d&b. Since we already have dubstep in position 2, it's likely that hip-hop is in position 1.
* From clue 8, we know that the fan of salsa is to the left of the fan of d&b. Given that hip-hop is already in position 1, salsa must be in position 3.
* Clue 7 tells us that the fan of d&b is to the right of the person driving the scooter. Since motorbike is mentioned in several other clues, it's more likely that the scooter is in position 1.
* Clue 5 says that the person watching thriller movies is to the left of the fan of dubstep. Given that musical is already associated with jet-ski (clue 3), it's likely that thriller is in position 4.
* From clue 11, we know that action is to the left of thriller, so action must be in position 1.
* Clue 6 says that salsa is its own fan, but this doesn't provide any new information.
* With the food, movie-genre, and music-genre mostly filled out, we can use clues 1-4 to determine the transport modes. Motorbike is to the left of jet-ski (clue 4), and motorbike is to the right of lime (clue 1). Given that lime is already in position 3, motorbike must be in position 3 as well.
* Finally, clue 3 tells us that jet-ski is between musical movies and cucumber. Since motorbike is already in position 3, jet-ski must be in position 4.

Lv5-4x4-10	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a possible solution:


|               |       1        |      2       |     3     |     4      |
| Beverage      |   water       |    7up       | cola      | iced-tea  |
| Hobby         | woodworking   | magic-tricks | collecting| reading    |
| Job           | police-officer| paramedic    | fisherman | entrepreneur|
| Music-Genre   | gospel        | d&b          | country   | r&b        |

Let me explain my thought process:

From clue 5, we know the entrepreneur is a fan of r&b.
From clue 11, we know the fan of r&b (the entrepreneur) is to the left of the fisherman.

Now, let's look at clue 1: the fan of country is on the left or right of the fisherman. Since the entrepreneur (fan of r&b) is already to the left of the fisherman, the fan of country must be to the right of the fisherman.

From clue 6, we know the fan of gospel is between the person drinking iced-tea and the paramedic. This means the fan of gospel cannot be in position 1 or 4 (since there's no one on the other side).

Now, let's look at clues 3 and 7: the person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is reading. Since there are only two positions available for these hobbies (positions 1 and 2), we can conclude that the person with the hobby woodworking must be in position 1, and the person with the hobby reading must be in position 4.

From clue 9, we know the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left or right of the fan of r&b. Since the entrepreneur (fan of r&b) is already in position 4, the person with the hobby magic-tricks must be in position 2 or 3.

Now, let's look at clue 8: the entrepreneur is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. This means the person with the hobby magic-tricks cannot be in position 4 (since there's no one on the other side).

We can now conclude that the person with the hobby magic-tricks must be in position 2, and the entrepreneur (fan of r&b) must be in position 4.

From clue 10, we know the person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the fan of gospel. Since the fan of gospel cannot be in position 1 or 4, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 3 or 4.

Finally, from clue 2 and 5, we can conclude that the person who's hobby is collecting is in position 3, and the fisherman is in position 3 as well.


So, here is the solution:


|               |       1        |      2       |     3     |     4      |
| Beverage      |   water       |    7up       | cola      | iced-tea  |
| Hobby         | woodworking   | magic-tricks | collecting| reading    |
| Job           | police-officer| paramedic    | fisherman | entrepreneur|
| Music-Genre   | gospel        | d&b          | country   | r&b        |
