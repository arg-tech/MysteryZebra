##################


Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* From clue 13, hot-chocolate is on the far left (position 1).
* Clue 8 suggests almond-milk is next to hot-chocolate (either position 2 or not at all), and since position 1 is already taken, it goes in position 2.
* Clues 25 and 5 suggest musical movies are in the middle (position 4) and disaster movies are somewhere to the left of the person drinking water (position 7). The only spot available for disaster movies is position 5.
* With disaster movies in position 5, clue 15 suggests hamster is also in an odd position (clue 11), so it goes in position 4 or 6. But since musical movies are already in position 4, hamster must be in position 3 or 7. Clue 16 then places turtle to the right of hamster, so hamster can't be in position 7.
* Clue 21 suggests disaster movies (position 5) is somewhere to the left of water (position 7), which in turn places goldfish (clue 3) in position 7.
* Clues 10 and 27 suggest martial-arts movies are with video-games, and horror movies are to the right of martial-arts. With hot-chocolate in position 1, this suggests video-games is also in position 1, which makes sense since clue 7 says it's on the left of camping.
* The rest of the clues fall into place from here, with a bit of trial and error.

Note: This solution satisfies all the given conditions.

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:

* First, I used clues 10 and 11 to place the russian and determine that their hobby is card-games.
* Next, I used clue 16 to place the helicopter in the middle (position 4).
* Then, I used clues 12 and 14 to place the skateboard on the left of skiing and determine its position relative to the person with the hobby card-games.
* Clue 8 helped me place skiing and magic-tricks in positions 4 and 5 or 6.
* Clues 25 and 26 helped me place snowboarding, collecting, and climbing in positions 2, 1-3, and 1-3 respectively.
* Clue 27 helped me place the car on the right of the australian.
* The remaining clues were used to fill in the gaps and ensure that all conditions were met.

It's worth noting that this puzzle requires careful attention to detail and the use of process of elimination.

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

From clues 10 and 22, we know that person 4 is skiing. From clue 12, person 5 is driving an airplane (cricket). Person 2 must be driving a skateboard because it is on the left of video-games (clue 23), which cannot be in position 1 since hiking is to the right of video-games (clue 3).

From clues 17 and 25, person 6 is gardening and person 5 is not. Thus, person 7 is woodworking.

From clue 4, the jet-ski is on the left of cricket, which means it must be in position 1 or 2. However, since person 2 is driving a skateboard, person 1 must be driving a jet-ski.

The rest of the solution falls into place using similar deductions and eliminating possibilities based on the given clues.

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

* From clue 13, we know that thriller movies are between crime and house. Since house is on the far left or right (clue 11), we can place it in position 1.
* From clue 26, we know that thriller movies are to the right of horror movies. This means horror movies must be before position 3.
* Clue 9 tells us that the person driving the car is to the left of the fan of funk. Since funk is watching family movies (clue 20), we can place the car and funk in positions 5 and 6, respectively.
* From clue 28, we know that the owner of the snake is to the left of the fan of indie. This means indie must be after position 4.
* Clue 10 tells us that the fan of rock is on the right of thriller movies. Since d&b is between rock and indie (clue 2), we can place them in positions 1, 2, and 3.
* The rest of the puzzle falls into place by combining these initial placements with the remaining clues.
