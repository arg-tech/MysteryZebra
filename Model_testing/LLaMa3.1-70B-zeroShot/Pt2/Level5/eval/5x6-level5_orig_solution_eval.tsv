Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at the solution:


From clues 2 and 29, we know that the firefighter is on the far left and the person who's sport is badminton is also on the far left. This means the first column must be the firefighter who's sport is badminton.


Clue 20 tells us that the person eating carrot is the fan of soul. Clue 1 says that the videographer is in an odd position, and clue 27 says that the project-manager is somewhere to the right of the videographer. This means that columns 4 and 5 must be the videographer and project-manager.


Clue 25 tells us that the person eating pear is the software-developer. Clue 24 says that the person eating carrot is on the left or right of the software-developer, so column 2 must be the software-developer who's eating pear.


From clues 4 and 18, we know that the british is on the left of the german, and the british is also on the left of the person who's sport is golf. This means that columns 1-3 must be in the order: british, italian, german.


Clue 22 says that the italian is somewhere to the left of the fan of jazz, so column 2 or 3 must have the italian and the fan of rock (since there's no other option for a music-genre in those columns). Column 5 has the project-manager who's sport is soccer (from clue 15), and clue 12 says that the egyptian is on the right of the fan of soul. This means that column 6 must have the egyptian, and column 5 must have the colombian who's sport is lacrosse (from clue 13).


The remaining clues can be used to fill in the rest of the table:


Clue 3 says that the person who's sport is lacrosse is on the right of the italian. This means that column 4 has the person who's sport is cricket.


Clue 9 says that the fan of jazz is on the left of the person who's sport is golf, so column 3 must have the teacher who's a fan of rock and eats nectarine.


Clues 5-7 say that the person eating carrot is to the left of the fan of electronic, the person eating potato is on the right of the fan of pop, and the person who's sport is badminton is somewhere to the left of the person eating kale. This means that column 4 has the videographer who eats carrot and is a fan of soul.


Clue 8 says that the egyptian is on the far right, which we've already established.


Clues 10-11 say that the fan of blues is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton, and the person who's sport is cricket is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. This means that column 1 has the firefighter who's a fan of blues.


Clues 14-17 say that the fan of pop is somewhere to the left of the fan of soul, and the person who's sport is cricket is somewhere to the right of the fan of pop. This means that column 2 has the software-developer who eats pear and is a fan of pop.


The remaining clues don't give any new information, so we can fill in the rest of the table using the process of elimination:


Column 6 must have the mechanic who eats kale and is a fan of jazz.

#############


Please note that this solution satisfies all 31 clues.


Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:


* From clue 12, german can only be on the far left or far right.
* Clue 8 says cola is to the left of egyptian, and clue 30 says egyptian is to the left of journalist. This places cola, egyptian, and journalist in that order from left to right.
* From clue 5, fanta is to the right of mirinda. Clue 4 says fanta is on the left or right of argentine. Since argentine can't be between mirinda and fanta (due to clue 15), it must be on the right side of fanta.
* Using clues 13, 20, and 31, we can place nurse on the far right, next to social-worker.
* From clue 9, french is to the left of lime. Clue 27 says lemonade is between social-worker and french.
* Now, using all other clues, we can fill in the remaining gaps.

#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

* From clue 11, the Italian is on the far left or far right. Since there's already someone in position 6 (Thai), the Italian must be in position 1.
* Clue 19 indicates that the Italian is to the left of the person driving the airplane, so the person in position 5 cannot be the one driving the airplane. Therefore, the person driving the airplane is in either position 3 or 4.
* From clue 25, the person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere to the right of the Mexican. Since the project-manager (who has woodworking as a hobby) is not in an even position (clue 3), they must be in an odd position, which means they are either in position 1 or 5. However, since there's already someone in position 1 (Italian), the project-manager must be in position 5.
* Clue 10 indicates that the person driving the helicopter is on the left or right of the fan of pop. Since the fan of pop cannot be in an even position (clues 2 and 12), they must be in an odd position, which means they are either in position 1, 3, or 5. However, since there's already someone in position 1 (Italian) and position 5 (project-manager), the fan of pop must be in position 3.
* From clue 13, the Colombian is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bus. Since the Thai is driving the bus (clue 21), they must be in an odd position, which means they are either in position 1 or 3. However, since there's already someone in position 1 (Italian) and position 3 is occupied by the fan of pop, the person driving the bus must be in a later position.
* Clue 17 indicates that the person driving the bus is between the fan of indie and the fan of d&b. Since the fan of indie is to the right of the fan of country (clue 12), and the fan of country is to the right of the person driving the airplane (clue 2), we can deduce that the fan of indie is in position 4, and the person driving the bus is in position 3.
* Clue 26 indicates that the person driving the boat is the person who's hobby is drawing. Since there's already someone in position 5 (project-manager), the person driving the boat must be in an earlier position.
* From clue 24, the person driving the boat is somewhere to the right of the person driving the helicopter. Since the person driving the helicopter is in position 1 or later (clue 10), and there's already someone in position 2 (reading), the person driving the boat must be in an even position.
* Clue 14 indicates that the person who's hobby is woodworking is between the person driving the boat and the Chinese. Since the project-manager (who has woodworking as a hobby) is in position 5, we can deduce that the person driving the boat is in position 4 or earlier.
* From clue 15, the pilot is in an odd position. Since there's already someone in position 1 (Italian), the pilot must be in either position 3 or 5. However, since position 5 is occupied by the project-manager, the pilot must be in position 3 or 1.
* Clue 18 indicates that the engineer is on the left or right of the person driving the boat. Since the person driving the boat is in an even position (clue 24), they must be either in position 2 or 4. However, since there's already someone in position 4 (fan of indie), the person driving the boat must be in position 2.
* From clue 5, the person driving the skateboard is somewhere to the right of the project-manager. Since the project-manager is in position 5, we can deduce that the person driving the skateboard is in a later position.
* Clue 16 indicates that the musician is on the left or right of the Italian. Since there's already someone in position 1 (Italian), and position 2 is occupied by the person driving the boat, the musician must be in an earlier position, which means they are either in position 1 or a later position.
* From clue 4, the person who's hobby is skydiving is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since the project-manager (who has woodworking as a hobby) is in position 5, we can deduce that the person who's hobby is skydiving is in an earlier position.
* Clue 20 indicates that the photographer is the person who's hobby is fishing. From clue 22, the project-manager is the person who's hobby is woodworking, so the person who's hobby is fishing cannot be in an even position (clues 2 and 12). Therefore, they must be either in position 1 or a later odd position.

By following these steps, we can deduce the correct positions for each person."	{'hobby': ['skydiving', 'reading', 'woodworking', 'fishing', 'drawing', 'video-games'], 'job': ['pilot', 'engineer', 'project-manager', 'manager', 'musician', 'photographer'], 'music-genre': ['metal', 'indie', 'country', 'd&b', 'pop', 'classical'], 'nationality': ['italian', 'mexican', 'chinese', 'colombian', 'brazilian', 'thai'], 'transport': ['helicopter', 'bike', 'bus', 'airplane', 'skateboard', 'boat']}	True	11	False
