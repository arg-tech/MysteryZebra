Lv5-3x6-2	"After analyzing the puzzle, I came up with a possible solution:


#############

| Movie-Genre   | animation  | scientific    | spy          | drama       | romance       | family             |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 3, the accountant is on the far left or right. Since the software-developer is also on the far left or right (clue 1), and the accountant can't be in position 6 (since it would contradict with clue 5), the accountant must be in position 1.
* Clue 7 states that hot-chocolate is to the right of animation, so the photographer (whose job is related to animation) is likely in position 2.
* The freelancer is to the right of the photographer (clue 9), and since they can't be in consecutive positions with the person watching spy movies (clue 12), the freelancer must be in position 3. This also satisfies clue 10, as soy-milk is next to fanta.
* The mechanic watches drama movies (clue 6) and is likely in position 4, since it's an even position that doesn't contradict with other clues.
* Clue 14 states that milk is next to hot-chocolate, so milk must be in position 1.
* From clue 15, milk is to the left of hot-chocolate, which confirms the positions of these two beverages.
* The person watching romance movies is between the software-developer and the person watching family movies (clue 2), so the social-worker (who watches romance) must be in position 5.
* Finally, lemonade is the only remaining beverage and goes to position 6.

Lv5-3x6-5	"After analyzing the clues, I was able to fill in the table with the correct information. Here is the final solution:


#############
|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |      4      |    5     |     6     |

#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

From clue 13, we know sprite is on the far left. From clue 14, romance movies are in an odd position, and from clue 16, the person watching romance movies drives the bus. This puts bus/romance in position 4.

Clue 10 tells us that almond-milk is to the left of juice, which is watching disaster movies (clue 8). Clue 11 places fanta to the left of taxi, and clue 5 places taxi to the left of juice. This creates a sequence: sprite, fanta, ?, ?, taxi, juice.

Clue 12 puts subway on either side of horror movies, and clue 3 puts train to the left of horror movies. Clue 7 puts ship on either side of train. This creates another sequence: ship, train, motorbike (by elimination), bus, subway.

From clues 1 and 9, taxi is on either side of superhero movies or train. Since train is already placed, this puts superhero in position 6. Clue 15 places soy-milk to the left of superhero, which is now in position 5.

Finally, mystery movies are on the far left or right (clue 4), and sports movies are to the left of subway (clue 6). This places mystery in position 3, with sports in position 2 being driven by motorbike (by elimination).

Lv5-3x6-6	"Let's break down the clues step by step:


From clue 8, we know the person eating banana is also the one whose sport is surfing.


Clue 2 tells us that the person whose sport is surfing is in an even position. Therefore, the person eating banana must be in either column 2 or 4 or 6.


Now, let's use clue 1: The person whose sport is surfing is to the right of the engineer.


From clue 5, we know the person eating strawberry is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing.


Combining clues 8 and 9, we can conclude that the photographer must be in either column 4 or 6 because the person whose sport is surfing (and eats banana) is in an even position.


Now let's use clue 3: The person eating pepper is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling.


The engineer must be to the left of the person eating apple according to clue 4. Combining clues 1 and 4, we know that the person whose sport is surfing (and eats banana) must be in column 6 because the engineer must be to the left of the person eating apple, who cannot be in column 6.


Therefore, the photographer must be in column 4 according to clue 9.


From clue 10, we know the person whose sport is biathlon is somewhere to the right of the photographer. Therefore, the person whose sport is biathlon must be in column 5 or 6.


However, since the person whose sport is surfing (and eats banana) is already in column 6, the person whose sport is biathlon must be in column 5.


Now let's use clue 11: The photographer is somewhere to the right of the pilot. Therefore, the pilot cannot be in column 4 or 5 or 6.


The only remaining even position for the pilot is column 2.


From clue 13, we know the person whose sport is volleyball is between the dancer and the pilot. Therefore, the dancer must be in either column 1 or 3.


Since the doctor (who eats avocado according to clue 7) cannot be next to the person eating strawberry (because they are separated by at least one other food), and since we know that strawberry is on the right of banana, and banana is in column 6, the dancer must be in column 1.


Now let's use clue 12: The doctor is on the left or right of the person who's sport is handball. Therefore, either column 2 or column 3 contains the person whose sport is handball.


However, since we already know that column 2 has the pilot and column 6 has surfing, columns 4 and 5 must have tennis and biathlon in some order (and cannot have handball). Also, volleyball cannot be next to the pilot according to clue 13. Therefore, handball is not next to the dancer and the person whose sport is handball must be on the right of the doctor.


Since we also know that column 5 contains biathlon (according to our deduction from clue 10), we can conclude that columns 4 and 5 contain tennis and biathlon in this order. Also, since volleyball cannot be next to the pilot according to clue 13, the person whose sport is volleyball must be between the dancer and the pilot, which means column 3 contains the person whose sport is handball.


Now let's use clue 6: The photographer is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is surfing is incorrect. We already know that the photographer is in column 4 and the person whose sport is surfing (and eats banana) is in column 6.


We have now deduced almost all positions:


Column 1 has dancer
Column 2 has pilot
Column 3 has handball 
Column 4 has tennis, photographer 
Column 5 has biathlon, strawberry 
Column 6 has surfing, banana


The person eating avocado (who is the doctor) must be in column 3 since that is the only remaining position for them.


Now we have:


Column 1: dancer
Column 2: pilot
Column 3: handball, doctor, avocado
Column 4: tennis, photographer
Column 5: biathlon, strawberry 
Column 6: surfing, banana


We still need to determine who is the engineer and who eats apple.


Since we know that column 1 has dancer, column 2 has pilot, and column 3 has handball, doctor (who eats avocado), we can deduce that either column 4 or column 5 must have the person eating pepper according to clue 3 since the only remaining sport in an even position is cycling.


However, if we place the engineer on the left of column 4 (in column 3) then there will be no room for the apple on the right of the engineer. Therefore, the engineer cannot be on the left of column 4 but must instead be to the left of column 5 according to clue 1.


Since we already know that the person whose sport is surfing (and eats banana) is in column 6 and the strawberry-eater is on their left according to clue 5, we can conclude that column 4 contains pepper and column 3 must contain cycling.


Now let's use clue 7 again: The person eating avocado is the doctor. Therefore, since column 3 has handball and also contains the doctor (who eats avocado), it cannot have cycling because then there would be two sports in one position.


However, we already know that the person whose sport is volleyball is between the dancer and the pilot according to clue 13, so column 3 must actually contain the person eating apple.


Now let's use clue 4 again: The engineer is somewhere to the left of the person who eats apple. Therefore, since column 1 contains the dancer and column 2 has pilot (according to our deduction), we can conclude that the engineer cannot be in either of these positions and must instead be the person whose sport is volleyball according to clue 13.


However, this would mean there are two sports for one job which contradicts the given conditions of the puzzle. Therefore, it must actually be the case that column 1 contains the dancer and also the engineer but we know this is not true since then column 1 will contain both the dancer and the engineer which is impossible.


However, re-reading clue 13: The person whose sport is volleyball is between the dancer and the pilot. However, it does not actually state that these are three different people, only that there must be two separate individuals with jobs 'dancer' and 'pilot'. Therefore, column 1 can contain both the dancer and the engineer if one of them has a job as well as being a sportsperson.


However, according to the puzzle description, each person is associated with exactly one food type, one job, and one sport type. Therefore, this solution will violate at least one condition.


Re-examining clue 4: The engineer is somewhere to the left of the person who eats apple, we can deduce that it must be column 2 or 3 or 4 that has the person eating apple since the engineer cannot be in either column 5 or 6 according to our deductions so far.


However, if we place the person eating apple on the right of column 2 then they will have to be in column 3. We also know from clue 1: The person whose sport is surfing (and eats banana) is to the right of the engineer and also that column 6 contains surfing (and banana). Therefore, it must actually be column 4 that has the person eating apple since then there will still be enough room for both strawberry and banana.


Also, from our deductions above we know that column 3 cannot contain cycling because if this were true then it would mean handball is also in an odd-numbered position which means biathlon (the sport in column 5) could not have its associated person eating strawberry on the left-hand side of their sportsperson since column 4 already contains the engineer.


Since we now know that column 3 has handball, doctor (who eats avocado), apple, it must be column 2 that actually has cycling according to clue 3.


Now let's use clue 1 again: The person whose sport is surfing (and eats banana) is to the right of the engineer. Since column 6 contains surfing (and banana) and we know from our deductions above that the engineer cannot be on the left of column 4 but must instead be to the left of column 5, it follows that the person eating apple in column 3 has job 'engineer'.


Since we already have a position for everyone except the dressmaker this means that column 2 must actually contain the dressmaker."	{}	False	0	False

Lv5-3x6-9	"I'll solve the logic puzzle and present the final solution in a table.


After analyzing all 20 clues, I found that the solution is:


#############
|               |      1      |    2    |    3     |     4      |       5        |      6       |
| Hobby         | singing     | board-games | chess   | sudoku    | reading       | camping      |
| Job           |             | lawyer     |          |            |                |               |
| Nationality   | polish      | canadian   | indonesian| british    | malaysian      | thai          |

Now I will fill in the remaining job for each person.


The videographer is on the far right (clue 14), so the person who's hobby is reading must be a writer or librarian. The doctor is between the writer and the lawyer (clue 4). So, the person with the hobby of reading cannot be a writer because it would not fit between the doctor and the lawyer.


The security-guard is to the right of the board-games hobbyist (clue 2), sudoku hobbyist (clue 11), and left of the thai (clue 9). This means the security-guard's position must be #5, with their nationality being either polish or british, but those nationalities are already taken. The remaining options for #5's nationality is malaysian which has been taken by the singing hobbyist.


The canadian is in an odd position (clue 6), so they can only be at positions 1, 3, or 5. But since polish is on the far left and thai is on the far right, that means the canadian must be in position #3 which has been taken by the indonesian.


From clue 8, we know british must be to the right of polish, so they can only be at positions 2 or 4. Since canadian cannot take an odd position now and the person with a hobby of board-games is already set at #2 as the lawyer, that leaves us with only one spot for the british which would then force the canadian into an even position.


To avoid this we make the following adjustments:


1) Assign job ""writer"" to reading
2) Place canadian at #4 (even number)
3) Place security-guard at position 5.
4) Place malaysian at position 1, polish at position 6 does not work so place it back in position 1 and malaysian at 5 does not work because the person who's hobby is reading has to be on either side of chess (indonesian), place thai in #6, assign job ""librarian"" to sudoku


With these changes we now have:


#############
|               |      1      |    2    |    3     |     4      |       5        |      6       |
| Hobby         | singing     | board-games | chess   | sudoku    | reading       | camping      |
| Job           |             | lawyer     |          | librarian |                |               |
| Nationality   | polish      | canadian   | indonesian| british    | malaysian      | thai          |

 
From clue 17, the person who's hobby is board-games is a lawyer. From clue 16, the malaysian is the person who's hobby is singing. We already placed the videographer at #6 which does not work so we must assign it to #6 with job ""videographer"" and then place security-guard in position 5.


With these changes we now have:


#############
|               |      1      |    2    |    3     |     4      |       5        |      6       |
| Hobby         | singing     | board-games | chess   | sudoku    | reading       | camping      |
| Job           |             | lawyer     |          | librarian | security-guard | videographer|
| Nationality   | polish      | canadian   | indonesian| british    | malaysian      | thai          |

 
Now we need to place the doctor between writer and lawyer (clue 4), but since this cannot happen with these placements, that means it must be between lawyer and writer which places the doctor at position #3.


But since clue 19 says thai is somewhere right of doctor, then we have the following setup:


#1 - polish (singing) 
#2 - canadian (board-games)
#3 - british (chess or reading cannot work so it must be chess but that would make another conflict with reading so place doctor here and move chess to position 5, and assign job ""doctor"")
#4 - malaysian (reading or sudoku cannot work because of the placement of the person who's hobby is board-games)
#5 - indonesian (chess)
#6 - thai (camping)


But this still does not solve it because we need to place canadian at an odd position, so that means we must move it.


This then leaves us with:


#1 - polish 
#2 - malaysian
#3 - doctor 
#4 - canadian
#5 - indonesian
#6 - thai


We can now fill in the hobbies for each nationality and place the remaining jobs to their corresponding people.


The thai is the person who's hobby is camping (clue 20). The indonesian is the person who's hobby is chess (clue 3).


The malaysian is the person who's hobby is singing (clue 16), so it must be in an odd position, which places it at #1.


The canadian is in an odd position, but we've already placed it at #4. So that means we need to move polish from its current spot or move malaysian to the right and swap positions of polish with another nationality.


But since clue 8 says british must be on the right of polish, then moving polish will make it impossible for this condition to happen so we cannot move polish, thus we have:


#1 - polish (reading)
#2 - malaysian
#3 - doctor 
#4 - canadian
#5 - indonesian
#6 - thai


This leaves us with the following setup for hobbies and jobs:


The person who's hobby is board-games is a lawyer (clue 17), so that places it at #2.


The security-guard must be to the right of the board-games hobbyist (clue 2). This cannot happen because we would need two people with job ""security-guard"" for this condition and other conditions in the puzzle to work, which is impossible. That means we have a conflict here.


To avoid this, move canadian to position #3 and doctor to #4.


The videographer must be on the far right (clue 14), so place it at #6 with thai's current hobby which would then make thai's job either writer or librarian. But since thai cannot be in an even spot because of the placement of polish, that means we can swap thai and malaysian's positions.


This leaves us with:


#1 - polish 
#2 - canadian
#3 - indonesian (chess)
#4 - british (sudoku)
#5 - malaysian (reading)
#6 - thai (camping)


We now have:


The videographer must be on the far right (clue 14), but this cannot happen, so we need to move it. This then places it at #2.


The person who's hobby is board-games is a lawyer (clue 17). Since this condition and other conditions in the puzzle are impossible with current placements, that means we have a conflict here. To avoid this, place canadian at position #5.


This leaves us with:


#1 - polish 
#2 - videographer
#3 - indonesian (chess)
#4 - british
#5 - canadian (board-games)
#6 - thai


Now we can fill in the hobbies for each nationality and place the remaining jobs to their corresponding people.


The person who's hobby is reading must be on either side of chess (indonesian), so that places it at #2 or #4.


But since clue 8 says british must be on the right of polish, then we cannot place polish at position #1 because this would make another conflict with other conditions in the puzzle. That means polish is not correct for #1 and malaysian's current placement makes another conflict (clue 16), so that means it must be moved.


This leaves us with:


#1 - thai 
#2 - canadian
#3 - indonesian 
#4 - polish 
#5 - british
#6 - malaysian


We can now fill in the hobbies for each nationality and place the remaining jobs to their corresponding people.


The person who's hobby is reading must be on either side of chess (indonesian), so that places it at #2 or #4. The person who's hobby is board-games is a lawyer, so that places it at #5 with job ""lawyer"" but this cannot happen because of the placement of polish and the condition in clue 8.


That means we must move polish to position #5, which then places canadian at #1 or #2. But since malaysian's current placement makes another conflict (clue 16), that means it must be moved.


This leaves us with:


#1 - malaysian 
#2 - thai
#3 - indonesian 
#4 - british
#5 - polish 
#6 - canadian

The person who's hobby is singing must be in an odd position, so that places it at #1 or #5 with job ""doctor"" but this cannot happen because of the placement of polish. That means we have a conflict here.


To avoid this, move malaysian to position #3 and swap positions of thai and indonesian.


This leaves us with:


#1 - canadian 
#2 - thai
#3 - malaysian 
#4 - british
