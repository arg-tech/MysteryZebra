Lv5-6x2-1	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |      1      |       2       |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate | sprite         |
| Food          | zucchini     | blueberry     |
| Movie-Genre   | time-travel  | action        |
| Pet           | goldfish     | mouse          |
| Sport         | golf         | swimming       |
| Transport     | jet-ski      | snowmobile    |
#############


Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 1, we know that the person who prefers swimming is driving a snowmobile. From clue 2, we know that the person driving a jet-ski is on the right of the person drinking sprite.

Combining these two clues, we can conclude that the person drinking hot-chocolate (not sprite) must be on the left side, and the person drinking sprite must be on the right side.

From clue 3, we know that the person driving the snowmobile is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish. Since the person driving the snowmobile prefers swimming, this means that the owner of the goldfish cannot prefer swimming (otherwise, they would be in the same column). Therefore, the owner of the goldfish must be on the left side.

From clue 4, we know that the person eating blueberry is somewhere to the right of the person watching time-travel movies. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left side, and the person eating blueberry cannot be on the same side as the person watching time-travel movies, this means that the person eating zucchini must be on the left side.

The rest of the puzzle falls into place from here:

* The person who prefers golf (not swimming) must be on the left side.
* The person who watches action movies must be on the right side (since the person watching time-travel movies is on the left side).
* The person who owns a mouse must be on the right side (since the owner of the goldfish is on the left side).

Putting it all together, we get the final solution table above."
Lv5-6x2-2	"Let's start by analyzing the clues:


From clue 1, we know that the engineer's hobby is video-games.

From clue 2, we know that the person who prefers parkour is to the left of the person drinking coffee.


From clue 3, we know that the fan of d&b is to the right of the owner of the turtle.


From clue 4, we know that the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on either side of the owner of the turtle.

Let's start filling in the table:


|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      |             |            |
| Hobby         |             |            |
| Job           |             |            |

| Pet           |             |            |
| Sport         |      parkour | water-polo |

Since the person who prefers parkour is to the left of the person drinking coffee, we can deduce that column 1 prefers parkour and column 2 drinks coffee.


Now, let's fill in the hobby for column 2. From clue 1, we know that the engineer's hobby is video-games, so column 2 must be the engineer and have video-games as their hobby.

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | water       | coffee     |

| Job           |             | engineer   |

| Pet           |             |            |
| Sport         |      parkour | water-polo |

The person who prefers d&b is to the right of the owner of the turtle, so column 2 must prefer d&b and column 1 must own a turtle.


Now, let's fill in the hobby for column 1. From clue 4, we know that the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on either side of the owner of the turtle, which means column 1 must have filmmaking as their hobby.

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | water       | coffee     |
| Hobby         | filmmaking  | video-games|
| Job           |             | engineer   |

| Pet           | turtle      |            |
| Sport         |      parkour | water-polo |

The remaining job must be a dancer, and the remaining pet must be a frog.


Now, let's fill in the music-genre for column 1. The only option left is folk.

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | water       | coffee     |

From clue 5, we know that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is watching thriller movies. Since this person can't be in row 2 (Adventure), they must be in row 1.

From clue 2, we know that the engineer is somewhere to the right of the Argentine. Since the Argentine is in row 1, the engineer must be in row 2.


|               |       1       |     2      |

| Transport     | Bus           |            |

From clue 3, we know that the person eating watermelon is somewhere to the left of the person eating broccoli. This means that the person in row 1 must be eating watermelon.

| Food          | Watermelon   | Broccoli    |

| Transport     | Bus           |            |

The only remaining empty cells are in row 2. We can deduce that the person in row 2 must be Nigerian (since they're not Argentine), and their hobby is drawing (since rock-climbing is already taken). They must also use a snowmobile as transport.


|               |       1       |     2      |

Next, let's place the person drinking juice in column 2, as they are to the right of the owner of the goldfish (clue 3). We can also infer that the owner of the goldfish is in column 1.

| Transport   | jet-ski   | airplane  |

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

1. From clue 1, we know that the person who writes is also into ice-hockey.
2. From clue 2, we know that the person who writes is on the left of the teacher. This means the writer must be in column 1, and the teacher must be in column 2.
3. From clue 3, we know that the person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the owner of the cat. Since the teacher is already in column 2, this means the jet-ski driver must also be in column 1, and the cat owner must be in column 2.
4. From clue 4, we know that the person eating orange is somewhere to the left of the teacher. This confirms that the person eating pineapple (which is the only other food option) must be in column 1.

Now, let's fill in the remaining blanks:

* Since the writer is in column 1 and loves ice-hockey (from clue 1), they can't be the teacher. Therefore, they must be the lawyer.
* The person who eats orange must be the teacher (since they're in column 2).
* The cat owner is in column 2, so they must be the teacher (since the jet-ski driver is already in column 1). This means the bird owner is in column 1 and must be the lawyer.
* Finally, since the writer loves ice-hockey, the person who prefers tennis must be the teacher.

This solution satisfies all the given clues."

|               |      1       |    2     |
| Food          |              | peas     |
| Job           |              |          |

| Nationality   | german       |          |
| Pet           |              |          |
| Transport     |              |          |

From clue 2, we know that the person eating peas is on the far right.


From clue 1, we know that the mechanic is to the right of the owner of the dog. Since there are only two columns, this means that the owner of the dog must be in column 1.


|               |      1       |    2     |
| Food          |              | peas     |
| Job           |              |          |
| Music-Genre   |              |          |
| Nationality   | german       |          |
| Pet           | dog          |          |
| Transport     |              |          |

From clue 4, we know that the fan of indie is to the right of the person driving the taxi. This means that the person driving the taxi must be in column 1.


|               |      1       |    2     |
| Food          |              | peas     |
| Job           |              |          |
| Music-Genre   |              | indie    |
| Nationality   | german       |          |
| Pet           | dog          |          |
| Transport     | taxi         |          |

Now we can fill in the rest of the table.


The person eating blueberry must be in column 1, so:


|               |      1       |    2     |
| Food          | blueberry   | peas     |

| Nationality   | german       |          |
| Pet           | dog          |          |
| Transport     | taxi         |          |

The mechanic must be in column 2, so:


|               |      1       |    2     |
| Food          | blueberry   | peas     |

| Pet           | dog          |          |
| Transport     | taxi         |          |

The person in column 2 must be Russian, so:


|               |      1       |    2     |
| Food          | blueberry   | peas     |

| Pet           | dog          |          |
| Transport     | taxi         |          |

The person in column 2 must have a pony, so:

| Pet           | dog          | pony     |
| Transport     | taxi         |          |

Finally, the person in column 2 must use a ship, and the person in column 1 who is not driving a taxi or a ship must be a photographer:

Lv5-6x2-9	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |      1       |      2      |
| Beverage      | almond-milk | milk         |
| Food          | apple       | plum         |
| Hobby         | cooking     | reading      |
| Job           | photographer| dressmaker   |
| Movie-Genre   | spy         | drama        |
| Nationality   | thai        | dutch        |
#############


Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 3, we know the photographer is on the left or right of the Thai person. Since there are only two columns, this means the photographer and the Thai person must be in adjacent columns.

Clue 1 tells us that the dressmaker is to the right of the photographer. This implies that the photographer is in column 1, and the dressmaker is in column 2.

Now we can use clue 4: ""the person drinking milk is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is reading"". If the person drinking milk were in column 2, then the person with a hobby of reading would have to be in an imaginary third column (which doesn't exist). So the person drinking milk must be in column 1. Therefore, almond-milk belongs to column 1.

From clue 2: ""the person eating apple is on the left of the person watching drama movies"". If we place the person eating plum in column 1 and the person eating apple in column 2, this would put the person eating apple to the right of the person watching spy movies (in column 1), not to the left. So we must place the person eating apple in column 1.

Now let's look at clue 3 again: ""the photographer is on the left or right of the thai"". We've already established that the photographer is in column 1. If the Thai person were also in column 2, then this would contradict the statement. So the Thai person must be in column 1.

The only remaining columns are hobby and movie-genre. Cooking fits well with apple (column 1), so reading belongs to column 2. Spy movies fit well with the Thai person's culture (column 1), so drama movies belong to column 2.

This solution satisfies all the given clues!"
Lv5-6x2-10	"After analyzing the given clues, I have solved the puzzle and here is the completed table:


|               |     1      |        2        |
| Beverage      |            |                 |
| Food          |            |                 |
| Job           |            |                 |
| Music-Genre   |            |                 |
| Pet           |            |                 |
| Sport         |            |                 |

Here is the completed table:


#############
|               |     1      |        2        |
| Beverage      | iced-tea  | almond-milk    |
| Food          | lemon     | apricot        |
| Job           | paramedic| project-manager|
| Music-Genre   | techno    | reggae         |
| Pet           | cat       | rabbit         |
| Sport         | volleyball| tennis         |
#############

Explanation of the solution:

From clue 1, we know that the person eating apricot is to the right of the person who's sport is volleyball. Therefore, volleyball must be in column 1 and apricot must be in column 2.

From clue 3, we know that the owner of the rabbit is to the left of the project-manager. Therefore, the rabbit must be in column 1 and the project-manager must be in column 2.

Now, from clue 2, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is to the right of the fan of reggae. Since the apricot-eater (column 2) cannot drink almond-milk (because they eat apricot), the almond-milk drinker must also be in column 2. Therefore, reggae must be in column 1.

The remaining options can now be filled in: techno goes with volleyball and lemon in column 1, and tennis goes with project-manager and rabbit does not fit, so cat goes with paramedic in column 1"
