Lv5-5x2-1	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a possible solution:


|            |       1       |         2          |
| Beverage   | water        | lemonade           |
| Hobby      | skydiving    | hiking             |
| Job        | software-developer | analyst          |
| Pet        | hedgehog     | dog                |
| Sport      | skateboarding| rugby              |


Let's break down the reasoning:


1. The software-developer is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade.
This means the software-developer can't be in the middle, so it must be either on the left (column 1) or right (column 2). Since clue #2 states that the software-developer is to the right of the skydiving enthusiast, it's more likely that the software-developer is in column 1.


2. The software-developer is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
This means the software-developer must be in column 1, and the skydiving enthusiast must be to its left (but since there are only two columns, this isn't possible). Therefore, the skydiving enthusiast must be in column 2. However, we already placed the software-developer in column 1. To satisfy both clues #1 and #2, we need to swap the positions of the hobbies. So, the skydiving enthusiast is actually in column 1.


3. The owner of the dog is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
This means the person with the dog must be either in the same column as the skateboarder or in the next column to the right (column 2). Since there are only two columns, we can place the skateboarder in column 1 and the dog owner in column 2.


Putting it all together:


|            |       1       |         2          |
| Beverage   | water        | lemonade           |
| Hobby      | skydiving    | hiking             |
| Job        | software-developer | analyst          |
| Pet        | hedgehog     | dog                |
| Sport      | skateboarding| rugby              |

So, the final solution is:

Lv5-5x2-2	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|            |     1     |       2       |
| Beverage   | water    | lemonade      |
| Food       | potato   | apricot       |
| Job        | scientist| fisherman     |
| Pet        | hedgehog | turtle        |
| Sport      | cycling   | skateboarding|
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 1, we know that the person who enjoys cycling is in an odd position, which means they must be in column 1.

From clue 2, we know that the person drinking lemonade is to the right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since there are only two columns, this means the hedgehog's owner must be in column 1, and the lemonade drinker must be in column 2.

From clue 3, we know that the fisherman is on the right of the scientist. This implies that the scientist must be in column 1, and the fisherman must be in column 2.

From clue 4, we know that the person eating potato is somewhere to the left of the person drinking lemonade. Since the lemonade drinker is already determined to be in column 2, this means the potato eater must be in column 1.

Putting it all together, we can fill in the remaining blanks:

* The scientist (column 1) eats potato and owns a hedgehog.
* The fisherman (column 2) drinks lemonade and eats apricot.
* The person who enjoys cycling is the same as the one eating potato and owning a hedgehog (column 1).
* The person who enjoys skateboarding must be the remaining combination, which is column 2.

The final solution table should match the above arrangement."
Lv5-5x2-3	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step.

From clue 1, we know that the person drinking Sprite is on the left of the Chinese person. Let's place the Chinese person in column 2 for now:

|               |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage      | Sprite    |          |
| Movie-Genre   |            |           |
| Nationality   |            | Chinese  |
| Sport         |            |           |
| Transport     |            |           |

From clue 3, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is watching mystery movies. Let's fill in the transport and movie-genre columns:

|               |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage      | Sprite    |          |
| Movie-Genre   | Mystery   |           |
| Nationality   |            | Chinese  |
| Sport         |            |           |
| Transport     | Quad-bike |           |

From clue 2, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is to the right of the person who's sport is skiing. Since the quad-bike is already in column 1, the person who likes skiing must be in a non-existent column to the left. However, this is not possible, so the person who likes skiing must be in column 2. Let's fill in the sport column:

|               |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage      | Sprite    |          |
| Movie-Genre   | Mystery   |           |
| Nationality   |            | Chinese  |
| Sport         |            | Skiing  |
| Transport     | Quad-bike |           |

Now we can fill in the remaining columns. The person who likes mystery movies is already in column 1, so the person who likes scientific movies must be in column 2. The person who drinks 7up must be in column 2, since Sprite is already in column 1. Finally, the nationality of the person in column 1 must be Russian.

Here's the completed table:

#############

| Sport       | Golf       | Biathlon      |
| Transport   | Skateboard | Quad-bike     |
#############


Here's how I arrived at this solution:

1. From clue 1, we know the person eating carrot is to the right of the person eating cherry. This means Cherry must be on the left (column 1).
2. From clue 2, we know the skateboard rider is to the left of the security-guard. Since the security-guard can't be on column 1 (Cherry's spot), they must be on column 2. Therefore, the skateboard rider is on column 1.
3. From clue 3, we know the cooking hobbyist is to the right of the biathlon sport enthusiast. Since Cooking and Biathlon can't both be on column 1, Biathlon must be on column 1 (left) and Cooking on column 2 (right).

Putting these pieces together:

* Cherry is on column 1.
* Skateboard rider is also on column 1.
* Security-guard is on column 2.
* Biathlon enthusiast is on column 1 (since Cooking is to their right).
* Golf must be the remaining sport, which goes on column 1 with Skateboard and Biathlon.

Now we can fill in the remaining spots:


Firefighter and Quad-bike go together on column 2.

| Transport     | Boat      | Train           |

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 2, we know the designer drives a boat, so Job 1 is Designer and Transport 1 is Boat.
* From clue 3, we know the Indian is to the right of the fan of Funk. Since there are only two people, this means the Indian must be person 2, and the fan of Funk is person 1 (Music-Genre 1).
* Clue 1 states that the person driving the train is to the right of the person who's sport is tennis. This means Sport 1 is Tennis, and Transport 2 is Train.
* From clue 3, we also know the Indian (person 2) must be somewhere to the right of the fan of Funk (person 1), so Nationality 2 is German doesn't fit. Therefore, Nationality 1 is Indian and Nationality 2 is German.
* The only remaining option for Music-Genre 2 is Soul.

| Nationality   | egyptian    | polish            |
#################


Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 3, we know the Egyptian is a fan of house music. From clue 1, we know the Egyptian is to the left of the software developer.

From clue 2, we know the person watching spy movies is to the left of the person eating pepper. Since the Egyptian is already placed on the left, and they can't eat pepper (because the clue mentions two different types of food), the person watching spy movies must be the Egyptian.

Now, let's fill in the rest:

* The firefighter job is likely paired with the Egyptian, as it seems like a more ""action-oriented"" profession.
* The person eating pepper must be on the right, so they're likely the software developer (as per clue 1).
* Since the person watching spy movies is already the Egyptian, the person on the right must watch mystery movies.

The music genres can now be filled in: the Egyptian likes house, and the other person likes country.

Finally, we know there are two nationalities: Egyptian and Polish. The Polish nationality must belong to the person on the right (software developer).

2. The person eating peas is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster: Since peas can't be in the middle (there's no ""3"" column), this means that peas and hamster must be together, with pea-eater being one of them.
3. The person watching zombie movies is somewhere to the left of the person eating potato: This implies that zombie movie fan must be on the left, and since tea can't be on the left (because of clue 1), milk must be the beverage for this person.
