First, let's start with the far left and far right positions:


From clue 10, the fan of techno is on the far left.

Now, let's analyze the clues:


From clue 1, the project-manager is the person who's hobby is gardening.


From clue 6, the person who's hobby is gardening is somewhere to the left of the security-guard.


From clue 13, the person who's hobby is singing is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening.


So, we have:

From clue 4, the person eating strawberry is on the left or right of the french.


From clue 16, the french is in an even position.


Let's place the french in position 2:

Now, strawberry can be either in position 1 or 3.

So, strawberry must be in position 1:


strawberry (techno) | french | gardening | singing | ? | kiwi | woodworking

#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

* From clue 32, the fan of folk is on the far left.
* From clue 4, the person driving the bike is the fan of hip-hop, so they are in position 2.
* From clue 33, the fan of hip-hop is on the left of the fan of rock, so the fan of rock is in position 3.
* From clue 1, the italian is on the left of the person who's sport is water-polo, and from clue 6, the italian is on the right of the person driving the airplane. So, the italian is in position 3, and the person driving the airplane is in position 1.
* From clue 11, the fan of rock is on the left or right of the italian, so the fan of rock must be in position 2 or 4. But from clue 8, the fan of metal is somewhere to the left of the fan of indie, and from clue 19, the fan of indie is on the left or right of the person who's sport is water-polo. Therefore, the fan of rock cannot be in position 2, so they must be in position 4.
* From clue 5, the brazilian is the brazilian, but we don't know their position yet.
