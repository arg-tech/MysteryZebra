| Nationality   | argentine | colombian| chinese            | japanese  |
| Sport         | rowing    | cycling  | parkour            | swimming  |
| Transport     | bus       | scooter  | trike              | jet-ski   |

Here is the explanation of how I solved it:

From clue 14, we know that the person watching sports movies is on the far left. From clue 5, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the lawyer.

Combining these two clues with clue 4, we can deduce that the lawyer must be in position 1, and the person watching sports movies is also in position 1. 

From clue 16, we know that the chef is driving a trike. From clue 2, we know that the chef is in an even position. Therefore, the chef must be in position 3 or 4.

However, from clue 15, we know that the person who's sport is parkour is on the left of the person driving the trike. This means the chef cannot be in position 4, as there would not be enough space for the person watching martial-arts movies and the person eating peas (clue 13).

So, the chef must be in position 2.

Now we can start filling in some other values:

* From clue 10, the person drinking milk is on the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the software-developer is driving a jet-ski (clue 3), and the chef is in position 2, the person drinking milk must be in position 1 or 3.
* However, from clue 12, we know that the person drinking milk is somewhere to the right of the person driving the trike. This means the person drinking milk cannot be in position 1, so it must be in position 3.

We can now fill in more values:

* From clue 11, the colombian is between the person drinking almond-milk and the person driving the scooter.
* Since the person watching sports movies is on the far left (clue 14), we know that the chinese is somewhere to the right of the person watching sports movies (clue 20).
* The argentine must be in position 1, since it's the only remaining space for a nationality.

Now we can make some further deductions:

* From clue 8, the person eating cucumber is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since the person watching sports movies is in position 1 and cannot drink iced-tea (clue 4), the person eating cucumber must be in position 2.
* From clue 19, we know that the person eating cucumber is somewhere to the right of the person eating onion. This means the person eating onion must be in position 1.

Finally, we can fill in the remaining values:

* The person drinking water must be in position 4, as all other beverages have been assigned.
* From clue 17, we know that the argentine is on the left of the person eating orange. Therefore, the person eating orange must be in position 2 or 4. However, since the colombian is between the person drinking almond-milk and the person driving the scooter (clue 11), we can deduce that the colombian must be in position 2.
* The only remaining movie-genre for position 1 is martial-arts.

| Sport         | lacrosse  | surfing       | rowing      | basketball     |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:


* From clue 1, lemonade is on the far left.
* Clue 2 and 6 imply that basketball is on the far right.
* Clue 3 implies that the nurse is to the left of polish. Since there are no other nationalities between them, they must be in columns 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.
* Clue 5 implies that the nurse is to the left of hot-chocolate, so hot-chocolate can't be in column 1 or 2 (since lemonade is already in column 1).
* Clue 7 implies that woodworking is comedy movies.
* Clue 8 implies that gardening is to the right of puzzles.
* Clue 9 implies that family movies are to the right of dutch.
* Clue 10 implies that pakistani is next to analyst (either left or right).
* Clue 11 implies that surfing is to the right of lacrosse.
* Clue 12 implies that rowing is to the right of hot-chocolate, which means hot-chocolate must be in column 3, and rowing in column 4.
* Clue 13 implies that lettuce is to the left of puzzles.
* Clue 14 implies that librarian is next to potato (either left or right).
* Clue 15 implies that lettuce is to the left of woodworking.
* Clue 16 implies that water is next to woodworking (either left or right).
* Clue 17 implies that malaysian is next to mirinda (either left or right).
* Clue 18 implies that gardening is between tomato and woodworking.


By combining these clues, we can deduce the solution above."

| Transport     | car       | helicopter  | ship       | van      |

The reasoning behind the solution is as follows:

* From clue 10, the person eating potato is on the far right.
* From clue 6, the person eating potato is the italian.
* From clue 19 (which is identical to clue 1), the person drinking water is on the left or right of the italian. Since the italian is on the far right, the person drinking water must be in position 3 or not existent (since there is no one to the right of position 4). However, from clue 17, we know that the person eating kale is the person drinking water.
* From clue 5, the person drinking 7up is on the right of the person eating kale. Therefore, the person drinking 7up must be in position 2 or not existent (since there is no one to the right of position 4). However, since we already have a person drinking water in position 1 or 3, and another beverage in position 4, the person drinking 7up must be in position 2.
* From clue 11, the person driving the van is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing. Therefore, the person driving the van cannot be in position 1 (since there is no one to their left).
* From clue 15, the person driving the van is somewhere to the right of the person watching scientific movies. Therefore, the person watching scientific movies must be in a lower-numbered position than the person driving the van.
* From clue 13, the scientist is in an odd position. Since there are only two odd positions (1 and 3), the scientist must be in one of those positions.
* From clue 12, the argentine is somewhere to the right of the scientist. Therefore, the argentine cannot be in position 1 (since there is no one to their left).
* From clue 16, the person who's sport is cycling is somewhere to the left of the argentine. Therefore, the person who's sport is cycling must be in a lower-numbered position than the argentine.
* From clue 3, the person drinking almond-milk is between the person who's sport is soccer and the person drinking fanta. Since we already have a person drinking water in position 1 or 3, and another beverage in position 2, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 2.
* From clue 4, the person who's sport is soccer is on the left or right of the person eating blueberry. Therefore, the person eating blueberry cannot be in position 1 (since there is no one to their left).
* From clue 8, the person watching musical movies is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water. Therefore, the person watching musical movies must be in a higher-numbered position than the person drinking water.
* From clue 9, the person driving the ship is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water. Therefore, the person driving the ship must be in a higher-numbered position than the person drinking water.

By combining all these clues and doing some trial-and-error, I came up with the final solution table.

#############


Please note that this is one possible solution, and there might be other valid solutions as well.


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 14, we know the person driving the trike is to the right of the person driving the airplane. Clue 13 states the chef is to the right of the person driving the trike, so the chef must be in position 3.


Clue 11 tells us the fan of hip-hop is Indonesian, and clue 5 says the person eating carrot is a fan of hip-hop. From clue 2, we know the Russian is to the right of the person drinking fanta. Clue 19 states the person drinking iced-tea is to the right of the person driving the airplane.


Clue 10 places the owner of the mouse between the person driving the airplane and the fan of reggae (clue 1). The social-worker must be next to the owner of the mouse (clue 7).


With these pieces in place, we can start filling in the other rows:


* From clue 8, we know the owner of the rat drinks cola.
* Clue 16 places the person eating spinach next to the fan of gospel. Since the fan of reggae is to the left of the person eating spinach (clue 3), and the fan of reggae is also to the left of the person drinking iced-tea (clue 6), we can conclude that the person eating spinach drinks sprite.
* Clue 18 tells us the analyst is Mexican, so they must be in position 1.


Using these clues as a starting point, I've tried to fill in the remaining rows while satisfying all the given conditions. The resulting table should meet all the requirements specified in the puzzle."
Lv5-7x4-9	"After solving the puzzle, I arrived at the following solution:

| Transport     | motorbike | trike       | bus         | ship         |

 
Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* From clues 1 and 3, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is also the person who drives the bus and has baking as their hobby.
* Clue 16 tells us that the fan of indie music is on the far left. Since clue 13 says that the fan of indie is in an odd position, they must be in position 1 or 3. However, clue 18 states that the person drinking fanta is on the far left or far right, so the fan of indie must be in position 1.
* Clue 2 tells us that the person eating eggplant is to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since the firefighter is to the right of the fan of techno (clue 12), and the fan of indie is on the far left, the person eating eggplant must be in position 3.
* Clue 7 tells us that the person drinking water is to the left of the teacher. Since the person who's hobby is board-games drinks water (clue 10) and is in an even position (clue 17), they must be in position 2.
* Clue 4 states that the musician is to the left of the person eating eggplant, so the musician must be in position 2 or 3. However, since the person drinking water is in position 2, the musician must be in position 4 (but this would put them after the person eating eggplant, which contradicts clue 4). Therefore, the musician must actually be in position 3, and the person eating eggplant must be in position 4.
* Clue 6 states that the person watching thriller movies is on the far right. Since clue 11 says that the fan of rock is to the left of the person watching fantasy movies, and the fan of rock is in an even position (clue 5), the person watching thriller movies must be in position 4.
* Clue 19 tells us that the person drinking lemonade watches satire movies. Since clue 15 says that the person watching satire movies is on the far left or far right, and the fan of indie is already on the far left, the person watching satire movies must be in position 3. However, this would put them to the left of the person eating eggplant (who is actually in position 4), so instead the person watching satire movies must be in position 1 or 2. But if they were in position 2, the person drinking water would have to watch thriller movies (which contradicts clue 7). Therefore, the person watching satire movies must be in position 3 is incorrect and must actually be in position 1.
* Clue 20 tells us that the bus is between the trike and broccoli. Since the fan of indie is already on the far left (in position 1), and the person drinking water is in position 2, the bus must be in either position 3 or 4. However, since the firefighter is to the right of the fan of techno (clue 12), and the fan of indie is on the far left, the bus must actually be in position 3.
* From here, we can fill in the remaining blanks using the given clues.

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:


1. Clue 4 and clue 10 allowed me to place the person watching fantasy movies (who is also the writer) in position 3.
2. Clue 5 placed the security-guard on the left of the person who's sport is surfing, which put the security-guard in position 2.
3. Clue 19 confirmed that the security-guard is the fan of trance.
4. Clue 7 and clue 10 allowed me to place the person whose hobby is writing (the writer) in position 3 or 4, but since they are already in position 3, this helped to confirm their placement.
5. Clues 2 and 13 placed the person watching martial-arts movies (who is also driving the ship) on the left of the person driving the taxi, which put them in position 1.
6. Clue 14 placed the person watching time-travel movies on the far right, which put them in position 4.
7. Clues 12 and 17 allowed me to place the person whose sport is ice-hockey (who is also eating orange) on the left of the person who's hobby is singing or on the right of the person eating orange.
8. Clue 20 placed the person watching epic movies (who is also playing ice-hockey) in position 4.
9. Clues 16 and 6 allowed me to place the person eating eggplant (who is also a writer, but that was already determined) on the left of the person watching epic movies, which put them in position 3 or 2.
10. Since all positions were mostly filled, I used elimination to determine the remaining placements.


Please note that this puzzle required careful analysis and step-by-step deduction. There may be other ways to arrive at the solution, but this is one possible path."
