Zebra_domain_replacements_0	"After solving the logic puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|		|       1	|	2	|	3 	|	4	|	5	|
| City	| London	| Berlin | Marseilles| Nizza	| Colone|
| Color		| Blue    | Red   | Green     | Ivory  | Yellow|
| Job	| Electrician| Project-Manager | Architect | Social-worker | Dancer |
| Cigar		| Lucky-strike| Old-gold | chesterfield| Kools       |   parliament|
| Pet		| Horse    | Snails| Fox        | Dog      | Zebra     |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

* The person traveling to London is on the far left (9), and they like blue (14).
* The person who likes red travels to Berlin (1) and is in position 2.
* The architect likes green (3) and is in position 3, to the right of the person who likes ivory (5).
* The social-worker is in the middle (8), which means they are in position 4, traveling to Nizza with a dog (2).
* The person who smokes old-gold has snails as pets (6) and must be in position 2.
* The kools-smoker likes yellow (7) and is in position 5, next to the owner of the horse (11).
* The chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the fox owner (10), which means they are in position 3.
* The lucky-strike-smoker is the project-manager (12) and must be in position 1, traveling to London.
* The parliaments-smoker travels to Colone (13) and is in position 5.

The rest of the information falls into place with some careful deduction!"

#############
|        | 1         | 2          | 3           | 4          | 5          |
| Food   | pomegranate| strawberry | potato      | lime       | peach      |
| Color  | blue       | red        | ivory       | green      | yellow     |
| Sport  | handball  | golf       | surfing     | cycling    | skiing     |
| Cigar  | lucky-strike| chesterfield| old-gold   | kools      | parliament |
| Pet    | fox        | zebra      | snails      | dog        | horse      |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 9, we know that pomegranate is on the far left. From clue 14, we know that blue is to the left or right of pomegranate, so it must be in position 1.

From clue 2, we know that strawberry is associated with red (clue 1), and from clue 5, we know that green is to the right of ivory. So, the color sequence is: blue, ?, ?, green, ?. The only option for the middle three colors is: red, ivory, yellow.

From clue 8, we know that surfing is in the middle (position 3). Clue 4 tells us that cycling is associated with potato, and clue 7 tells us that kools are associated with yellow. So, the food sequence is: pomegranate, strawberry, potato, ?, peach (clue 13).

Clue 10 tells us that chesterfield is to the left or right of fox. Clue 11 tells us that kools are to the left or right of horse. The only possible arrangement for these three items is: fox, chesterfield, kools, ?, parliament.

Finally, clue 6 tells us that old-gold is associated with snails, and clue 12 tells us that lucky-strike is associated with handball. The remaining pets are zebra (associated with strawberry) and dog (associated with lime).

I hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns."
Zebra_domain_replacements_2	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a solution for the puzzle:


|		|       1	|	2	|	3 	|	4	|	5	|
| Food	| tomato	| cranberry | banana | carrot   | potato |
| Color		| blue     | red        | yellow | green    | ivory  |
| Hobby	|          | collecting  | board-games | photography | skydiving |
| Cigar		| lucky-strike | chesterfield | old-gold | kools      | parliament |
| Pet		| zebra   | fox        | snails  | horse    | dog       |

Here's how I arrived at the solution:


* From clue 9, we know that tomato is on the far left. 
* From clue 14, blue must be next to tomato, which puts it in position 1.
* From clue 2, cranberry (and red) can't be in position 1, so it's in position 2. This also means that potato (from clue 3) is not in position 1 or 2.
* Clue 5 tells us that green is to the right of ivory, and since collecting likes green, we know that collecting must be after ivory. But we don't know where yet.
* From clue 8, photography is in the middle (position 3), so board-games can't be there.
* Clue 6 places old-gold next to snails.
* Clue 4 says banana likes board-games, which puts it after photography. But we don't know where yet.
* From clue 11, kools (and yellow) is near horse.
* Clue 12 says lucky-strike likes skydiving, and since it can't be in position 3 (photography), it must be on one of the ends.
* Since kools is next to horse, we know that kools and yellow are not in positions 1 or 5. Therefore, green must be after ivory (position 4) because there's no other place for green to go!
* Putting everything together: 
	+ Position 1: blue + tomato (from clue 9)
	+ Position 2: red + cranberry
	+ Position 3: photography
	+ Position 4: green + collecting + old-gold + snails
	+ Position 5: ivory + potato + dog


Here's the final solution:


#############
|		|       1	|	2	|	3 	|	4	|	5	|
| Food	| tomato	| cranberry | banana | carrot   | potato |
| Color		| blue     | red        | yellow | green    | ivory  |
| Hobby	| skydiving | collecting  | board-games | photography | woodworking |
| Cigar		| lucky-strike | chesterfield | old-gold | kools      | parliament |
| Pet		| zebra   | fox        | snails  | horse    | dog       |
#############

Note: I made an educated guess on the last hobby (woodworking) since there was no direct clue linking it to a specific position."
