Zebra_domain_replacements_0	"After analyzing the clues, I've solved the puzzle and here is the final solution:

| Hobby          | Board-games | Fishing     | Photography| Writing     | Singing     |

Note that I've filled in the remaining music-genre cells based on the given clues:


chesterfield = trance (from clue 10)
parliament = rock (from clue 13, and parliament is a type of rock music)
olg-gold = quad-bikes (from clue 7)

And s = hip-hop (from clue 6), which matches with the hobby ""Writing"".

Zebra_domain_replacements_1	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a solution for the logic puzzle:


|		|       1	|	2	|	3 	|	4	|	5	|
| Transport	| helicopter	| quad-bike	| ship     | van    | skateboard |
| Birthday		| sept       | may         | july      | january | june       |
| City	| hannover	| hamburg   | venice    | berlin  | colone  |
| Cigar		| chesterfield| kools        | old-gold  | lucky-strike | parliament|
| Pet		| fox         | horse        | snails    | dog     | zebra      |

Here's how I arrived at the solution:


From clue 9, we know that the helicopter is on the far left. From clue 14, we can deduce that the person whose birthday is in September must be either to the right or left of the helicopter driver. Since there are only two options for this position (left and right), we can conclude that the person whose birthday is in September is also on the far left.


From clue 1, we know that the quad-bike driver's birthday is in May. This means that the person whose birthday is in July must be to the right of the person whose birthday is in January (clue 5). Therefore, the order for birthdays from left to right is: September, May, July, January, June.


Clue 4 states that the van driver travels to Berlin. Clue 2 tells us that the ship driver owns a dog. Since the person whose birthday is in January travels to Hannover (clue 3), we can conclude that this person must own a pet other than the dog. The only option left for the person whose birthday is in January is to travel by van to Berlin.


The skateboard driver smokes parliaments (clue 13). Since the kools-smoker's birthday is in June, and they are either to the left or right of the horse owner (clue 11), we can conclude that the kools-smoker must be in column 5. The only pet left for this person is the zebra.


The old-gold smoker owns snails (clue 6). Since the chesterfields-smoker is either to the left or right of the fox owner (clue 10), we can conclude that the chesterfields-smoker must be in column 1. The only option left for this person is to own a horse.


The lucky-strike smoker travels to Colone (clue 12). Since this is the only remaining city, and the van driver already has a pet assigned, we can assign the fox to this person.

The remaining options fall into place:

Zebra_domain_replacements_2	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|		|       1	|	2	|	3 	|	4	|	5	|
| Nationality	| norwegian	| english | japanese| spanish| ukranian|
| Sport		| surfing  	| cycling | basketball| ice-hockey| baseball |
| Birthday	| august      | september| may        | march    | december |
| Cigar		| parliament  | chesterfield| old-gold | lucky-strike| kools     |
| Game		| backgammon  | billiard | snooker    | poker     | domino    |


Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

1. From clue #9, we know that Norwegian is on the far left.
2. Clue #14 implies that Surfing must be next to Norwegian (either left or right). Since there's no other sport on the left, it must be on the same column as Norwegian.
3. Clue #1 says English is the person whose sport is cycling. Cycling can't be in column 1 because of clue #9, so it must be in column 2.
4. From clue #8, we know that May (the birthday) is in the middle. This means columns 3 and 4 are already fixed as the left and right pair for Ice-Hockey (March) and Basketball.
5. Clue #6 places Old-Gold with Snooker. Since March (Ice-Hockey) can't be next to May, it must be on column 4. Basketball is thus in column 3.
6. By eliminating other possibilities, Lucky-Strike goes with September, making column 2's birthday September.
7. Clue #11 fixes Kools as the cigar brand for Baseball (column 5).
8. Chesterfield can't go with Billiard on column 1 because of the Old-Gold and Snooker pair; thus it's in column 2 or column 4, but since December is already reserved by Ukranian in clue #4, Chesterfield goes with English.
9. From clue #10, Billiard must be between columns 2 and 3 (since it can't go next to Poker). The only space left for Billiard is thus column 2 or 3.
10. With the previous information and using elimination methods for the other games (backgammon, domino), we conclude that Ukranian plays dominoes in December.

Now we have all columns filled up correctly.
