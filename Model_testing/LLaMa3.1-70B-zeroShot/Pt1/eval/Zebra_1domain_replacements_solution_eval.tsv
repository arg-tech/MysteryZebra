|          |       1     |    2      |   3    |   4   |     5    |
| Nationality  |             |            |         |           |           |
| Norwegian  | English    | Ukrainian | Spanish| Japanese|
| Color      | Blue        | Ivory     | Green  | Yellow | Red       |
| Sport      | Parkour     | Weightlifting | Biathlon| Handball | Baseball  |
| Cigar      | Lucky-strike| Chesterfield | Old-gold| Kools   | Parliament |
| Pet        | Fox         | Horse     | Snails | Dog    | Zebra     |

Here's how I solved it:

* From clue 9, the Norwegian is on the far left.
* From clue 14, the Norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue. Since the Norwegian is on the left, the person who likes blue must be in position 1. This also means that the English (clue 1) cannot be in position 1, since they like red.
* From clue 5, the person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory. Since the Norwegian likes blue, and the person who likes green can't be in position 1, this means that the person who likes ivory must be in position 2, and the person who likes green must be in position 3.
* From clue 8, the person whose sport is weightlifting is in the middle (position 3).
* From clue 4, the Ukrainian is the person whose sport is biathlon. Since they can't be in position 1 or 5, and position 3 is taken by the weightlifter, this means that the Ukrainian must be in position 2.
* However, from clue 10, the Chesterfields-smoker (in position 2) is to the left or right of the owner of the fox. This can't be true if the Ukrainian is in position 2, since there's no one to their right. So the Ukrainian must be in position 4.
* From clue 7, the Kools-smoker likes yellow and is to the left or right of the owner of the horse (clue 11). Since the Ukrainian can't like yellow (they're already assigned to biathlon), this means that the person who likes yellow must be in position 5, and the owner of the horse must be in position 4.
* But wait! From clue 3, the person whose sport is baseball likes green. And from clue 5, they must be to the right of the person who likes ivory (position 2). This means that the person whose sport is baseball must be in position 3 or 4. Since we already know that the weightlifter is in position 3, this means that the person whose sport is baseball must be in position 5.
* However, this creates a conflict with our previous conclusion that the Kools-smoker (who likes yellow) is in position 5! The only way to resolve this is if the Spanish is in position 4 (they own the dog, clue 2), and the Japanese is in position 5 (since they're the only one left).
* From clue 13, the Japanese is the parliaments-smoker. So we can fill in the rest of the table.

I hope this explanation helps!

Zebra_domain_replacements_1	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a possible solution:


|		|       1	|	2	|	3 	|	4	|	5	|
| Birthday	| april    | march   | october| january| may     |
| Color		| blue     | yellow  | red     | green  | ivory   |
| Beverage	| water    | orange-juice | coffee  | tea     | milk    |
| Cigar		| lucky-strike | kools     | chesterfield | old-gold | parliament |
| Pet		| zebra    | horse    | fox      | snails  | dog     |

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

* From clue 9, the person whose birthday is in April is on the far left.
* From clue 14, the person whose birthday is in April is to the left or right of the person who likes blue. Since there's no one to the left of the April birthday, the blue color must be assigned to position 1.
* From clue 10, the Chesterfield-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox. This means that the chesterfield smoker cannot be in position 5 (since there's no one to the right). Therefore, the chesterfield smoker must be in either position 2 or 3.
* From clue 11, the Kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse. This means that the Kools-smoker cannot be in position 1 (since there's no one to the left). Therefore, the Kools-smoker must be in either position 2 or 4.
* From clue 7, the Kools-smoker is the person who likes yellow. Since we already know that the blue color is in position 1, the yellow color cannot be in position 1 (by process of elimination). Therefore, the yellow color must be assigned to position 2.
* From clue 13, the person whose birthday is in March is the parliaments-smoker. This means that the parliament smoker must be in either position 4 or 5 (since there's no one to the right of position 3).
* The rest of the clues can be applied to fill in the remaining gaps.
