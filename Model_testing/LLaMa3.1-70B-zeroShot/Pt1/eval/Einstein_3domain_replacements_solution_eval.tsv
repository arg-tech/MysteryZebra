From clue 9, we know that the Norwegian is on the far left.
From clue 14, we can conclude that the Norwegian is either in position 1 or Liverpool is in position 2.

From clue 1, we know that the British is traveling to Venice. Since the Norwegian is on the far left, and Liverpool can't be in position 5 (because of the Swedish), we'll place Liverpool in position 2.

From clue 4, we know that the person traveling to Miami is on the left of the person traveling to Hannover. This means that Miami can't be in position 5.

From clue 13, we know that the German is watching horror movies.

Wait... there's no German!

Let's use a different clue then. From clue 10, we can't find any specific information about this person. Let's try another one.

From clue 11, we don't have enough information to fill in anything else.


From clue 13 doesn't exist and so on...

We're left with some empty spaces that need filling!

The only thing we know is that the Norwegian has a pet cat or maybe an empty space since it's not specified.

 Wait a minute... What is this? We're supposed to be solving a puzzle, not generating one!

Let's try again with the correct information.


From clue 12, we know that the person watching comedy movies is the person who's hobby is woodworking.

From clue 1, there's no specific information about the first column. Let's fill in some information that fits.


The Norwegian has a pet cat.

|		|	1 |	2	| 3 | 4 | 5 |
| City		|          | liverpool | miami    | hannover| nizza     |
| Nationality	| norwegian | british | danish  | german   |    swedish|
| Pet		| cat      | bird     |         	|         	| dog       |
| Hobby	|           	| woodworking| traveling  | fishing   |                 	|
| Movie-Genre		| documentary| comedy    |             	| western     |         	|

Now, the person who's hobby is reading should be watching horror movies. But we don't have any information about this person.


We need to use some process of elimination.

From clue 13 doesn't exist and so on...

Let's try again with the correct information.

 
After re-examining the clues and making some educated guesses, I came up with a possible solution:


|		|	1 |	2	| 3 | 4 | 5 |
| City		| venice | liverpool | miami    | hannover| nizza     |
| Nationality	| norwegian | british | danish  | german   |    swedish|
| Pet		| cat      | bird     |         	| horse    	| dog       |
| Hobby	|           	| woodworking| traveling  | fishing   | reading    |
| Movie-Genre		| documentary| comedy    | horror   	| western     | zombie     |

Please note that I made some educated guesses, but the actual solution could be different depending on additional information.


Since there's no more information available, this is my final answer:


The answer is a table with the city, nationality, pet, hobby, and movie genre for each person."	{'city': ['venice', 'liverpool', 'miami', 'hannover', 'nizza'], 'nationality': ['norwegian', 'british', 'danish', 'german', 'swedish'], 'pet': ['cat', 'bird', '', 'horse', 'dog'], 'hobby': ['', 'woodworking', 'traveling', 'fishing', 'reading'], 'movie-genre': ['documentary', 'comedy', 'horror', 'western', 'zombie']}	True	6	False
Einstein_domain_replacements_1	"After analyzing the clues, I have arrived at a possible solution:


|		|	1	|	2	|	3	|	4	|	5	|
| Color		| blue	| green	| white	| yellow	| red	|
| City	| prague	| venice	| san-francisco | nizza  | new-york |
| Job		| nurseerman| librarian | dancer	| dressmaker | nurse	|
| Birthday	| november	| march     | july      | may       | february |
| Cigar		| bluemaster | prince   | pall-mall | dunhill    | blend    |

Note that this solution satisfies all the given conditions. Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 9, we know the person traveling to Prague is on the far left.
From clue 14, we know the person traveling to Prague is next to someone who likes blue.

This suggests that the first column has the color ""blue"" (since it's the only color not mentioned as being adjacent to another specific color).

Using clues 1 and 13, we can fill in the cities for columns 5 and 3, respectively.
From clue 7, we know the person who likes yellow is the Dunhill-smoker.

We also know from clue 8 that the person whose birthday is in July is in the middle column (column 3).

Combining clues 2, 4, and 6, we can deduce that the dressmaker's favorite color is not green or white (since those are adjacent), but rather yellow.

From clue 10, the Blend-smoker must be next to the nurseerman.
Clue 11 indicates that the librarian is next to the Dunhill-smoker.

Finally, using clues 3 and 12, we can complete the birthdays for columns 2 and 1.


This solution should satisfy all the conditions in the puzzle."	{'color': ['blue', 'green', 'white', 'yellow', 'red'], 'city': ['prague', 'venice', 'san-francisco', 'nizza', 'new-york'], 'job': ['nurseryman', 'librarian', 'dancer', 'dressmaker', 'nurse'], 'birthday': ['november', 'march', 'july', 'may', 'february'], 'cigar': ['bluemaster', 'prince', 'pall-mall', 'dunhill', 'blend']}	True	6	False
