Note that this solution satisfies all the conditions given in the puzzle. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 9, we know the German is on the far left.
* Clue 14 tells us that the German is to the left or right of the person who likes coral. Since the German is already on the left, this means the person who likes coral must be in position 2. However, from clue 1, we know the Malaysian (who likes orange) can't be in position 2, so the person who likes coral must be to the right of the German.
* Clue 4 tells us that the Dutch is drinking almond-lemonade, which places them in position 3 (since lemonade is in the middle according to clue 8).
* From clue 5, we know the person who likes black is to the right of the person who likes aquamarine. This means aquamarine must be in position 2, and black must be in position 4.
* Clue 7 tells us that the havana-smoker likes chestnut, so they must be in position 5 (since black is already in position 4).
* The rest of the clues can be used to fill in the remaining information.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. From clue 9, we know that the German is on the far left.
2. From clue 14, we know that the German is to the left or right of the person who likes chestnut. Since the German is already placed on the left, the person who likes chestnut must be in position 1 (the only option). So, the color for the German is Chestnut.
3. From clue 1, we know that the Colombian is the person who likes Light-chestnut. We can place them in position 2.
4. From clue 8, we know that the person drinking Soy-milk is in the middle. This means they are in position 3. Since no other clues mention Soy-milk yet, let's keep this information for now and come back to it later.
5. From clue 10, we know that the Dunhill-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the Cat. We can place them together in positions 1 and 2, but since the German (in position 1) already has a color, let's try placing them in positions 3 and 4 instead.
6. From clue 7, we know that the Oliveros-smoker is the person who likes Coral. Since they can't be in position 5 (because of clue 11), let's place them in position 5 for now.
7. From clue 12, we know that the Swisher-smoker is the person drinking Fanta. We can place them in position 5, replacing Oliveros.
8. From clue 13, we know that the Nigerian is the Tiparillo-smoker. This means they are not the Oliveros-smoker (since they're already in position 5). Let's place them in a different position for now.
9. From clue 4, we know that the Argentine is the person drinking Juice. We can place them in an empty spot.
10. From clue 3, we know that the person drinking Cola is the person who likes Lilac. Since they're to the right of Fuchsia (clue 5), let's place them in position 4 and move Fuchsia to position 2 or 3.
11. Now, we can use clue 8 again: since Soy-milk is in the middle, we know that the person drinking Juice must be in either position 1, 2, or 4 (the only non-middle positions). We already have a person in position 1 and a different drink for position 4. So, let's place them in position 2.
12. With Argentine now in position 3, we can move Soy-milk from the middle to this spot.
13. From clue 11, we know that Oliveros-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the Hamster. Since they're already placed next to Fuchsia (in positions 2 and 3), let's place them in position 3.
14. Now, we can fill in the remaining gaps:
	* From clue 6, we know that Aristoff-smoker is the owner of the Mouse. Let's place them in position 1.
	* The only remaining cigar brand (Dunhill) goes to the German.
	* The only remaining color (Coral) goes to Oliveros-smoker.
	* Brazilian is the owner of the Goldfish, so they go to position 4.

| Pet        | chinchilla | frog       | hamster   | pony        | rabbit   |

#############


Explanation:

* From clue 9, the dutch is on the far left. This gives us the first column.
* From clue 1, the nigerian is the person who likes ebony, and from clue 14, the dutch is to the left or right of the person who likes white. Since the dutch is already on the far left, the nigerian must be in column 2, with ebony as their favorite color.
* From clue 3, the person drinking almond-soy-milk is the person who likes lilac, and from clue 5, this person is to the right of the person who likes blood-red. This means the person who likes lilac must be in column 3 or 4.
* From clue 2, the canadian is the owner of the rabbit, which must be in either column 4 or 5 (since the nigerian is already in column 2).
* From clue 8, the person drinking soy-milk is in the middle, so they must be in column 3.
* From clue 7, the montecristo-smoker is the person who likes amber, and from clue 11, this person is to the left or right of the owner of the hamster. Since the hamster can't be in column 1 (because of the dutch), it must be in either column 2 or 4.
* From clue 10, the dannemann-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the pony, and from clue 12, the tiparillo-smoker is the person drinking fanta. Since the person drinking almond-soy-milk (lilac) is already in column 3, the person drinking fanta must be in either column 4 or 5.
* From clue 13, the pakistani is the game-smoker, and from clue 6, the swisher-smoker is the owner of the chinchilla. Since the dutch is on the far left, the swisher-smoker must be in column 1.

By combining these deductions, we can fill out the rest of the table to get the final solution.
