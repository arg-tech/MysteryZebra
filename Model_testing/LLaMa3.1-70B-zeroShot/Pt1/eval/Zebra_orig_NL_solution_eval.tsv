| Pet           | Fox         | Horse       | Snails      | Dog         | Zebra       |


#############

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning:

* From clue 9, we know the Norwegian is on the far left. Clue 14 tells us that the Norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue. This means the person who likes yellow (clue 7) must be the Norwegian.
* From clue 10, we know the Chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox. Since the Ukrainian drinks tea (clue 4), and the English likes red (clue 1), the Ukrainian can't be the Chesterfields-smoker. Therefore, the Ukrainian must own a horse (by process of elimination).
* From clue 6, we know the Old-gold smoker owns snails. Clue 5 tells us that the person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory. Since the English likes red and can't be in position 3 or 4, the person who likes green must own a dog (Spanish) and the person who likes ivory must be Japanese.
* From clue 11, we know the Kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse. Since the Ukrainian owns a horse, the Kools-smoker must be either Norwegian or English. But the English can't smoke Kools (clue 7), so it must be the Norwegian.
* From clue 12, we know the Lucky-strike smoker drinks orange-juice. The Japanese is the Parliament-smoker (clue 13), and the Ukrainian drinks tea, so the Lucky-strike smoker must be in position 4. The only remaining option for the beverage is coffee, which goes to the person who likes green (English).
* Finally, from clue 3, we know the person drinking coffee is the person who likes green. This confirms our previous deduction.

I hope this explanation helps!

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

* The Norwegian is on the far left (Clue 9), and since they can't be next to the person who likes blue (Clue 14), the yellow color is assigned to them.
* The Kools-smoker is next to the horse owner (Clue 11), so the fox is placed with the Norwegian.
* The English is paired with red (Clue 1) and is on the right of the person who likes ivory (Clue 5).
* The Spanish is paired with the dog (Clue 2) and is on the far right (since the Japanese is paired with Parliament, Clue 13).
* The Ukrainian drinks tea (Clue 4) and is in the middle column.
* The person drinking coffee likes green (Clue 3), so they're placed next to the English.
* The Old-gold-smoker has snails as pets (Clue 6), which is paired with the Japanese, but since that's not possible, it's paired with the Spanish instead.
* The Lucky-strike-smoker drinks orange-juice (Clue 12) and is placed next to the Ukrainian.
