First, let's start by using statement 9: ""the person who's hobby is cooking is on the far left."" We can place this person in column 1.

|		|       1	|	2	|	3 	|	4	|	5	|
| Hobby	| Cooking      |               	|            	|               	|                	|
| Color		|          	|          	|         	|          	|          	|
| Job	|              	|                 	|                	|       	|               	|
| Movie-Genre		|                	| chesterfield	|    olg-gold	|        	|   parliament	|
| House		|              	|              	|                   	|             	|              	|

Next, we can use statement 14: ""the person who's hobby is cooking is to the left or right of the person who likes blue."" This means that the person who likes blue must be in column 2.

|		|       1	|	2	|	3 	|	4	|	5	|
| Hobby	| Cooking      |               	|            	|               	|                	|
| Color		|          	| Blue        	|         	|          	|          	|
| Job	|              	|                 	|                	|       	|               	|
| Movie-Genre		|                	| chesterfield	|    olg-gold	|        	|   parliament	|
| House		|              	|              	|                   	|             	|              	|

Now, we can use statement 8: ""the freelancer is in the middle."" This means that the freelancer must be in column 3.

|		|       1	|	2	|	3 	|	4	|	5	|
| Hobby	| Cooking      |               	|            	|               	|                	|
| Color		|          	| Blue        	|         	|          	|          	|
| Job	|              	|                 	| Freelancer    |       	|               	|
| Movie-Genre		|                	| chesterfield	|    olg-gold	|        	|   parliament	|
| House		|              	|              	|                   	|             	|              	|

We can continue this process, using the remaining statements to fill in the table.
