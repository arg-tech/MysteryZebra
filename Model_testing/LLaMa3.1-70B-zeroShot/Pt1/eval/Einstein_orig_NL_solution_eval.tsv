|		|	1	|	2	|	3	|	4	|	5	|
| Color		| blue | green | white | yellow | red |
| Nationality	| norwegian | british | danish | german | swedish	|
| Pet		| fish | cat | horse | bird | dog |
| Beverage	| water | coffee | milk | beer | tea |
| Cigar		| master | prince | blend | dunhill | bluemaster |

Here's how the solution was derived:

From clue 9, the Norwegian is on the far left. From clue 14, the Norwegian is on the left or right of the person who likes blue, so the color in column 1 is blue.

From clue 4, the person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white. Since the Norwegian (column 1) already has a color assigned (blue), the person who likes green must be in column 2, and the person who likes white must be in column 3.

From clue 5, the person who likes green drinks coffee. From clue 8, the person drinking milk is in the middle, so the beverage in column 3 is milk.

From clue 6, the pall-mall-smoker (who smokes blend) owns a bird, and from clue 11, the owner of the horse is on the left or right of the dunhill-smoker. Since the person who likes yellow (column 4) smokes dunhill (clue 7), the pet in column 3 must be a horse.

From clue 10, the blend-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the cat. The only available spot for the cat is in column 2, so the pet in column 2 is a cat.

From clue 15, the blend-smoker is on the left or right of the person drinking water. Since the beverage in column 3 is milk (from clue 8), the blend-smoker must be on the left of the person drinking water. This means that the beverage in column 1 is water.

The rest of the solution can be derived from the remaining clues.

Please note that there might be other possible solutions, but this is one of them.

Here's a brief explanation for each row:

* Color: Clue 14 suggests the Norwegian (leftmost) likes blue. The yellow color is associated with the Dunhill-smoker (clue 7), who is in the second position. Green and white are in adjacent positions, with green on the left of white (clue 4). Red is associated with the British (clue 1).
* Nationality: Clues 2, 3, 9, and 13 help determine the nationalities.
* Pet: The Norwegian's pet is unknown, but the Blend-smoker (first or last) must be near the Cat owner (clue 10). Since the Swedish person has a dog (clue 2), and it can't be in position 1 or 5 due to other constraints, I've placed the Cat in position 1. The Horse is on either side of the Dunhill-smoker (clue 11).
* Beverage: Coffee is associated with green (clue 5) and Beer with Bluemaster (clue 12). Milk is in the middle (clue 8), Tea belongs to the Danish person (clue 3), and Water must be near the Blend-smoker (clue 15).
* Cigar: The Dunhill-smoker likes yellow, Pall-mall has a bird as pet (clue 6), Bluemaster drinks beer, Prince is smoked by the German, and the Blend-smoker is in position 1 or 5.
