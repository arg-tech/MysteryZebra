Einstein_domain_replacements_0	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a possible solution:


#############

|		|	1	|	2	|	3	|	4	|	5	|
| Transport		| motorbike | subway 	| train 	| snowmobile | quad-bike |
| Music-Genre	| folk 	| trance	| ambient 	| rock     | reggae   |
| Birthday		| june 	| may   	| february | september | july    |
| House	| futuristic| wooden 	| gothic-revival | palace  | ranch-style |
| Job		| librarian| mechanic | bartender | architect | motorbikemaster |

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 1, we know the fan of trance is driving the train.
* Clue 4 tells us that the subway driver is to the left of the snowmobile driver. Since the gothic-revival house is in the middle (clue 8), and the wooden house is driven by the subway driver (clue 5), we can deduce that the subway driver is in column 2.
* Clues 9 and 14 together tell us that the fan of folk is on the far left, driving a motorbike. This must be column 1.
* From clue 6, we know the architect's birthday is in May. Since the librarian is on the left or right of someone born in June (clue 10), and the futuristic house is also on the left or right of the librarian (clue 15), we can deduce that column 1 has a birthday in June.
* Clues 11 and 7 together tell us that the mechanic drives a quad-bike, which must be in column 5. The person born in July is on the left or right of the mechanic.
* Clue 3 tells us that the fan of rock lives in a palace house. Since this can't be the same as the motorbikemaster's ranch-style house (clue 12), it must be column 4.
* Finally, clue 2 places the reggae fan with a birthday in September. This must be column 5.

Note that there might be other possible solutions, but this one seems to satisfy all the given constraints."	{'transport': ['motorbike', 'subway', 'train', 'snowmobile', 'quad-bike'], 'music-genre': ['folk', 'trance', 'ambient', 'rock', 'reggae'], 'birthday': ['june', 'may', 'february', 'september', 'july'], 'house': ['futuristic', 'wooden', 'gothic-revival', 'palace', 'ranch-style'], 'job': ['librarian', 'mechanic', 'bartender', 'architect', 'motorbikemaster']}	True	7	False

Let me recheck the clues... Ah-ha! I found a mistake.

|		|	1	|	2	|	3	|	4	|	5	|
| Food		| kale    |   blueberry  | tomato    | nectarine | corn      |
| Birthday	| march | february  | july       | august     | may        |
| Sport		| rugby  | baseball  | skiing    | climbing  | handball |
| Music-Genre	| indie  | pop          | salsa      | electronic | jazz     |
| Transport		| trike   | car         | airplane   | boat       | train     |

 
Here's the explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


From (9), we know that march is on the far left.


From (14), march must be either eating kale or next to someone who eats kale. Since there is no other food left for the first column, march must eat kale.


From (2), february is baseball and it cannot be in column 1 as march is already occupying that spot. Therefore, february is in column 2.


From (7), blueberry is driving a car and from (10) or (11) we can see that the trike must be on either side of rugby and skiing is on either side of the person who drives the car.


Since baseball cannot have skiing as it would create a conflict with february's position in column 2, therefore february/baseball eats blueberry.


From (4), tomato is to the left of nectarine. From (5) and (8), we can see that salsa/indie must be in columns 3 or 4. Therefore, july cannot eat nectarine as it would create a conflict with their birthday and music-genre combination.


Since february/blueberry eats blueberry, march/kale must eat kale and from (12) train/jazz must also eat kale but this will contradict the fact that march eats kale and hence we can deduce that july eats nectarine.


From (3), august is electronic. Since july cannot be salsa or indie as they are in columns 3/4, therefore july must drive the airplane as there is no other transport left for them to use.


Since july drives an airplane and february/blueberry drives a car from (7) then march/kale eats kale must drive a trike. 


From (10), rugby cannot be driving a trike but since february/baseball already occupies column 2, therefore march/kale eats kale must eat kale and drive the trike.


From (13), july drives an airplane hence the person driving a boat is climbing from (6).


The remaining sport which has not been assigned to any one yet is handball. From (11) we can see that skiing must be on either side of car/blueberry.


Since february/blueball eats blueberry and drives a car then july/nectarine cannot eat nectarine as they drive an airplane hence may/corn must be in column 5. 


From (1), the person eating corn is born in may which we can see is already the case here. Therefore, from (10) and (11), skiing/rugby cannot be driving a trike.


Finally since march/kale eats kale drives a trike then february/blueberry/baseball eats blueberry must eat blueberry and drive a car and july/nectarine drives an airplane hence we can deduce that the person in column 4 who eats nectarine is climbing.


Also from (11) we can see that skiing/rugby cannot be driving a train so it must be driving a boat which conflicts with what we have already established, therefore july/nectarine cannot eat nectarine as they drive an airplane hence may/corn must be in column 5 and hence the person eating tomato is salsa from (4) and (5).


From (8), indie must be in column 3. From (15), pop cannot be driving a trike so it must be next to someone who drives a trike.


Therefore, we can deduce that february/blueberry/baseball/pop eats blueberry and july/nectarine/electronic is not indie hence the person eating nectarine must eat electronic.


Since we already have established that may/corn is in column 5 then from (12), march/kale eats kale and drives a trike hence the person driving the train must be jazz from (12).


Also since july/nectarine/electronic drives an airplane hence february/blueberry/baseball/pop cannot drive a boat so it must eat pop.


Finally, we can see that february/blueberry/baseball eats blueberry and drives a car and may/corn is in column 5. Also march/kale eats kale and drives a trike so it must be that may/corn is on the far right as the train/jazz has already been assigned to eat something else (column 1)."	{'food': ['kale', 'blueberry', 'tomato', 'nectarine', 'corn'], 'birthday': ['march', 'february', 'july', 'august', 'may'], 'sport': ['rugby', 'baseball', 'skiing', 'climbing', 'handball'], 'music-genre': ['indie', 'pop', 'salsa', 'electronic', 'jazz'], 'transport': ['trike', 'car', 'airplane', 'boat', 'train']}	True	4	False
