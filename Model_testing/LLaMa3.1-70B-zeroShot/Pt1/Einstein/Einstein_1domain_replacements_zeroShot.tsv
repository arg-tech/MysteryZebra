Einstein_domain_replacements_0	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a possible solution:


|		|	1	|	2	|	3	|	4	|	5	|
| Color		| blue	| green	| yellow	| white	| red   |
| Nationality	| norwegian | danish  | german    | british  | swedish	|
| Pet		| horse	| fish 	| cat   	| bird     | dog     |
| Hobby	| photography | fishing  | filmmaking| chess    | woodworking|
| Cigar		| blend	| pall-mall | dunhill   | prince   | bluemaster|


Here's how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 9, the norwegian is on the far left, so they're in position 1.
* Clue 14 says the norwegian is next to someone who likes blue. Since the norwegian can't be next to themselves, they must be next to someone who likes blue, which is the person in position 2. Therefore, the color of position 2 is not mentioned as green (yet).
* From clue 4, the person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white. The only possibility for this arrangement is if the person who likes green is in position 3 and the person who likes white is in position 4.
* Clue 5 states that the person who likes green also has a hobby of fishing, so the person in position 2 must have a different hobby (fishing) than the one mentioned as chess (danish). This leads me to conclude that the color of position 2 is indeed green.
* From clue 7, the yellow dunhill-smoker is not on the leftmost or rightmost positions. The only possibility for this is if they're in position 3. Clue 11 further confirms this arrangement since the owner of the horse (position 1) must be next to the dunhill-smoker.
* From clue 10, the blend-smoker is next to either the cat's owner or a person with photography as their hobby. Since the person in position 1 has a hobby of photography, they're likely not next to the blend-smoker. This means that the blend-smoker must be on the left side (position 1).
* Clue 15 further confirms this arrangement by stating that the blend-smoker is also next to someone with photography as their hobby.
* Clues 2 and 13 place the german prince-smoker in position 4.
* The remaining positions are filled using clues 6, 8, and 12.


The final solution:

Einstein_domain_replacements_1	"Here's the step-by-step process to solve this puzzle.


From clues 9 and 14, we can determine that either clue 4 (green/white) or clue 7 (yellow/dunhill) must be placed on column 1. However, if yellow is on column 1, it would contradict with the positioning from clue 11, hence green must be placed on column 1.


Clue 5 states that the person who likes green drinks coffee, which eliminates columns 3 and 4 from containing the green/white combo due to clue 8 (milk in middle), therefore white is on column 2.


From clues 13 and 11, we can deduce pear's position must be on either column 4 or 5 since horses and dunhill-smoker must be placed next to each other but they cannot both be adjacent with prince smoker.


The only valid position for green/white in columns 1-2 eliminates the dunhill-smoker (yellow) being placed before blue. As per clue 14, radish is on column 1 so blue has to be on column 2 which contradicts the placement from clue 4, hence white cannot be adjacent with yellow and therefore must be next to red (cucumber), deduced in later steps


Clue 10 states that blend-smoker is placed next to cat owner. Clues 12 and 15 place bluemaster on column 5 and water on either side of the blend smoker.


From clues 1, 3, 8, and the previous step we can determine columns 2-4 must contain blue (bluemaster), white (beer/cucumber), yellow (dunhill) respectively. Column 4 cannot be pear since bluemaster-smoker is not the prince-smoker


Bluemaster's column can only have red in it as the other options for color are already placed or contradict clues, and cucumber must be on either columns 3 or 5 from clue 1.


From clue 6, pall-mall must be adjacent with bird owner. Since the position for green is already determined (column 1) so column 2 has to contain white and it must be next to red in column 5 since yellow cannot be placed in column 4


By using clues 3 and 8 we can determine lettuce/tea's placement on column 3, and cucumber/red's placement on column 5.


Now with pear being placed on column 4 from clue 13, grapes must go on either columns 2 or 3. But since tea is already present in column 3 it must be the grapes owner who is adjacent with pall-mall/bird which makes dog's column as column 2


Columns 1 and 5 have to contain fish (coffee) and cat owners respectively, since the other options for pets are already placed or contradict clues.


The final solution table:
