Einstein_domain_replacements_0	"Here's the solved puzzle:


|		|	1	|	2	|	3	|	4	|	5	|
| Color		| blue  | green | white| yellow| red   |
| Nationality	| norwegian | british | german| danish | swedish|
| Food		| lemon  | eggplant| onion | lime   | strawberry|
| House	| cottage| townhouse| palace| tower  | modern |
| Cigar		| bluemaster | pall-mall| blend | dunhill| prince |


Here's how the puzzle was solved:


From (9), norwegian is on the far left.
From (14), the person who likes blue must be on either side of the norwegian, so it can't be in 4 or 5. Since the palace house is in the middle (8), and the bluemaster-smoker has a cottage house (12), it's likely that the person who likes blue is on the far left, with the norwegian. So, color for column 1 is blue.


From (7), yellow is associated with dunhill. From (11), eggplant must be on either side of the dunhill-smoker. Since lemon is on one end (10), and strawberry is already given to swedish in (2), lime and onion are left for columns 3 or 4, so it's more likely that the dunhill-smoker is column 4. This also puts yellow as the color for column 4.


From (6), onion must be associated with pall-mall, but since blend-smoker has a lemon-eater on one side and modern house on the other (15), blend can't be in column 5, so it's likely that pall-mall is column 3. From (10), this puts lemon as column 1.


From (4) green must be to the left of white, but since there are no more colors for column 2, and since townhouse house is associated with green (5), we can safely put green in column 2.


From (13), german is prince-smoker. Since norwegian has a blue color on one end, the only option left for german is column 3, putting white as the color for column 3.


From (1) and (2) red is british, strawberry is swedish, so the remaining columns are filled with danish in tower house, giving red to column 5."
Einstein_domain_replacements_1	"After solving the logic puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


|		|	1	|	2	|	3	|	4	|	5	|
| Color		| blue	| green | white | yellow | red  |
| Sport	| parkour | skateboarding | soccer | snowboarding | tennis  |
| Birthday		| february | november | june | april | january  |
| Beverage	| water   | coffee    | milk   | beer     | tea      |
| Cigar		| blend   | pall-mall | prince | dunhill  | bluemaster |

Explanation:

From clue 9, parkour is on the far left. From clue 14, blue is next to parkour, so it's in position 1.

From clue 4, green is left of white, and from clue 5, green drinks coffee. So, green is in position 2, and white is in position 3.

From clue 8, milk is in the middle, which means position 3 or 4. But since green drinks coffee and white is next to it, milk must be in position 4.

From clue 7, yellow is dunhill-smoker, and from clue 11, november is left of right of dunhill-smoker. Since blue and green are already placed, november must be in position 2 or 5. But since parkour is on the far left, november can't be in position 1. So, november is in position 2, which means yellow is in position 4.

From clue 6, pall-mall-smoker's birthday is in april, so april must be in position 3 or 4. But since milk is already in the middle (position 3), april can't be there. So, april is in position 4.

Now we have:

|		|	1	|	2	|	3	|	4	|	5	|
| Color		| blue	| green | white | yellow |    |
| Sport	| parkour | skateboarding |   | snowboarding | tennis  |
| Birthday		| february | november | june | april | january  |
| Beverage	| water   | coffee    | milk   | beer     | tea      |
| Cigar		| blend   | pall-mall | prince | dunhill  | bluemaster |

From clue 1, tennis is red. From clue 3, skateboarding drinks tea.

Since parkour is on the far left, and blue is next to it, soccer must be in position 5 (because prince-smoker is soccer).

The final solution is:
