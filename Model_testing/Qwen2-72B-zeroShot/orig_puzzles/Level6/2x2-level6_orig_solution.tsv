Lv6-2x2-1	"Based on the given puzzle:

1. The person who plays soccer is on the far left.
2. The person who plays volleyball does not eat pears.

We can create the following solution table:

| Food     | nectarine | pear         |

| Food    | apple   | lemon        |
| Pet     | goat    | guinea-pig  |

Puzzle Solution:

The owner of the goat is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig, which means the goat must be in column 1. Therefore, the owner of the goat (column 1) cannot eat lemon (rule 6), so they must eat apple.

Lv6-2x2-4	"Based on the given information, we can deduce the following:

1. Grapefruit cannot be eaten by the goldfish owner.
2. Grapefruit eater is to the right of the apricot eater.

Let's denote the food eaters and pet owners as follows:

- A: Apricot eater
- G: Grapefruit eater
- X: Goldfish owner
- Y: Hamster owner

From clue 1, we know that G cannot be X. From clue 2, we know that G is to the right of A.

Now let's fill in the table:
#############
|         |    1      |     2       |
| Food    |   A   |  G      |
| Pet     |   X   |  Y      |
#############
Since there are only two options for both food and pets, and we have the constraints from the clues, this table represents the final solution."
Lv6-2x2-5	"Based on the given logic puzzle, we can fill in the table as follows:

|                |    1      |     2      |
| Movie-Genre    | musical    | superhero   |
| Sport          | golf       | lacrosse    |

From clue 1, we know that the person watching superhero movies is not the person who's sport is lacrosse. This means that the superhero movie must be in column 2, and therefore musical must be in column 1.

From clue 2, we know that the person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since superhero movies are already placed in column 2, lacrosse must be in column 1. This means golf must be in column 2.

Now, putting '#############' around the final solution table:

|                |    1      |     2      |
| Movie-Genre    | musical    | superhero   |

Lv6-2x2-7	"Based on the given information, we can deduce the following:

1. The accountant is either in Job 1 or Job 3 (odd positions).
2. The accountant does not have a hamster as a pet.

Let's fill in the table based on these deductions:

|        |     1       |       2        |

| Pet     |               |                 |

Since we don't have enough information to determine specific positions for the accountant or the pets, we cannot complete the table with certainty.

However, if we were given more details or additional rules, it would be possible to solve the puzzle completely."

Lv6-2x2-10	"Based on the given information, we can deduce the following:

1. The firefighter does not drive the helicopter.
2. The entrepreneur is either in the second or fourth position.

Now let's fill in the table accordingly:
#############
|              |      1       |      2        |
| Job          |     FF       |    E or FF   |
| Transport    |  van or heli |  heli or van |
#############
Since we have two possible arrangements for position 2 (entrepreneur or firefighter), we cannot definitively fill in the table with a single unique solution. Therefore, placing '#############' around the final solution table would be inappropriate in this case."
