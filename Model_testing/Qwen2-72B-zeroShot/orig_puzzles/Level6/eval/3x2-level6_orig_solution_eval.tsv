| Job            | project-manager   | teacher   |

| Pet            | bird                | ferret    |

The person on the right of the owner of the ferret (Pet: ferret) is the one watching musical movies (Movie-Genre: musical). This means that the project-manager (Job: project-manager) cannot be the person watching musical movies, as stated in clue 1.

So, we have the final solution table:

Lv6-3x2-2	"Based on the given puzzle, we can fill in the table as follows:

|                |    1     |     2       |

| Food           | pepper   | pumpkin      |
| Hobby          | baking    | card-games    |
| Movie-Genre    | disaster  | musical        |

Now, applying the rules:

1. The person with a hobby of baking does not eat pumpkin.
2. The person with a hobby of baking is to the left of the person watching disaster movies.

Based on these rules, we can update the table:

|                |    1     |     2       |

| Job      | Scientist    | Dressmaker     |
| Pet      | Hamster     | Mouse           |

Now, applying clues:

1. The person who's hobby is gardening is not the owner of the hamster.
Since the gardener owns the mouse (the other pet option), this clue doesn't change our current table.

2. The owner of the hamster is on the right of the scientist.
This means that the dressmaker must be on the right, as she is the only one left to the scientist.

Final Solution:

|          |     1      |      2       |

| Nationality    |  brazilian| nigerian    |
| Transport      |    ship    |    trike    |

From clue 1, the brazilian is on the right of the person driving the ship. Since the ship driver must be either in position 1 or 2, and the brazilian must be on their right, the only possible configuration for this clue is:

- Nationality at Position 2: nigerian
- Music-Genre at Position 2: funk
- Transport at Position 2: trike

- Nationality at Position 1: brazilian
- Music-Genre at Position 1: indie
- Transport at Position 1: ship

From clue 2, the fan of funk is not the person driving the trike. Since we already know from clue 1 that the trike driver is nigerian and a fan of funk, this clue doesn't change our initial configuration.

From clue 3, the final solution table should be surrounded by '#############'.

The final solution table is:

Lv6-3x2-9	"Based on the given puzzle and rules:

1. The person eating zucchini is on the right of the person drinking water.
2. The person eating zucchini is not the person driving the roller.

Let's fill in the table step by step:

- Since there are 2 different beverages and we have 3 categories, one category must have a repeated beverage. Let's place ""fanta"" for Food and ""water"" for Beverage.

|              |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage     | water    | fanta       |
| Food         | fanta    | avocado     |
| Transport    |          |            |

- Now, according to rule 1, the person eating zucchini (which is in column 2) must be on the right of the person drinking water (which is also in column 2). This means that ""zucchini"" should go in the last row.

|              |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage     | water    | fanta       |
| Food         | fanta    | avocado     |
| Transport    |          |            |

- Finally, we know from rule 6 that the person eating zucchini is not driving the roller. Since ""zucchini"" is already placed in column 2 and row 4, this means that ""roller"" must be placed in column 1 of either row 2 or row 3.

To avoid placing two different types of food in the same column, let's place ""roller"" in column 1 of row 3. This leaves column 1 of row 2 open for a Food item.

|              |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage     | water    | fanta       |
| Food         | fanta    | avocado     |
| Transport    | roller   |            |

Now, we need to place the remaining Food item in column 1 of row 2. Since we have ""avocado"" and ""zucchini,"" let's place ""zucchini"" here.

|              |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage     | water    | fanta       |
| Food         | zucchini | avocado     |
| Transport    | roller   |            |

Finally, we need to fill in the Transport category. Since we have ""motorbike"" and ""roller,"" let's place ""motorbike"" in column 2 of row 4.

|              |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage     | water    | fanta       |
| Food         | zucchini | avocado     |
| Transport    | roller   | motorbike   |

Now, we will put '#############' around the final solution table:

```

|	     |    1     |     2      |
