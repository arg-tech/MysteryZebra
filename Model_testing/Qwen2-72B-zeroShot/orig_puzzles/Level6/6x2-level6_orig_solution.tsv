Lv6-6x2-1	"Based on the given puzzle:

1. The documentary watcher is left of the sailing person.
2. The 7up drinker doesn't play basketball.
3. The horse owner is beside the basketball player.
4. The fisherman is right of the pop music fan.

Let's solve it step by step:

1. Start with fixed positions: Since the fisherman is on the right of the pop music fan, we can place these two in opposite corners:

|                |       1        |     2      |
| Beverage       |                |            |
| Job             |   Fisherman    |    ?       |
| Movie-Genre     |                |            |
| Music-Genre     |    Pop          |    ?       |
| Pet              |                |            |
| Sport            |                |            |

2. Now we can place the documentary watcher and the sailing person based on clue 1:

|                |       1        |     2      |
| Beverage       |                |            |
| Job             |   Fisherman    |    ?       |
| Movie-Genre     |  Documentary     |   Comedy    |
| Music-Genre     |    Pop          |    ?       |
| Pet              |                |            |
| Sport            |   Sailing        | Basketball  |

3. We can place the horse owner and the basketball player based on clue 3:

|                |       1        |     2      |
| Beverage       |                |            |

| Pet              |   Horse          |    Ferret    |
| Sport            |   Sailing        | Basketball  |

4. Now we can place the beverage based on clue 2:

|                |       1        |     2      |
| Beverage       |   Hot-Chocolate |     7up     |
| Job             |   Fisherman    |   Journalist   |
| Movie-Genre     |  Documentary     |   Comedy    |
