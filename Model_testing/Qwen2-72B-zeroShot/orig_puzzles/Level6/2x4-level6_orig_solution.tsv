Final Solution:
#############
|             |      1       |       2         |   3     |   4     |

| Job         | doctor        | electrician       | police-officer | coach   |
#############
Explanation:
1. Coach is not in position 1 or 5 (far left and far right).
2. Doctor doesn't drink sprite.
3. Electrician is to the left of hot chocolate, or they are in adjacent positions.
4. Fanta is in an odd position: 1, 3, or 5.
5. Hot chocolate is to the left of doctor.
6. Person drinking fanta cannot be in even positions: 2, 4.
7. Coach is on far left or far right, so they are in position 1 or 5.
8. Electrician is somewhere to the left of police-officer, meaning electrician's position is less than police-officer's position.

After applying all these conditions, the final solution table has been created with '#############' around it."
