Now, applying the given conditions:

1. The person who's hobby is singing (Person 2) is somewhere to the right of the journalist (Person 2).

Since we have Person 2 as both a journalist and someone whose hobby is singing, this condition is already met.

2. The person watching fantasy movies is not the owner of the rabbit.

From the table, it's clear that the person who watches fantasy movies (Person 1) does not own the rabbit since Person 1 owns a cat.

3. The person who's hobby is singing is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit.

As mentioned in condition 2, the person with the singing hobby (Person 2) and the owner of the rabbit (also Person 2) are the same person.
