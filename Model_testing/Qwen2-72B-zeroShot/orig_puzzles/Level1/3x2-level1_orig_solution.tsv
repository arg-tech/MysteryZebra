Lv1-3x2-3	"Based on the given puzzle information:

1. The dressmaker is on the far left.
2. The person driving the tram is on the left of the owner of the mouse.

We can deduce the following:

- Dressmaker (Job) must be in the first column, either row 1 or row 2.
- Since the dressmaker is on the far left, Electrician (Job) will occupy the other two cells.
- Owner of Mouse (Pet) and Tram Driver (Transport) are related due to clue 2. The mouse owner will be one cell right from the tram driver.
- Owner of Pony (Pet) must be in the remaining cells.

Now, let's fill out the table accordingly:

With the given information, we can fill in the table as follows:

1. The person drinking tea rows (rule 1).
2. The American is to the right of the surfer (rule 2).

From this, we can infer that the Malayan must be on the left since there are two nationalities. Therefore, the喝茶 (Malaysian) surfs.

With these placements, we can fill in the remaining beverages and sports:

- The American drinks mirinda and rows.
- The Malaysian drinks tea and surfs.

From clue 1: the fan of punk is on the right of the person driving the train.

From clue 2: the person watching thriller movies is the person driving the taxi.

We can deduce that:

- Punk fan cannot be in position 1, as the person in position 1 (train driver) should be on the left of the punk fan.
- Therefore, the punk fan must be in position 2.
- The taxi driver watches thriller movies and is therefore also in position 2.
