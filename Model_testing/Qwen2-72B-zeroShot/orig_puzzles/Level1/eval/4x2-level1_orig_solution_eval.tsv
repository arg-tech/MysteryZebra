3. Clue 3 states that the person watching thriller movies is on the far left, which means they have the hobby of reading.

Lv1-4x2-9	"Based on the given information, we can construct the following table:

|             |      1       |     2      |
| Beverage    |   coffee     |    7up     |

| Hobby        | board-games   |   chess     |
| Job          | scientist      | teacher      |

Applying the rules:

1. The teacher is on the left of the person eating cucumber.
2. The person eating spinach is on the left of the person drinking coffee.
3. The teacher is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess.

From rule 1, we know that the teacher (Job: teacher) must be in column 1.

From rule 2, since the person eating spinach is on the left of the person drinking coffee, and both food and beverages are listed from top to bottom, this means that spinach must be in row 1, and coffee in row 2. This also means that cucumber (Food: cucumber) must be in column 2.

From rule 3, since the teacher is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess, and we already know that the teacher is in column 1, this means that chess (Hobby: chess) must be in row 2. This also means that board-games (Hobby: board-games) must be in column 2.

Now, putting it all together:

|             |      1       |     2      |
| Beverage    |   coffee     |    7up     |
