The final solution is not provided in a tabular format. Instead, the given puzzle consists of 26 statements that relate people's hobbies, jobs, food preferences, movie genres, sports, and means of transportation.

To solve this puzzle, one would need to interpret each statement and arrange the information accordingly. The final solution table would include all the connections between the different categories.

As an AI language model, I can help you understand individual statements or provide guidance on how to approach solving such puzzles. However, due to the complexity and open-ended nature of this specific puzzle, I am unable to provide a complete tabular solution."
