Explanation:

1. The person watching disaster movies is either not a fan of jazz or not into Sudoku, and both could be true.
2. The person watching adventure movies is to the left of the writer.
3. The person watching horror movies and the hiker have different parity positions (i.e., they are not both odd or both even in their positions).
4. The collector is to the left of the horror movie watcher.
5. The disaster movie watcher is not to the right of the writer.
6. The fan of pop music is not the disaster movie watcher.
7. The person watching disaster movies is on the right of the comedy movie watcher.
8. The hiker and the dubstep fan have the same parity positions.
9. The rock climber is on the far left, while the reggae fan is either to the right or the same position as the comedy movie watcher.

These deductions lead to the final solution table above."
