Lv12-7x7-5	"The given puzzle contains a series of clues related to people's favorite beverages, jobs, movie genres, nationalities, pets, sports, and types of transport. The clues also involve information about people's positions relative to each other.

To solve this puzzle, you would typically follow these steps:

1. **Organize the Clues**: Separate the clues into categories based on the information they provide (e.g., beverage preferences, job roles).

2. **Analyze the Clues**: Look for patterns and connections between the clues. This may involve identifying people with specific traits or placing them in a particular order.

3. **Construct the Solution Grid**: Create a table with rows representing each person and columns representing each category (e.g., beverage, job). Fill in the cells based on your analysis of the clues.

4. **Check for Consistency**: After filling in the solution grid, review your work to ensure that all the clues are satisfied simultaneously.

5. **Finalize the Solution Table**: Surround the final solution table with '#############' to indicate its completion.
