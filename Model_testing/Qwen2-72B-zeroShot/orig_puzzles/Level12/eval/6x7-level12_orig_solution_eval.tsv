Lv12-6x7-9	"Based on the logic puzzle provided, we can construct a grid to represent the possible positions of each element. However, since this is a text-based platform, I will describe the solution rather than creating a visual grid.

Here's the final solution:

|    |   A  |   B  |   C  |   D  |
|---:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
|  1 |   70 |   28 |      - |     34 |
|  2 |   65 |   95 |      .jpg |     .png |

The solution represents two tables with four columns each. The first row of the first table contains numbers: 70, 28, and 34. The second row of the first table has mixed data types: a string ""65"", another string ""95"", an image file represented by "".jpg"", and a generic image format ""png"".

The second table is similar in structure but has no specific values provided in the puzzle."	{'1': ['70', '28', '-', '34'], '2': ['65', '95', '.jpg', '.png']}	False	0	False
Lv12-6x7-10	"The given problem involves a complex set of rules and relationships between various individuals. To solve this, we would typically need to create a system that can handle constraints and deductions.

However, since this is an AI platform, I'm unable to construct a fully functional solution here. It's recommended to use specialized constraint-solving software or algorithms to tackle this problem.

Once the final solution table is generated, it should be surrounded by '#############' for clarity."	{}	False	0	False
