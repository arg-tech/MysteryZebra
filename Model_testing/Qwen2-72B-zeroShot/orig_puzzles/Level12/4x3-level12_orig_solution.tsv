Some notes on how the puzzle led to this solution:

1. The Beverage column was given directly.
2. The order of coffee and soy-milk in the Beverage column, combined with rules 5 and 6, determined the Food and Music-Genre columns.
3. Rules 9 and 10 helped confirm the positions of fan classical and fan trance.
4. Rule 13 confirmed the position of coffee in relation to the fan classical.
