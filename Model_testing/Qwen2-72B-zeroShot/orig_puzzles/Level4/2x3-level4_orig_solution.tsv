Lv4-2x3-5	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step:

1. Gardening is between Camping and Canadian.
2. Chess is in an odd position.
3. Dutch is on the left of Canadian.

From statement 1, we can start with:
|                |     1      |     2      |    3      |
| Hobby          | camping     | chess       | gardening  |

Now, from statement 2, Chess must be in an odd position. So we move it to the middle:
|                |     1      |     2      |    3      |
| Hobby          | camping     | gardening   | chess      |

From statement 3, Dutch is on the left of Canadian. Since Nationality isn't specified yet, let's place them based on the given information:

|                |     1      |     2      |    3      |
| Nationality   | dutch      | canadian    | colombian |

Now we can combine both tables to get the final solution:
#############
|                |     1      |     2      |    3      |

Lv4-2x3-8	"Based on the given information, we can deduce the positions as follows:

1. Artichoke is at position 3.
2. The owner of the snake is in an odd position, which could be either position 1 or 5 (not available in this table).
3. The owner of the rat is on the left of the person eating kale. This means that kale is to the right of rat's owner, which could be positions 2 or 4.

Given these deductions, we can place the elements in the table as follows:
#############
|         |   1     |  2    |     3      |   4   |
| Food    |          | carrot | artichoke  | kale   |
| Pet     | rat  | frog  | snake |        |
#############
Since there are no positions beyond position 4 in this table, we cannot place '#############' around the final solution table. However, if you meant to represent the boundary of the given information, you can simply use horizontal bars (---) above and below the table:

---

|         |   1     |  2    |     3      |   4   |
|---------|----------|--------|-------------|--------|
| Food    |          | carrot | artichoke  | kale   |
| Pet     | rat's owner | frog's owner | snake's owner |        |

---

Please note that without additional information, we cannot determine the specific positions of the pet owners or the exact ordering of the food items within their respective positions."
