Based on the given puzzle:

1. The person with a hobby of video-games is in an even position (either 1 or 2). Therefore, the owner of the hamster, who is in an odd position, cannot be in position 1.

2. Since the paramedic is on the left of the person driving the car, and the paramedic is also on the left or right of the journalist##3, we can conclude that the journalist must drive the car, as they are both on the same side of the paramedic.

With these deductions, we fill in the positions accordingly:
