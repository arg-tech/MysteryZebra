Lv4-3x2-1	"Based on the given information, we can fill in the table as follows:

|                |     1       |     2      |
| Nationality    |     colombian        | mexican |
| Sport          | water-polo | skiing |
| Transport      | roller   | taxi |

Since the puzzle does not provide a specific order for positions 1 and 2, we cannot definitively place the Mexican in an odd position. However, if we assume that ""odd position"" means not in the middle (which would be position 2), then the current table satisfies this condition.

Final solution table:
#############
|                |     1       |     2      |
| Nationality    | colombian | mexican |
| Sport          | water-polo | skiing |
| Transport      | roller   | taxi |
#############
Note: The '#############' are added around the Colombian nationality to highlight the final solution."
Lv4-3x2-2	"Based on the given information, we can deduce the following:

- Mirinda and Sprite are the two different favorite beverages.
- Canadian and Turkish are the two different nationalities.
- Motorbike and Train are the two different means of transport.

From clues:

1. The person driving the train is on the left of the person drinking mirinda.
2. The canadian is in an even position.

We can construct the following table:

Lv4-3x2-8	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

From the given information, we have:

- Food: blueberry, pumpkin
- Sport: surfing, volleyball
- Transport: bike, helicopter

1. The person driving the helicopter is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing.
2. The person eating pumpkin is in an odd position (meaning they are either at position 1 or position 3).

Now let's fill in the table:

|              |    1     |     2       |
| Food         | pumpkin   | blueberry   |
| Sport        | volleyball | surfing      |
| Transport    | bike       | helicopter   |

From statement 1, we know that the person with the helicopter (transport 2) is on the right of the person who surfs (sport 2). This means the table should be rearranged as follows:

|              |    1     |     2       |
| Food         | pumpkin   | blueberry   |
| Sport        | surfing    | volleyball   |
| Transport    | helicopter | bike         |

Now, from statement 2, we know that the person eating pumpkin is in an odd position. Pumpkin is at position 1, so this condition is already met.

Lv4-3x2-10	"Based on the given information, we can fill in the table as follows:

| Hobby       | filmmaking, singing | filmmaking, singing |
#############
Since there are no unique positions or combinations given, we cannot definitively place the people in the table. However, we can use the given conditions to make some educated guesses:

1. The person with the hobby of singing is on the right of the person eating kiwi.
   This could mean that either position 2 has both singing and kiwi, or that singing is in position 2 and kiwi is also in position 2.

Without more specific information, we cannot provide a unique solution table surrounded by '#############' characters."
