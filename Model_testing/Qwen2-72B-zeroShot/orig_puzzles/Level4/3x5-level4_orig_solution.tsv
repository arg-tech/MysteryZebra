Here, the puzzle solutions have been used to place the corresponding elements in their respective positions. The '' after some elements indicates that they are placed on either the far left or far right of the table.

The '' after 'roller' indicates that this person is in an odd position. Similarly, '' after 'bike' indicates that the fan of salsa is the person driving the bike, as mentioned in clue #5."
