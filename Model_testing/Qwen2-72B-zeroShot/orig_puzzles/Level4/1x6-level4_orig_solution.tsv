Lv4-1x6-1	"Based on the given information, we can fill out the table as follows:

```
#############
|                | 1     | 2      | 3     | 4     | 5      | 6      |
| Music-Genre    | folk   | house   | rock   | soul   | gospel  | disco   |
#############
```

Explanation:
1. House fan is either left or right of the Disco fan (position 6), but we don't have enough information to determine their exact positions.
2. The Rock fan is on the left of the Folk fan, so Folk must be in an odd position (positions 1, 3, 5). Since we know that the House fan is in an odd position and either left or right of Disco, it can only occupy position 5 (since house cannot be next to disco). This means that Folk is in position 1.
3. The House fan is on the right of the Folk fan (position 1), so House must be in position 5.
4. The Gospel fan is on the left of the Rock fan, but since we know the positions for Rock and Folk, Gospel must be in position 6.
5. All remaining music-genres can be filled accordingly: Disco in position 2, Soul in position 4, and Gospel in position 6.

Final solution table:

```
|                | 1     | 2      | 3     | 4     | 5      | 6      |
| Music-Genre    | folk   | house   | rock   | soul   | gospel  | disco   |
