Lv4-1x3-4	"Based on the given puzzle:

1. The fan of jazz is in an odd position (implies that the fan of jazz is in either position 1 or 3).
2. The fan of techno is on the left of the fan of jazz.

Let's fill in the positions based on these rules:

|                |    1     |   2     |  3    |
| Music-Genre    |          |         |       |

Techno is to the left of Jazz, and Jazz can be either in position 1 or 3. Since Jazz is in an odd position, we place it at position 3.

|                |    1     |   2     |  3    |
| Music-Genre    |          |         |       |

Techno is still to the left of Jazz:

|                |    1     |   2     |  3    |
| Music-Genre    | Techno   |         | Jazz  |
  
Now, we have Country music-genre left. Since it's not mentioned in any rule, it can be placed anywhere. Let's place it at position 2:

|                |    1     |   2     |  3    |
| Music-Genre    | Techno   | Country  | Jazz  |

Lv4-1x3-5	"Based on the given puzzle:

1. Onion is left of papaya.
2. Onion is in an odd position.

Since there are only three positions, and onion must be in an odd position, it can only be in position 1 or position 3.

If onion was in position 1, then papaya would have to be in position 3 (since onion is left of papaya). This leaves position 2 for kiwi.

Solution table:

Lv4-1x3-10	"Based on the given puzzle:

1. The person eating pepper is to the left of the person eating papaya.
2. The person eating papaya is in an even position.

Let's fill in the positions based on these rules:

- Papaya must be in either position 2 or 4.
- If papaya is in position 2, then pepper must be in position 1 (to the left of papaya). However, this would violate rule 1 because pepper wouldn't be to the left of papaya if papaya were in position 2.
- Therefore, papaya must be in position 4. This means that the person eating papaya is on the right side of the table.
- With papaya in position 4, the person eating pepper can only be in position 3 (to the left of papaya), satisfying rule 1.
- Finally, plum is the remaining food type and must go in position 2.

The final solution table looks like this:

```
