Lv4-4x2-5	"Based on the given information, we can fill in the table as follows:

```
#############
|                |       1        |     2       |
| Beverage       |      milk       | hot-#chocolate|
| Job            |    engineer      |   dancer      |
| Movie-Genre    |    mystery       |  disaster      |
| Pet            |     chinchilla   |    frog       |
#############
```

However, there seems to be an inconsistency in the puzzle. Rule number 3 states that the engineer is in an odd position. But based on rule 2, both owners of frogs are in even positions (since they can't be in odd positions). This means the engineer cannot have a pet frog.

Therefore, we need to make an assumption or revise the puzzle if it contains errors. For the purpose of this answer and given no other information, let's assume that the engineer does not own a frog. This leaves two possibilities for the engineer's pet: chinchilla or frog.

With these assumptions in place, we can now create the final solution table:

```
