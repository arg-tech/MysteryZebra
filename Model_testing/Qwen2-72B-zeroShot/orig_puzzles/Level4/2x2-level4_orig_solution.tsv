Lv4-2x2-7	"Based on the given information, we can deduce the following:

1. The journalist is in an even position (column 2).
2. The person with a gardening hobby is to the left of the journalist.

Now let's fill out the table step by step:

1. Since the journalist is in column 2:
```
|          |      1       |     2       |
| Hobby    |              |             |
| Job      |              |         J   |
```

2. The person with a gardening hobby is to the left of the journalist, which means they must be in row 1 and column 1.

```
|          |      1       |     2       |
| Hobby    | G            |             |
| Job      |              |         J   |
```

Now we can place the remaining information:

- The firefighter is in an odd position, so they must be in row 2 and column 1.
- Sudoku hobbyist can only be in row 1, column 2 or row 2, column 2 since those are the even positions left. Since the journalist is already in column 2 of row 2, the sudoku hobbyist must be in column 2 of row 1.

With these placements, our final table looks like this:

```
|          |      1       |     2       |
| Hobby    | G            |   Sudoku    |
| Job      |     F        |         J   |

Lv4-2x2-8	"Based on the given information, we can deduce the following:

1. The australian is to the left of the pakistani.
2. The owner of the frog (position #4) is in an odd position.

Let's start by placing the nationalities based on clue #2:

|                |     1       |     2      |
| Nationality    |     australian        |   pakistani  |


Now, let's consider clue #1. Since the owner of the frog (position #4) is in an odd position, this means that position #1 or #3 must be the owner of the frog.

Let's try placing the frog's owner in position #1:

|                |     1       |     2      |
| Nationality    |     australian        |   pakistani  |
| Pet            |     frog         |            |

But this placement would violate clue #2 because the pakistani would be to the left of the australian.

So, let's try placing the frog's owner in position #3:

|                |     1       |     2      |
| Nationality    |     australian        |   pakistani  |
| Pet            |            |   frog         |

This placement satisfies both clue #2 (the australian is to the left of the pakistani) and clue #1 (the owner of the frog, position #4, is in an odd position).

So the final solution table is:
#############
|                |     1       |     2      |
| Nationality    |     australian        |   pakistani  |
| Pet            |            |   frog         |
