Lv4-2x7-2	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The owner of the hedgehog (position 3 or 7) is in an odd position, so they must be at position 7.
2. The person watching comedy movies (also the owner of the hedgehog) is on the far left or far right (position 1 or 7), but we already placed them at position 7.
3. This contradiction means that the person watching comedy movies must actually be at position 1, which also means they are not the owner of the hedgehog.

Now let's fill in the known information:
