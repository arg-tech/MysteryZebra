Lv4-1x2-6	"The logic puzzle states that there are two different nationalities, Chinese and Mexican, and they are placed in the table.

1. The Mexican is in an even position, which means the Mexican must be in either position 2 or position 4 (since we only have positions 1-4).

Lv4-1x2-7	"Based on the puzzle:

1. The person who prefers water polo is in an odd position.
2. There are only two types of sports mentioned: skiing and water polo.

Let's denote the people by their positions, P1 for the first position, and so on.

If P1 plays water polo (an odd position), then according to the puzzle, P3 must play skiing, as there is no other option left. This leaves P2 to play water polo.

So the final solution table would be:
