 1. The person driving the skateboard is between the person watching romance movies and the person driving the helicopter.
 2. The person watching musical movies is the person driving the train.
 3. The pattern for positions related to multiple conditions is consistent across the puzzle, so there's no need to include additional notes for these conditions (##3).
 4. The person driving the skateboard is in an even position, which means they are either in the second or fourth position.
