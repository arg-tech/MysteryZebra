Note: The puzzle has conflicting statements about the position of the quad-bike. Statement 3 says it's in an odd position, while statement 5 says it's in the middle. In this solution, I have chosen to place the quad-bike in the middle (position 3), as this is a more specific instruction than being in an odd position."	{'transport': ['van', 'quad-bike', 'skateboard', 'train', '']}	True	0	False

Lv4-1x5-7	"Based on the given logic puzzle, we can fill in the table as follows:

```
#############
|        |   1   |     2       |   3    |    4      |    5     |
| Pet    | FISH   |             |        | GOLD       |          |
#############
```

Explanation:
1. The owner of the guinea-pig is between the owner of the fish and the owner of the horse, but there are no other pets mentioned, so we cannot place the guinea-pig's owner in the table.
2. The owner of the goldfish is in an even position, so it must be in either position 2 or 4. Since the fish is already in position 1, the goldfish goes in position 4.
3. The owner of the fish is on the far left, which corresponds to position 1.

Therefore, the final solution table surrounded by '#############' is:

```

Lv4-1x5-8	"Based on the given puzzle, we can deduce the positions of music-genre fans as follows:

1. The fan of soul must be between the fans of rock and classical (because of rules 2 and 3).

2. Since the fan of classical is in an even position (rule 4), it cannot be in position 1 or 5.

Now, let's fill out the table accordingly:

Lv4-1x5-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step:

1. Kiwi is to the right of Watermelon.
2. Zucchini is on the far left or far right.
3. Lemon is to the right of Peach.
4. Kiwi is to the right of Lemon.
5. Lemon is to the left or right of Peach.
6. Kiwi is in an even position.

From these clues, we can build the table:
