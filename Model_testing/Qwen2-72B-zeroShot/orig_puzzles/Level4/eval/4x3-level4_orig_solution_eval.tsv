Lv4-4x3-3	"Based on the given information, we can fill out the table as follows:

| Transport      | bike         | train    | quad-bike  |

Now, applying the given clues:

1. The owner of the turtle (cranberry eater) is on the right of the person driving the bike. This means that the cranberry eater cannot be in position 2, as they would then be left of the bike driver.

2. The person eating watermelon is the person driving the train. This means that the watermelon eater must be in position 3.

With these clues, we can fill out the positions:
#############
|                |     1       |   2     |     3      |
| Food           | carrot       | cranberry| watermelon |

| Transport      | bike         | train    | quad-bike  |
#############
Now, applying the remaining clues:

3. The person eating cranberry is on the left or right of the owner of the bird. Since we already have the cranberry eater in position 2 and the bird owner in position 1, this clue does not affect our current table.

4. The person eating carrot is between the person watching adventure movies and the person driving the train. We can place the carrot eater (position 1) because the adventure movie watcher is in position 1 or 3, and the train driver is always in position 3.

So, our final table looks like this:

Lv4-4x3-5	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue #2:
- The person drinking water is on the left of the person drinking juice.
So, we can represent this as:

|    |      |
|----|------|
| W  | J    |

From clue #7:
- The polish is in the middle.
So, Nationality must be:

|    |   Polish  |    |
|----|------------|----|
|    |            |    |

Now let's fill in the other known positions.

From clue #4:
- The bartender is in an odd position.
Since we have the polish in the middle, the only remaining odd position is at the far right. So,

|    |   Polish  |    |
|----|------------|----|
|    |            | B  |

From clue #6:
- The police-officer is on the right of the person drinking juice.
We know that J is to the right of W, but we don't yet know their positions relative to other elements. Let's continue with the remaining clues.

From clue #1:
- The manager is on the left of the german.
Since the polish is in the middle, and the bartender is at the far right, there are only two positions left for the German. If the manager were on the very left, there would be no place for the German, so the manager must be to the right of the German:

|    |   Polish  |    |
|----|------------|----|
| G  |            | M  |

From clue #5:
- The police-officer is on the left or right of the fan of salsa.
We haven't placed the salsa fan yet, but we know that there's a police officer to the right of the person drinking juice. This means that the only remaining position for the police-officer is between the german and the polish:

|    |   Polish  |    |
|----|------------|----|
| G  | P          | M  |

From clue #3:
- The bartender is in an odd position.
We have already placed the bartender at the far right, which is indeed an odd position.

Now we have filled in all positions:

|    |   Polish  |    |
|----|------------|----|
| G  | P          | M  |
| W  | J    |
|    |            | B  |
