Lv4-1x4-1	"Based on the given puzzle:

1. The Russian must be in position 3 or position 5 (odd positions).
2. The Turkish is between the German and the Russian, which means the Turkish is either in position 2 (if the Russian is in position 4) or in position 4 (if the Russian is in position 5).
3. The Turkish is on the right of the German. Since the Turkish is also between the German and the Russian, this means the German must be in position 1.

Now let's fill out the table:

|                |   1     |    2     |    3     |  4    |
| Nationality    |  german  |          |          |       |

Since we have a fixed position for the German, we can deduce the positions of the other nationalities based on the given clues.

- The Russian must be in an odd position and cannot be in position 1 (because that is where the German is). Therefore, the Russian can only be in position 3 or position 5.
- The Turkish is between the German and the Russian. This means the Turkish could be either in position 2 if the Russian is in position 4; or in position 4 if the Russian is in position 5.
- The Turkish is on the right of the German, which we have already taken into account when considering the positions for the Turkish.

With these considerations, let's fill out the remaining positions:

|                |   1     |    2     |    3     |  4    |
| Nationality    |  german  |  turkish  |  russian  |       |

Now we can put '#############' around the final solution table:

Lv4-1x4-3	"Based on the given logic puzzle, we can deduce the positions of the movie-genres as follows:

1. Mystery is between Zombie and Martial-Arts.
2. Drama is in an odd position (1 or 3).
3. Drama is not adjacent to Zombie because then it would violate rule #2 (Drama would be in an even position between two other genres).

Given these deductions, we can construct the final solution table:

```
|                |   1    |   2     |    3     |      4        |

Lv4-1x4-5	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

1. Handball is in an even position (2, 4).
2. Sailing is on the right of handball.
3. Lacrosse is on the left or right of sailing.

From statement 1, we know that handball must be in either position 2 or position 4.

From statement 2, since handball can only be in even positions, sailing must be in an odd position directly to the right of handball.

From statement 3, lacrosse is on the left or right of sailing. Since sailing must be in an odd position (and we already know that handball is to its left), lacrosse must be in the position immediately to the left of sailing.

Now let's fill in the table:
