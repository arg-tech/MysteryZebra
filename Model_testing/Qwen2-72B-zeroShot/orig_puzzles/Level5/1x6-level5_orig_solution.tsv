Lv5-1x6-1	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The airplane is on the far right.
2. The boat (even position) must be in one of these positions: 2, 4.
3. The snowmobile (even position) must also be in one of these positions: 2, 4.
4. Since both the boat and the snowmobile cannot occupy the same position, we can deduce that:
   - If the boat is at 2, the snowmobile is at 4.
   - If the boat is at 4, the snowmobile is at 2.

5. The subway must be to the left of the bus (but not necessarily in a lower position). This means they could be in positions 1-2 or 3-4.

6. Now we can determine the positions of the airplane and the subway:
   - The airplane is on the far right, so it's in position 6.
   - Since the subway must be to the left of the bus, and the airplane is already in position 6, the subway must be in position 1.

7. With the airplane and subway positions fixed, we can now place the boat and snowmobile based on the deductions from points 4 and 5:
   - The bus cannot be in position 1 (subway) or 6 (airplane), so it's either in position 2 or 3.
   - If the bus is in position 3, then the subway (position 1) is to its left. This allows the boat and snowmobile to occupy positions 2 and 4, respectively.
   - If the bus is in position 2, the subway (position 1) would still be to its left. However, this arrangement would not allow for both the boat and the snowmobile to be in even positions.

8. Therefore, with these deductions, we can construct the final solution table:

Lv5-1x6-6	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

1. Lettuce - peas (left)
2. Broccoli - peas (right)
3. Pepper - even position
4. Spinach - broccoli (left or right)
5. Peas - lettuce (right)
6. Lettuce - spinach (left)

From 1, 5 and 6, we can determine the positions of lettuce, peas, and spinach:

- Lettuce: 2nd or 3rd position
- Spinach: left of lettuce, so 1st or 2nd position
- Peas: right of lettuce, so 4th or 5th position

From 2 and 4, we know that broccoli is either to the right of peas or to the left of spinach:

- If broccoli is right of peas, it would be in the 6th position.
- If broccoli is left of spinach, it would be in the 1st position.

However, if broccoli were in the 1st position, then spinach would have to be in the 2nd position. But we already established that spinach must be either in the 1st or 2nd position and left of lettuce. Therefore, spinach cannot be directly left of broccoli.

As a result, broccoli must be right of peas and therefore in the 6th position. This also means that spinach is in the 1st position, since it's to the left of lettuce (which we'll determine next).

Now that we've placed spinach and broccoli, we can determine the position of lettuce:

- If lettuce were in the 2nd position, then spinach would be directly left of lettuce. However, we already established that spinach must be either in the 1st or 2nd position but to the left of lettuce (which is now in the 1st position). Therefore, lettuce cannot be in the 2nd position.
- If lettuce were in the 3rd position, then it would satisfy our condition that it's somewhere to the left of spinach. Therefore, lettuce must be in the 3rd position.

Now we can determine the positions of the remaining vegetables:

- Since broccoli is in the 6th position and to the right of peas, peas must be in the 5th position.
- Lettuce is in the 3rd position. To its left are spinach (1st) and cucumber (2nd).
- Spinach is in the 1st position, lettuce is in the 3rd position, so pepper must be in an even position between them. Therefore, pepper is in the 4th position.

Now we can fill in the table:

|         |    1     |  2    |    3      |    4     |    5      |   6     |  
| Food    | spinach   | cucumber| lettuce    | pepper    | peas       | broccoli |
