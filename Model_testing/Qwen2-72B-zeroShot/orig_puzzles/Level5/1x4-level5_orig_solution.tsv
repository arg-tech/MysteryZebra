Lv5-1x4-1	"Based on the given logic puzzle, we can deduce the positions as follows:

1. Airplane -> Helicopter -> Taxi
2. Airplane -> Ship -> ???
3. Airplane -> Taxi -> Helicopter

From points 1 and 3, we know that the helicopter is between the airplane and the taxi.

Now, combining this information with point 2, we can deduce the final positions:

1. Taxi (leftmost)
2. Airplane
3. Ship
4. Helicopter (rightmost)

The movie genres are arranged as follows, based on the given clues:
1. Crime (2) is between Scientific (3) and Epic (1).
2. Scientific (3) is to the left of Action (4), which means Action (4) must be on the far right.
3. Scientific (3) is somewhere to the right of Epic (1). Since Scientific (3) is already between Epic (1) and Crime (2), this clue doesn't change the arrangement."

Lv5-1x4-8	"Let's solve this puzzle step by step:

1. From rule 3, the boat driver must be in an odd position. This means positions 1, 3, or 5.

2. From rule 2, the boat driver is on the right of the train driver. Since the boat driver can only be in odd positions, the train driver must be in an even position directly to the left of the boat driver's position. The only such combination with an odd position for the boat driver is if the boat driver is in position 1 (with the train driver in position 2), or if the boat driver is in position 5 (with the train driver in position 4).

3. From rule 1, we know that the roller driver is on the left or right of the boat driver. If the boat driver is in position 1, then the roller driver must be in position 2, directly to the right of the boat driver's position (not allowed by rule 1). Therefore, this combination for positions 1 and 2 is not valid.

4. Now let's consider the case where the boat driver is in position 5, with the train driver in position 4. If the roller driver were directly to the left of the boat driver (in position 3), then the only remaining transport would be the bike, which would have nowhere to go since it must be somewhere to the left of the boat driver (rule 4). This situation is not valid.

5. Since the roller driver cannot be directly to the left of the boat driver, this means that the roller driver must be in position 3 or position 1 if the boat is in position 5. In either case, the bike driver can only be in positions 2 or 4 (rule 4).

Now we have all the information needed to fill out the table:
#############
|              |  1    |   2    |  3    |   4     |

Lv5-1x4-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person with puzzles is to the right of the one with traveling.
2. The person with traveling is to the left of the one with magic-tricks.

From these two statements, we can deduce that the order from left to right must be: hiking, magic-tricks, traveling, puzzles.

Now let's fill in the table:
