Lv5-4x4-9	"Based on the given puzzle, we can fill out the table as follows:

|                |    1     |     2      |    3      |     4       |
| Food           | cabbage   | cucumber    | lime       | onion        |

| Transport      | jet-ski   | motorbike   | scooter    | skateboard     |

Now, let's apply the constraints to finalize the solution:

1. & 4: The person eating lime is in an even position, so they must be in position 2 or 4.
2. The person watching zombie movies is on the left or right of the person eating lime.

3. The person driving the jet-ski is between the person watching musical movies and the person eating cucumber.

From constraint 3, we know that the positions are as follows:
- musical: 1
- jet-ski: 2
- cucumber: 3

Since the person eating lime is in an even position (constraint 4), they must be in position 4. This means the person watching zombie movies is on the left of the person eating lime.

Now we can finalize the table:

|                |    1     |     2      |    3      |     4       |
