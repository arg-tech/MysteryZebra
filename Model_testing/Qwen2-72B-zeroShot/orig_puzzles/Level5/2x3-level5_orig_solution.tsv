Lv5-2x3-4	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step:

1. From clues 1 and 3, we know that plum is between corn and biathlon. Since biathlon is in the middle, this means plum is on the left side of the middle, and corn is to its right.

2. Golf must be either to the left or the right of soccer. But from clue 4, corn is to the right of golf. So, golf must be to the left of soccer.

Now we can fill in the table:

|          |   1     |    2      |   3     |
| Food     |  tomato  |   plum     |  corn    |

Lv5-2x3-8	"Based on the given puzzle, we can fill in the table as follows:

|          |    1     |    2      |     3      |
| Hobby    |  baking   | drawing    | reading     |
| Job      | designer   | fisherman  | pilot       |

The puzzle clues indicate the following relationships:

1. The person with the hobby of drawing is on the left of the fisherman.

This clue places the fisherman to the right of the person who draws, which means the drawing hobby must be in column 2.

2. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading.

This clue implies that the reading hobby should be placed either in column 1 or 3, with drawing in column 2. Since we've already determined drawing to be in column 2, this clue doesn't provide any new information.

3. The designer is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is reading.

This clue allows us to place the designer either to the left or the right of the reading hobby. However, since the designer cannot be placed in column 1 (as they would then be to the left of the fisherman, which violates clue 4), we can conclude that the designer must be in column 3.

With this information, we can now finalize the table:
#############
|          |    1     |    2      |     3      |
| Hobby    |  baking   | drawing    | reading     |
