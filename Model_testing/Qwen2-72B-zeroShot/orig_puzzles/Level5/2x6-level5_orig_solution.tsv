The puzzle solution is embedded in the table."
Lv5-2x6-8	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

From clues:

1. The person drinking soy-milk is next to someone whose sport is cricket.
2. The person who plays golf is between the person playing volleyball and the person sailing.
3. The person drinking tea is in an odd position, meaning they are either 1st, 3rd, or 5th.

Now we can start filling in the table:

|             |    1      |     2       |    3     |    4      |    5     |      6       |
| Beverage    |           |             |          |           |          |              |
| Sport       |           |             |          |           |          |              |

Using clues 1, 3, and 12 we can place tea in the odd position (let's say it's position 5 for now) and soy-milk next to cricket. This gives us:

|             |    1      |     2       |    3     |    4      |    5     |      6       |
| Beverage    |           |             |          |           |   tea    |              |
| Sport       |           |             |          |           |           |              |

Now using clue 10, we can place climbing to the left of cricket. Then, from clue 2, we know that golf is between volleyball and sailing. This gives us:

|             |    1      |     2       |    3     |    4      |    5     |      6       |
| Beverage    |           |             |          |           |   tea    |              |
| Sport       | climbing   | cricket      | golf     | volleyball | sailing   |              |

Finally, we can fill in the remaining beverages using clues and ensuring that no two people have the same beverage or sport.

After filling in all the beverages:

|             |    1      |     2       |    3     |    4      |    5     |      6       |
| Beverage    | almond-   | juice        | lemonade | mirinda   | soy-     | tea           |
| Sport       | climbing   | cricket      | golf     | volleyball | sailing   |              |

Now, we put '#############' around the final solution table:
