Lv5-1x3-4	"Based on the given puzzle:

|                |    1      |     2       |   3     |
| Movie-Genre    |           |             |         |

1. The thriller watcher is to the left of the scientific watcher.
2. The scientific watcher is to the left of the sports watcher.

From these two statements, we can deduce that:

- Scientific is at 1 (leftmost).
- Thriller is at 2 (to the left of scientific).
- Sports is at 3 (to the left of thriller).

Now, with the final solution:

Lv5-1x3-5	"Based on the given puzzle:

1. Watermelon is to the left of carrot.
2. Banana is between watermelon and carrot.

We can construct the following table:

|         |     1       |   2     |   3     |
| Food    |蕉###瓜####菜###蕉####瓜###菜| |
#############
Note that the puzzle does not specify the exact positions, only the relative order. Therefore, there could be multiple valid solutions with different arrangements within each group (banana, watermelon, carrot). The solution provided above is one such possible arrangement."
Lv5-1x3-6	"Based on the given logic puzzle, we can deduce the positions as follows:

1. The person drinking tea is either to the left or right of the person drinking milk. This leaves two possible configurations for tea and milk:
   - Tea...Milk
   - Milk...Tea

2. The person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the person drinking milk. This rules out the ""Milk...Tea"" configuration.

3. The person drinking milk is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking tea. Since we only have three beverages, this statement actually repeats the condition from clue 2.

After analyzing these clues, we can conclude that the final solution table is as follows:

```
#############
|             |  1   |  2    |   3    |
| Beverage    |          Juice| Milk | Tea   |

Please note that the table representation might be limited in the text format, but the positions of the beverages should be clear from the explanation above."
Lv5-1x3-7	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 1:
The owner of the hamster must be to the right of the rabbit owner. Let's represent this as follows:

|        |   1     |    2     |  3    |
| Pet    |         |          |       |
| Owner   | ??      | ??       | Rabbit |

From clue 2:
The hamster owner must be to the left of the goat owner. Since we don't have a specific position for the goat, let's assume that there are at least two owners to its right.

|        |   1     |    2     |  3    |
| Pet    |         |          |       |
| Owner   | ??      | Rabbit    | ??     |

Now we can fill in the pets based on their respective owners:

|        |   1     |    2     |  3    |
| Pet    | Goat     | Rabbit    | Hamster |
| Owner   | Leftmost | Middle    | Rightmost |

Finally, here is the solution table surrounded by '#############':
