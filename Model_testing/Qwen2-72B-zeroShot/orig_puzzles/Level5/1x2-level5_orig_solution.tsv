Lv5-1x2-3	"Based on the puzzle:

|                |      1       |     2      |
| Movie-Genre    |              |            |

Solution:

Since the time-travel movie watcher is to the left of the adventure movie watcher, we can place the time-travel genre in column 1, and adventure in column 2.

Final Solution Table:
#############
|                |      1       |     2      |

| malaysian        |      X     |    X     |

Since we know that the British is to the right of the Malaysian, we can place them accordingly. However, since there are two spots on either side of each nationality, both positions satisfy the given condition.

Final solution with '#############' around:
