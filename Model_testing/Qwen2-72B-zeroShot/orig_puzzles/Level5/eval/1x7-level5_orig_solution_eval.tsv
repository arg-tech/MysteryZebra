Lv5-1x7-2	"Solving this puzzle involves deducing the positions of each pet's owner based on the given rules.

Let's start by filling in the known relationships:

1. Guinea-Pig -> Right of Cat (rule #6)

Lv5-1x7-5	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

1. Gospel -> Dubstep (Right)
2. Gospel -> Metal (Right)
3. Gospel -> Metal (Right or Left)
4. Ambient in middle
5. Techno far left or far right

From statements 2 and 3, we can infer that Metal is either directly to the right of Gospel or one position to the right.

From statement 1, Gospel must be somewhere to the left of Dubstep, but not necessarily directly to the left.

Now let's place these in the table:

```

#############
```

Now, let's fill in the remaining genres based on their relative positions:

6. House -> Ambient (Left or Right)
7. Dubstep -> Ambient (Right)
8. Metal -> House (Left or Right)

From statement 6, we know that House is either directly to the left or right of Ambient.

Statement 7 tells us that Dubstep is directly to the right of Ambient.

Since Gospel is to the left of Dubstep, and Gospel is to the left of Metal, we can place Gospel in position 1. Now, let's finalize the table:

```

```

Now, let's fill in the remaining genres based on their relative positions:

6. House -> Ambient (Left or Right)
7. Dubstep -> Ambient (Right)
8. Metal -> House (Left or Right)

From statement 6, we know that House is either directly to the left or right of Ambient.

Statement 7 tells us that Dubstep is directly to the right of Ambient.

Since Gospel is to the left of Dubstep, and Gospel is to the left of Metal, we can place Gospel in position 1. Now, let's finalize the table:

```
|                |   1     |   2    |   3    |    4     |    5     |   6     |   7     |

| Ambient             | X       | X      | X      |          |          |         |         |
| Metal              | X       | X      | X      |          |          |         |         |
| House               |         |        |        |          |          |         |         |
| Techno              |         |        |        |          |          |         |         |

```

Since Gospel is in position 1, Dubstep must be directly to its right, in position 2. This also means that Ambient must be in position 3.

Now we have:

- Gospel in position 1
- Dubstep in position 2
- Ambient in position 3
- Metal on the right of Gospel (positions 1 and 2)
- House is either directly to the left or right of Ambient

Since Gospel is to the left of Metal, we can place Metal in position 4.

Now let's fill in the remaining genres based on their relative positions:

6. House -> Ambient (Left or Right)
7. Dubstep -> Ambient (Right)

From statement 6, we know that House is either directly to the left or right of Ambient. Since there are no more positions to the left of Ambient, House must be directly to the right of Ambient.

Now we have:

- Gospel in position 1
- Dubstep in position 2
- Ambient in position 3
- Metal in position 4
- House in position 5

Finally, let's place Techno and Trance. From statement 8, we know that Metal is either directly to the left or right of House.

Since there are no more positions to the right of House, this means that Metal must be directly to the left of House.

Now, Techno can be placed in position 6 (to the left of House), and Trance can be placed in position 7 (to the right of Ambient).

The final table is:

```
