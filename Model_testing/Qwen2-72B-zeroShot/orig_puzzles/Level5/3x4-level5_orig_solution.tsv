Explanation:
1. The German is to the right of the paramedic, so we place ""german"" in column 4.
2. The Brazilian is to the left of the French, so we place ""brazilian"" in column 1 and ""french"" in column 3.
3. The paramedic is on the left or right of the German, which we have already established.
4-9. These clues confirm and solidify our initial placements.
