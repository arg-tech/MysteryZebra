Now, applying rules 1 and 2:

1. The person watching documentary movies is not to the left of the person driving the helicopter.
Since documentaries are in column 1, the helicopter must also be in column 1. Therefore, we can swap the helicopter and quad-bike.

From clue #8, we know that the owner of the hamster is not to the right of the owner of the goat. Since there are only two positions, this means the owner of the goat is in position 1 and the owner of the hamster is in position 2.

From clue #4, we know that the person eating pomegranate is in an odd position. This means the person eating pomegranate must be in position 1.
