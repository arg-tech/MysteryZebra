Lv8-4x3-6	"Based on the given information, we can deduce the following:

1. The designer is either British or Canadian (from clues 3 and 4).
2. The owner of the goldfish cannot be to the left of the Canadian (from clue 8). This means that the designer (who is the Canadian) must own the goldfish.
3. Using clue 5, we can place the dressmaker between the musician and someone drinking coffee or juice.
4. Clues 6 and 7 together imply that the Indonesian is on the left of both the owner of the hamster and the person drinking lemonade.
