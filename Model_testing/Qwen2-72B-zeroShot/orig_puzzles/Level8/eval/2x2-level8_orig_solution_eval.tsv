1. The cycling person cannot be in the first position (leftmost) if the soy-milk drinker is not in the second position.
2. However, the cycling person must be to the right of the soy-milk drinker.

From clues:
1. The person eating cabbage is not to the left of the fan of r&b.
2. The person eating peach is on the left of the fan of r&b.

Combining these clues, we place the person who likes r&b in the middle (as there are only 2 positions), which makes the final solution:
