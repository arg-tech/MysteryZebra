Lv8-1x5-2	"Based on the given puzzle:

1. Sudoku is to the left of magic-tricks.
2. Traveling is not between singing and magic-tricks, as it would be in the middle otherwise.
3. Singing is next to photography.

Lv8-1x5-3	"Based on the given information, we can construct the following table:

|                |    1     |    2     |  3   |   4    |   5     |
| Music-Genre    |          |          |      |        |         |
| ambient           |          |          |      |        |         |
| hip-hop           |          |          |      |        |         |
| house              |          |          |      |        |         |
| pop                |          |          |      |        |         |
| techno             |          |          |      |        |         |

The puzzle states that the fans of certain music genres are located in specific positions relative to each other.

Let's denote the fans as follows:
- A: ambient
- H: hip-hop
- P: pop
- T: techno

Now, let's fill in the table based on the given information:

1. The fan of house is somewhere to the left of the fan of techno.
   - Place T between 4 and 5 (techno can't be at position 5 because of clue #5).
   - Now place H anywhere to the left of T.

2. The fan of pop is between the fan of hip-hop and the fan of house.
   - Since we have not placed P yet, it can only go between H and H (since H is to the right of P by clue #4)).
   
3. The fan of hip-hop is somewhere between the fan of ambient and the fan of techno.
   - This information doesn't restrict the current positions of A, H, T, so we don't need to make any changes.

4. The fan of pop is somewhere to the left of the fan of house.
   - As mentioned in clue #2, P is already placed between H and H.

5. The fan of techno is not to the left of the fan of house.
   - This information does not conflict with our current table setup, so no changes are needed.

Now that we have filled in the table based on the given clues:

|                |    1     |    2     |  3   |   4    |   5     |
| Music-Genre    |          |          |      |        |         |
| ambient           |          |          | A    |        |         |
| hip-hop           | H        | P        | P    | H      | T       |
| house              |          |          |      |        | H       |
| pop                | P        | P        | P    | H      |         |
| techno             |          |          |      |        | T       |
