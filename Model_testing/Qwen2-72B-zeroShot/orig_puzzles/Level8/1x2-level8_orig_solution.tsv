Lv8-1x2-1	"Here's the solved puzzle table:

```
|                |  1    |  2   |
| Music-Genre    |        |       |
| funk              |  ##### |  ###  |
| d&b               |  #     | ##### |

```

The fans are arranged as follows:
- The fan of funk is in position 1 (left).
- The fan of d&b is to the left of the fan of funk, so it's also in position 1.
- The fan of d&b is on the right of the fan of funk, so the fan of funk must be in position 2.

Thus, the table is surrounded by '#############'."

The person watching musical movies is on the far right (in column 2), and they are not to the left of the person watching satire movies, who is in column 1."
Lv8-1x2-3	"Based on the given puzzle, we can fill in the table as follows:

|        |    1      |    2      |
| Pet    | Goldfish   | Hedgehog   |

From clue 1, we know that the owner of goldfish (Pet 1) is to the left of the hedgehog's owner (Pet 2). This is already satisfied by the table.

From clue 2, we know that the owner of the hedgehog (Pet 2) is on either the left or right of the goldfish's owner (Pet 1). Since Pet 1 is to the left of Pet 2, this condition is also met.

From clue 3, it seems like there might be a typo since it states that ""the owner of the goldfish is not to the right of the owner of the goldfish"". This statement is redundant and doesn't provide any new information.

Given all these considerations, the final solution table remains unchanged:

|        |    1      |    2      |
| Pet    | Goldfish   | Hedgehog   |

surrounded by '#############':

```
#############
|        |    1      |    2      |
| Pet    | Goldfish   | Hedgehog   |

Lv8-1x2-6	"Based on the given logic puzzle, we can fill in the table as follows:

|        |    1      |  2   |
| Pet    | goldfish   | rat   |

According to clue 1, the owner of the goldfish is in an odd position, which means they are in position 1.

For clue 2, it states that the owner of the rat is not to the left of the owner of the rat. This implies that the owner of the rat cannot be in position 1 (since there's no one to their left). Therefore, the owner of the rat must be in position 2.

With all clues accounted for, the final solution table is:

|        |    1      |  2   |
| Pet    | goldfish   | rat   |

Surrounding it with '#############' gives:

```
#############
# goldfish  #
#     rat    #

Lv8-1x2-7	"Based on the given puzzle, we can deduce the following:

Since Train cannot be to the right of Jet-ski (Rule 2), Train must be to the left of Jet-ski.

Now, since there are only two means of transport and Train is to the left, Jet-ski must be in the second position.

Therefore, the final solution table is:

|              |   1    |    2     |
| Transport    |  Train  |Jet-ski   |
|               | ############# | ############# |

Note: The '#############' around the final solution table are not physically present in this text-based interface. In a visual representation, they would surround the table."
Lv8-1x2-8	"Based on the given puzzle, we can deduce that:

1. Chess is to the left of magic tricks.
2. Chess is not to the right of magic tricks.

This means chess must be in the middle column (2), and magic tricks must be in the rightmost column (3). Since there are only two hobbies, the table will look like this:

|          |   1    |      2        |
| Hobby    |        |               |
| chess     |  #####  |       #####      |
| magic-    |         |               |
| tricks    |  #####  |       #####      |

So the final solution, surrounded by '#############', is:

|          |   1    |      2        |
| Hobby    |  #####  |       #####      |
| chess     |  #####  |       #####      |
| magic-    |         |               |
| tricks    |  #####  |       #####      |

The hobby chess is in the middle column (2), and the hobby magic tricks is in the rightmost column (3)."
Lv8-1x2-9	"Based on the given puzzle:

There are two different types of food: asparagus and plum.

1. The person eating asparagus is on the right of the person eating plum.
2. The person eating asparagus is not to the left of the person eating asparagus (this actually just restates rule 1).

We can deduce that the table should look like this:

|         |   1    |     2      |
| Food    |  plum   |   asparagus |

Surrounding with '#############':
