Lv8-2x2-2	"Based on the given information, we can deduce the following:

1. The cycling person cannot be in the first position (leftmost) if the soy-milk drinker is not in the second position.
2. However, the cycling person must be to the right of the soy-milk drinker.

Given these deductions, we can construct the final solution table:

|             |    1      |    2     |
| Beverage    |   juice    | soy- milk |

|----------------|---------|-----------|
| Food           | cabbage | peach     |
| Music-Genre    | pop     | r&b      |

From clues:
1. The person eating cabbage is not to the left of the fan of r&b.
2. The person eating peach is on the left of the fan of r&b.

Combining these clues, we place the person who likes r&b in the middle (as there are only 2 positions), which makes the final solution:

|                |   1    |    2     |

Lv8-2x2-4	"Based on the given information, we can deduce the following:

1. Lime and potato are the two types of food.
2. Dog and fish are the two different pets.
3. There is a relationship between the pet owner (dog) and the person eating lime based on clues 1 and 2.

Now, let's fill in the table accordingly:

|         |   1     |  2    |
| Food    | potato   | lime   |
| Pet     | fish     | dog    |
