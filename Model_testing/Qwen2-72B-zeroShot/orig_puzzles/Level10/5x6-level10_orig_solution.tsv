Final Solution:
The puzzle provides information about the connections between people's food, hobbies, jobs, nationalities, and means of transport. The final solution cannot be represented in a single table due to the complexity of the interconnections.

Instead, one would need to construct a multi-dimensional model or use a graph database to represent all the relationships described by the puzzle statements.
