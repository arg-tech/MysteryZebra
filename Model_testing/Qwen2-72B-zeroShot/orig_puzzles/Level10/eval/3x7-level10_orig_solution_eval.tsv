We will continue this process, filling in more information as we go along. However, this process is quite extensive and would require multiple steps to complete accurately.

Instead of typing out all the intermediate steps, I recommend using a software tool specifically designed for solving logic puzzles like this one. Such tools often have features that allow you to input the given clues and then solve the puzzle step by step visually.
