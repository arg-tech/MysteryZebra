Lv7-1x3-1	"Based on the given puzzle:

1. The fan of metal is to the right of the fan of house.
2. The fan of metal is between the fan of house and the fan of jazz.

We can construct the following table as the solution:
#############
|                |   1    |   2    |  3    |  
| Music-Genre    | house   | jazz    | metal  |

Surrounding it with '#############':


The final solution is shown above."
Lv7-1x3-2	"Based on the given information, we can fill in the transport table as follows:

|              |   1   |   2   |   3   |
| Transport    |   #   |   #   |   #   |

1. The person driving the trike is somewhere between the person driving the train and the person driving the boat.

From this statement, we can infer that:

- Boat (B) must be on the far left.
- Trike (T) cannot be next to Boat or Train.
- Since Boat is fixed on the far left, Train (N) must be to the right of Boat.

With these deductions, our table now looks like this:

|              |   1   |   2   |   3   |
| Transport    |   B   |   #   |   #   |

1. The person driving the train is somewhere to the right of the person driving the boat.

From the previous deductions, we already know that Train must be to the right of Boat. Therefore, this statement does not give us any new information.

Our final solution table, with '#############' around it, looks like this:
#############
|              |   1   |   2   |   3   |
| Transport    |   B   |   T   |   N   |

Lv7-1x3-7	"Based on the given puzzle:

1. The entrepreneur must be in either job 2 or job 3, since they are to the right of the engineer.
2. The engineer can only be in job 1 (since it's between the entrepreneur and the manager) or job 2 (if the entrepreneur is in job 3).

Since we don't have enough information to determine whether the engineer is in job 1 or job 2, we will leave these cells blank for now.

Here's the final solution table with '#############' around it:

```
#############

Please note that the '####' indicates where the entrepreneur could be, but we don't know for sure. Similarly, the '#'s in the manager's column indicate a possible range for their position relative to the engineer and entrepreneur."

Lv7-1x3-10	"Based on the given puzzle:

1. The motorbike is left of the ship.
2. The motorbike is between the quad-bike and the ship.

However, we don't have enough information to place each transport in its respective column. We can only confirm the relative positions of the motorbike and the ship but not their exact columns or the position of the quad-bike.

Since there's no definitive solution, I cannot provide a table with '#############' around it. If you have more information or another puzzle piece, please let me know, and we can proceed from there."
