Lv7-2x3-6	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

1. The colombian is on the left or right of the japanese.
2. The japanese is somewhere to the left of the colombian.
3. The fan of jazz is on the right of the pakistani.
4. The fan of jazz is somewhere between the pakistani and the fan of blues.

From 1 and 2, we can deduce that the colombian and the japanese are adjacent, with the colombian to the left of the japanese.

From 3 and 4, we know the jazz fan is on the right of the pakistani and between the pakistani and the blues fan. This implies that the order from left to right must be: blues fan, pakistani, jazz fan.

Now we can fill in the table:

|                |     1      |    2      |     3      |
