#############  
  
  Explanation:

1. The person eating zucchini (3rd food) is not Spanish (3rd nationality). So, Spanish cannot be in the 3rd column.
2. The Brazilian (2nd nationality) is on the left or right of the Spanish (3rd nationality). Since Spanish cant be in the 3rd column due to rule 1, the Brazilian must also not be in the 3rd column.
3. The firefighter (2nd job) is on the left or right of the person whos sport is snowboarding (2nd sport). This means the person with snowboarding as their sport cannot be in the middle column either.
4. The person whos hobby is hiking (1st hobby) is on the left of the owner of the bird (1st pet). So, the person with hiking as a hobby must be in the 1st column, and the owner of the bird must be in the 2nd column.
5. The owner of the pony (2nd pet) is the dancer (1st job). This means that the dancer must be in the 2nd column, and the owner of the pony must also be in the 2nd column.
