Lv2-2x3-2	"Here's the completed puzzle table with '#############' around it:

```
#############
|     |     1       |       2        |       3        |
| Hobby      | drawing     | rock-climbing | sudoku          |
|  Job     | dressmaker  | social-worker   | coach           |
#############
```

In this solution, the hobbies and jobs are arranged according to the given clues in the puzzle."
Lv2-2x3-3	"Let's start by placing the beverages and pets in possible positions, keeping in mind the given clues.

1. The dog owner is on the right of the cola drinker.
2. The cola drinker is between the ferret owner and the tea drinker.

From clue 2, we can place the cola drinker in the middle column. This will determine the positions of the tea and ferret owner as well.

Now, let's fill in the table with possible positions:

|             |    1     |    2      |  3   |
| Beverage    |          |  Cola     |      |
| Pet         |          |  Dog       |      |

Now we need to place the tea drinker and the ferret owner based on clue 2.

Since the cola drinker is between the ferret owner and the tea drinker, this means that:

- The tea drinker will be in column 1 or 3.
- The ferret owner will be in column 1 or 3 as well.

However, we can't have both the tea drinker and the ferret owner in the same column. This leaves us with two possible configurations for columns 1 and 3:

Configuration A:
| Pet         |  Goldfish  |   Dog       |   Ferret    |
| Beverage    |      Tea     |  Cola       |     Mirinda  |

Configuration B:
| Pet         |   Ferret    |   Dog       |  Goldfish    |
| Beverage    |     Mirinda  |  Cola       |      Tea       |

Now we need to consider clue 1, which states that the dog owner is on the right of the cola drinker.

In Configuration A, the dog owner (column 3) is not directly to the right of the cola drinker (column 2). Therefore, Configuration A does not satisfy clue 1.

However, in Configuration B, the dog owner (column 3) is directly to the right of the cola drinker (column 2). This satisfies clue 1.

Therefore, the final solution table with '#############' around it is:
