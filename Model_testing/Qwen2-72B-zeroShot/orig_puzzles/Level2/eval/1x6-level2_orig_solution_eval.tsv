Lv2-1x6-4	"Let's fill in the information provided by the puzzle.

1. Goldfish -> Lizard
2. Turtle -> Far Right
3. Bird -> Goldfish -> Goat
4. Turtle -> Goat

Using this, we can create the following initial table:

```
|        |      |         |           |       |       |         |
| Pet    |  1   |   2     |    3      |  4    |  5    |   6     |

| Owner   | ???? | ???? | ???? | ???? | ???? | ???? | 
```

Now, let's fill in the known positions:

1. Goldfish -> Lizard: 2 -> 3
2. Turtle -> Far Right: 6
3. Bird -> Goldfish -> Goat: 1 -> 2 -> 4

After filling these in, we have:

```
#############
|     |  1   |   2     |    3      |  4    |  5    |   6     |
| Pet   | Bird | Goldfish | Lizard    | Goat  | ??    | Turtle |
#############
```

Now, we have two unknown owners (??). Based on the positions of known pets, we can infer that the remaining pet must be between the owner of the goat and the owner of the turtle. This means it should be in position 5.

However, we cannot determine which pet belongs to this owner without more information. Therefore, our final solution table with '#############' around it will have one unknown pet:

```
|        |      |         |           |       |       |         |
| Pet    |  1   |   2     |    3      |  4    |  5    |   6     |


| Owner   | Bird | Goldfish | Lizard    | Goat  | ??    | Turtle | 
```

This is as far as we can go with the given information."	{'pet': ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6']}	True	0	False
