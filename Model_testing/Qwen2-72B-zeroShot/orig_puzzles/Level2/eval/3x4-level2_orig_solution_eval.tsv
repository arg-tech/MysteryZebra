Lv2-3x4-5	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step:

1. Handball: Between almond-milk and fanta (##7).
2. Handball: The one drinking tea (##2). This contradicts point 1, so we know that point 1 is incorrect.

Now let's fill in what we know for sure:

|             |      1       |    2      |      3       |     4       |

| Sport        |                |           |              | Handball    |

Next, we'll use the remaining clues to fill in the rest:

3. Sudoku: Far right (##3).
4. Fanta: Left of Lemonade (##4).

Now let's place these hobbies and beverages accordingly:

|             |      1       |    2      |      3       |     4       |

| Hobby        |                |            | Sudoku        |              |
| Sport        |                |            | Handball      |              |
