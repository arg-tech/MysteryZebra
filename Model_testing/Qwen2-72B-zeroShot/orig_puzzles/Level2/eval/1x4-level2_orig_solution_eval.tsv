| Pet     | Bird   | Ferret   | Pony   | Turtle   |

Given the puzzle conditions:

1. The owner of the turtle is on the right of the owner of the bird.
2. The owner of the pony is between the owner of the ferret and the owner of the turtle.
3. The owner of the bird is on the far left.

We can construct the solution table as follows:

- Bird (Pet 1) is on the far left.
- Ferret (Pet 2) must be next to Bird, since Pony is between Ferret and Turtle.
- Thus, Pony (Pet 3) is in the middle.
- This leaves Turtle (Pet 4) to be on the right.
