Please note that there might be multiple valid solutions, as long as they satisfy all the given conditions. The solution presented above is one possible valid solution."
Lv3-2x5-5	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 1, we know that:
- Rowing is right of lemonade.

From clue 2, we know that:
- Rowing is between Fanta and Rugby.

From clue 3, we know that:
- Skateboarding is right of 7up.

From clues 4 and 5, they are just rephrasings of each other, so no new information is gained.

From clue 6, we know that:
- Water is next to lemonade (left or right).

From clue 7, this contradicts clue 6 because if the person drinking water is also the one whose sport is rowing, then water cannot be next to lemonade. Therefore, there must be an error in the puzzle, and it can't be solved with the given information.

The final solution table would look like this:

|             |    1      |       2        |    3      |   4     |      5        |
