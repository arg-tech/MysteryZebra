| Transport      | bike      | boat       | van          |

Applying the logic from the given statements, we can fill in the positions:

1. Bike driver is right of Van driver: Let's place the Bike driver at position 2 (right of 3) and the Van driver at position 3.

2. Boat driver is on far left or far right: We already placed the Bike driver at position 2, so we can put the Boat driver at position 1.

With these placements, statement 5 becomes satisfied as well.
