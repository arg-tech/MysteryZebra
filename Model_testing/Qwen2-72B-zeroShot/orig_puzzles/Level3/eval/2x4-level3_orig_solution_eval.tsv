Lv3-2x4-1	"Based on the given puzzle, we can deduce the following:

1. Crime and Thriller cannot be adjacent, which contradicts statements 1 and 2. Therefore, there must be an error in the puzzle as presented.
2. Since there's no way to resolve statements 1 and 2, we cannot definitively solve this puzzle.

However, if statement 2 were actually meant to refer to statement 3 (which is more likely a typo), then we can rearrange the genres as follows:

|                |    1      |     2      |    3     |    4      |
| Movie-Genre    | musical    | thriller    | crime     | disaster   |
| Transport      | bike       | car         | roller    | motorbike  |

But again, this solution is based on the assumption that a typo was made in statement 2."	{'movie-genre': ['musical', 'thriller', 'crime', 'disaster'], 'transport': ['bike', 'car', 'roller', 'motorbike']}	True	3	False
