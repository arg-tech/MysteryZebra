  Explanation:

1. Milk is in the first column, so the fan of dubstep (rule 11) is on its left.
2. The person watching horror movies is either to the left or right of the fan of techno (rule 2). Since the fan of rock (rule 13) is the person drinking milk, the fan of techno must be in column 2 or 4.
3. The person drinking hot chocolate is on the far left or far right (rule 3). Since the Australian is on the far left (rule 12), the person drinking hot chocolate must be in the last column.
4. The person drinking milk is on the left of the Dutch (rule 4).
5. The person eating plum is the person drinking juice (rule 5).
6. The fan of jazz is on the left or right of the Indonesian (rule 6). Since the Canadian is either to the left or right of the Australian (rule 7), the Indonesian must be in column 3.
7. The Australian is on the far left (rule 12).
8. The person watching family movies is on the left of the person eating asparagus (rule 8).
9. The person eating lime is on the right of the person watching western movies (rule 9).
10. The person watching family movies is on the left or right of the person drinking hot chocolate (rule 10).
