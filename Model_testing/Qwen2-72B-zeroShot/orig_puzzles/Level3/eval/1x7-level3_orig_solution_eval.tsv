Lv3-1x7-7	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

1. The fan of metal is on the left of the fan of funk.
   - This tells us that positions for fans of metal and funk are fixed relative to each other.

2. The fan of d&b is in the middle (position 4).
   - Now we have a fixed position for the fan of d&b.

3. The fan of classical is on the right of the fan of reggae.
   - This tells us that positions for fans of classical and reggae are fixed relative to each other, but we don't know their exact positions yet.

4. The fan of dubstep is on the right of the fan of classical.
   - Now we have a fixed relationship between the fans of dubstep and classical.

5. The fan of classical is on the left of the fan of dubstep.
   - This statement is redundant, as it's already mentioned in rule 4.

6. The fan of funk is on the left or right of the fan of d&b (position 4).
   - Now we have a fixed position for the fan of d&b and a flexible position for the fan of funk.

Using this information, let's arrange the fans in their respective positions:

|                |    1     |   2    |  3    |  4   |   5     |     6      |    7     |
