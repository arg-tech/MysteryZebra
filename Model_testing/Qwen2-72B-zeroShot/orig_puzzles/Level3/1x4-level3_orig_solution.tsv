Lv3-1x4-5	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

1. The person with basketball is on the far left or far right.
2. The person with golf is on the right of the person with surfing.
3. The person with basketball is on the right of the person with golf.

From point 3, we know that the order from left to right must be: something - golf - basketball - something

Now let's apply this knowledge to our table:

|          |       1        |    2     |  3    |     4       |
| Sport    |                |          |       |             |

We know that the order for columns 2 and 3 should be golf, basketball. Since column 1 can also be golf or basketball, we'll use the information from point 1 to decide.

From point 1, we know that basketball is on the far left or far right. If basketball were in column 4, it would violate rule 3. Therefore, basketball must be either in column 1 or column 4. Since we've already established that columns 2 and 3 should have golf and basketball respectively, we can place basketball in column 4.

With this information, let's update our table:

|          |       1        |    2     |  3    |     4       |
| Sport    |                |   golf   | bball |             |

Now, since we know that golf is to the right of surfing and basketball is to the right of golf, we can place surfing in column 1 and weightlifting in column 3.

Here's our final solution table with '#############' around it:

```
#############
|          |       1        |    2     |  3    |     4       |

| People    |   surfing     |   golf   | weightlifting| basketball |

The final solution places the sports in the correct order based on the given rules."

Since there are multiple conditions and no specific order for the genres, it's not possible to uniquely determine a single solution table. The puzzle leaves room for several valid arrangements.

Therefore, we cannot surround a final solution table with '#############' as there isn't a unique solution."
Lv3-1x4-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

1. From clue #2, the epic movie watcher is on the far left or far right.
2. From clue #3, the adventure movie watcher is to the left of the fantasy movie watcher.
3. From clue #4, the fantasy movie watcher is on the far right.

Now let's fill in the table:

```

```

- A: Adventure
- E: Epic (far left)
- D: Disaster
- F: Fantasy (far right)
- C: ?
- B: ?
- G: ?

The remaining positions are:

- 2: Between epic and disaster, we can place an unknown genre.
- 3: Left of fantasy and right of adventure, another unknown genre can be placed here.

So the final solution table is:

```
