Lv3-2x2-3	"Based on the given puzzle:
#############
|                |   1     |    2      |
| Movie-Genre    | sports   | western    |
| Nationality    | french   | nigerian   |
#############
We can place the nationalities and movie genres accordingly:

1. French is on the left of the person watching western movies.
2. The statement ""the french is on the left or right"" doesn't provide new information since it's already given in point 1.

So, the final solution table would be:

|                |   1     |    2      |
| Movie-Genre    | sports   | western    |
| Nationality    | french   | nigerian   |

Lv3-2x2-4	"Based on the given puzzle:
#############
|             |   1     |    2     |
| Beverage    | Fanta#### | Sprite####|
| Food        | Tomato#### | Apricot####|
#############
Here's a description of how I arrived at this solution:

1. Since there are only two beverage options, we know that one person drinks Fanta and the other drinks Sprite.
2. Similarly, there are two food options. One person eats Tomato, and the other eats Apricot.
3. From clue 1, the person eating Apricot is on the right of the person drinking Sprite. Therefore, Sprite must be in position 1, and Apricot must be in position 2.
4. Since we have placed Fanta and Sprite based on clue 1, we can now place Tomato and Apricot accordingly. This leaves us with the final solution table surrounded by '#############' as requested."
