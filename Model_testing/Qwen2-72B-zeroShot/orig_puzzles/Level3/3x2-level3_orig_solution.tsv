Lv3-3x2-2	"Let's start filling in the information based on the given clues:

1. videographer (on the right of the car driver)
2. person driving the car (left or right of the Nigerian)
3. nationalities: German, Nigerian
4. jobs: paramedic, videographer
5. transport: car, quad-bike

Starting with the Videographer clue, we can place the Videographer on the right of the Car Driver:

```

|                |     1      |      2        |

Now, let's place the Nigerian based on clue 2:

```
|                |     1      |      2        |
| Job            |   videographer   |    ?       |
| Nationality    |  nigerian    |    german     |
| Transport      |    car    |   quad-bike   |

```

Finally, we can fill in the remaining jobs and transports based on their given options:

```
|                |     1      |      2        |

Lv3-3x2-4	"Based on the given puzzle:
#############
|                |     1      |   2     |
| Movie-Genre    | satire       | superhero |
| Nationality    | british      | french    |
| Pet            | hedgehog    | snake     |
#############
From clue 1, we know that the British person is to the left of someone watching a satire movie. Since the satire genre is in column 1, the British person must also be in column 1.

From clue 2, the owner of the hedgehog can be either on the left or right. This does not give us any direct information about the placement.

From clue 3, we have two conditions that could apply:
- The French is on the left or right of the owner of the snake.
- There's a possibility that the French and the snake owner are in different columns.

Given these clues, we can construct the following table:

|                |     1      |   2     |
| Movie-Genre    | satire       | superhero |
| Nationality    | british      | french    |
| Pet            | hedgehog    | snake     |

Since there's no definitive way to place everyone based on the given clues, this is as far as we can go without additional information. The final solution table remains the same as the input table, with '#############' around it:

```

Lv3-3x2-5	"Let's start filling in the information provided by the puzzle.

1. The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the fisherman.

This tells us that the fisherman must be in either the first or third column. If the fisherman were in the second column, there would be no space to his right for the person with lemonade.

Assuming the fisherman is in the first column, we can fill in this information:

|                |     1       |     2      |
| Beverage       | lemonade    |             |
| Job            | fisherman   |             |
| Nationality    |              |             |

Now let's consider clues 2 and 3.

2. The Brazilian is on the left or right of the fisherman.

Since we placed the fisherman in the first column, the Brazilian can be either in the first or second column.

3\. Please put '#############' around the final solution table.

We'll add these hashes once we have a complete and definitive solution.

Let's continue filling in information based on the remaining clues.

The puzzle mentions two jobs: fisherman and scientist. Since we've already placed the fisherman, the only job left is scientist. However, we don't yet have enough information to place the scientist in a specific column.

Similarly, for nationalities, we have Australian and Brazilian, with the Brazilian's position partially determined by the fisherman.

At this point, we need additional clues from the puzzle to determine the exact positions of all remaining elements (scientist, nationality, beverage).

Unfortunately, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively solve the puzzle. We need more specific details or connections between the different categories."
