Lv3-1x2-1	"Based on the given logic puzzle, we can deduce the following:

1. Soy-milk drinker is either in position 1 or position 2.
2. Fanta drinker is to the right of the soy-milk drinker.
3. There are only two different favorite beverages: fanta and soy-milk.

Given these rules, let's fill in the table accordingly:

|             |    1      |   2    |
| Beverage    | Soy-Milk  | Fanta   |

Now, let's add '#############' around the final solution table:

```
#############
|             |    1      |   2    |
| Beverage    | Soy-Milk  | Fanta   |
|             |            |         |

Lv3-1x2-2	"Based on the given logic puzzle:

1. The architect is either on the left or right of the electrician.
2. The electrician is on the right of the architect.

From these conditions, we can deduce that the only possible arrangement is for the electrician to be in Job 2 and the architect to be in Job 1.

Here's the final solution table surrounded by '#############':

```
|        |     1      |      2       |
| Job    |            |              |
|        |     arch   |      elec    |

|         | #             | #             |
|         | ############# | ############# |
```

The final solution table shows the electrician in Job 2 and the architect in Job 1, satisfying both conditions of the puzzle."
Lv3-1x2-3	"Based on the puzzle, we can fill in the table as follows:

|          |      1       |    2     |
| Hobby    |    Camping   | Woodworking |

Since there's no specific arrangement for people, and the puzzle only cares about their hobbies and relative positions, this solution satisfies both rules.

The final solution table with '#############' around it is as follows:

```
#############
|          |      1       |    2     |
| Hobby    |    Camping   | Woodworking |
#############

Lv3-1x2-4	"Based on the given puzzle:

|                |  1    |   2    |
| Music-Genre    |       |        |

The final solution table, surrounded by '#############', is:

```
#############
|                |  1    |   2    |
| Music-Genre    | house  | soul   |
#############
```

According to the puzzle rules:

1. The fan of soul is on the left of the fan of house.
2. The fan of house is on the left or right of the fan of soul.

These rules are fulfilled in the final solution table."
Lv3-1x2-5	"Based on the given puzzle:

```
|        |    1     |     2      |
| Job    |          |            |

The final solution table with '#############' is:

```
#############
|        |    1     |     2      |
| Job    | manager   | scientist   |
#############
```

According to the puzzle:
1. The manager is on the far left, so we place 'manager' in the first column.
2. The scientist is on the left or right of the manager. Since the manager is in the first column, the scientist must be in either the first or second column.

Therefore, we place 'scientist' in the second column and surround the final solution table with '#############'."
Lv3-1x2-6	"Based on the given puzzle, we can deduce that there are two people with different hobbies: camping and card-games.

From clues 1 and 2, it's clear that the person with the camping hobby is to the left of the person with the card-game hobby.

Therefore, the final solution table is:
#############
|          |     1       |    2     |
| Hobby    |  camping      | card-games|
#############
The two hobbies are separated by '#############' as requested."
Lv3-1x2-7	"Let's denote the people as P1 (bus driver) and P2 (bike driver). According to the puzzle:

1. P1 is on the right of P2.
2. P1 is on the left or right of P2 (this is already implied by rule 1).

Now let's fill in the table:

|              |  1    |  2   |
| Transport    | bus    | bike  |
| Position      | Right  | Left  |

Surrounding the final solution table with '#############':

Lv3-1x2-8	"Based on the given puzzle:

1. The freelancer is either on the left or right of the coach, but we know from statement 2 that they are on the right.
  
2. The freelancer is on the right of the coach.

Therefore, the final solution table looks like this:
#############
|        |   1    |     2       |
| Job     |   coach | freelancer   |
#############

Please note that there's an inconsistency in the puzzle statement. Statement 3 is a repetition of statement 1, but it's also contradictory to statement 2. Therefore, I've ignored statement 3 since it doesn't provide any new information or constraints."
Lv3-1x2-9	"Based on the given puzzle, we can fill in the table as follows:

|        |       1        |     2      |
| Job    |    Bartender   | Social-Worker|

Since the social-worker is on the left of the bartender (option 2), the final solution table is:
#############

Lv3-1x2-10	"Based on the given puzzle:

1. The person drinking sprite is either to the left or right of the person drinking cola.
2. The person drinking cola is on the left of the person drinking sprite.

These two conditions are contradictory. Condition 1 suggests that the sprite drinker can be either to the left or right of the cola drinker, while condition 2 specifically states that the cola drinker is to the left of the sprite drinker.

As a result, it's not possible to construct a table satisfying both conditions simultaneously."
