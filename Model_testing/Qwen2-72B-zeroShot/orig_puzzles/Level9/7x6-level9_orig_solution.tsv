Lv9-7x6-2	"Based on the given puzzle, we can deduce the following:

1. The Japanese (日本人) is the person eating mango and also owns the lizard.
2. The nurse (看護士) is not to the right of the owner of the rabbit, who is also the person who's hobby is photography. This means that the nurse is either on the left or in the same position as the photographer/rabbit owner.

Given this information, we can create a tentative solution table:
