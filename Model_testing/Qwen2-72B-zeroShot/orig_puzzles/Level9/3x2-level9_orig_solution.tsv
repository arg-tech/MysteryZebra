Lv9-3x2-2	"Based on the given puzzle, we can fill in the table as follows:

|                |       1        |    2     |

| Pet            | dog              | hamster         |

Since rule 3 states that the person watching martial-arts movies is on the far left, we can swap positions 1 and 2 for the ""Movie-Genre"" row:

|                |       1        |    2     |
| Beverage       |    tea          | hot- chocolate|

| Pet            | dog              | hamster         |

Lv9-3x2-4	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

1. Parity positions: There are two people with the same parity (either both even or both odd) in positions related to cola and romance movies.
2. Frog owner to the right of milk drinker: The person who owns a frog is positioned to the right of the person who drinks milk.

First, let's arrange the beverages based on the clue about the frog owner:

|                |      1        |    2     |
| Beverage       | **milk**     |          | 
| Movie-Genre    |               |          |
| Pet            |               |          |

Now, we know that the person drinking milk is in position 1. According to clue 2, the frog owner is to the right of this person. Therefore, the frog owner must be in position 2.

|                |      1        |    2     |
| Beverage       | **milk**     |          | 
| Movie-Genre    |               |          |
| Pet            |               | **frog** |

Since there are only two beverages (cola and milk), the person drinking cola must be in position 2.

|                |      1        |    2     |
| Beverage       | **milk**     | **cola**| 
| Movie-Genre    |               |          |
| Pet            |               | **frog** |

Now let's deal with movie genres. We have two movie genres (martial-arts and romance). Since the person watching romance movies has the same parity position as the person drinking cola, they must both be in position 2.

|                |      1        |    2     |
| Beverage       | **milk**     | **cola**| 
| Movie-Genre    |               | **romance**|
| Pet            |               | **frog** |

This leaves martial-arts for position 1.

|                |      1        |    2     |
| Beverage       | **milk**     | **cola**| 
| Movie-Genre    | **martial-arts**| **romance**|
| Pet            |               | **frog** |

We haven't assigned pets yet. Since the frog owner is in position 2, the turtle must be in position 1.

|                |      1        |    2     |
| Beverage       | **milk**     | **cola**| 
| Movie-Genre    | **martial-arts**| **romance**|
| Pet            | **turtle**   | **frog** |

Finally, let's put the '#############' around the final solution table.

Lv9-3x2-5	"Let's start by filling in the known information:

1. Writing and Ice-Hockey:
   Since they have different parity positions, we can place them diagonally from each other.

2. Mystery Movies and Ice-Hockey:
   The person watching mystery movies is on the right of the person who plays ice-hockey.

Now let's fill in the table step by step:

1. Place Writing and Ice-Hockey:

```
|                |     1       |    2     |
| Hobby          |      ?       | writing   |

| Sport          |      ?       | ice-hockey|
```

2. Since the person watching mystery movies is on the right of the ice-hockey player, we can place Mystery to the right:

```
|                |     1       |    2     |
| Hobby          |      ?       | writing   |
| Movie-Genre    |             | mystery    |
| Sport          |      ?       | ice-hockey|

| Hobby          | card-games  | writing   |
| Movie-Genre    |             | mystery    |
| Sport          |      ?       | ice-hockey|
```

4. Lastly, we need to fill in Cycling as the other sport:

```
|                |     1       |    2     |
| Hobby          | card-games  | writing   |

| Nationality    | turkish     | french    |
| Sport          | badminton   | skiing    |

Explanation:
1. Since the person eating raspberry and the person who's sport is badminton have the same parity positions, we can place them in either position 1 or 2. In this case, I've placed raspberry in position 1 and badminton in position 1 as well.
2. According to clue number 2, the turkish nationality is on the right of the person eating raspberry. Since we've placed raspberry in position 1, the turkish nationality will be in position 2.
