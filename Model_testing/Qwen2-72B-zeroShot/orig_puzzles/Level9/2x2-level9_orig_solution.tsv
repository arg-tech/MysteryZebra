Lv9-2x2-1	"Based on the given information, we can deduce the following:

1. Rowing is in an odd position, which means it must be either Sport 1 or 3.
2. Raspberry and rowing have the same parity positions, which means if rowing is in an odd position (Sport 1 or 3), raspberry must also be in an odd position for Food (Food 1 or 3).

Now, let's fill out the table:

|          |     1      |    2     |
| Food     | Grapes      | Raspberry |
| Sport    | Parkour     | Rowing    |

Since we don't have enough information to determine which is Food 1 and which is Food 3 (or the same for Sport), we will leave it as is.

Final solution table:

|          |     1      |    2     |
| Food     | Grapes      | Raspberry |
| Sport    | Parkour     | Rowing    |

Lv9-2x2-2	"Based on the given information, we can deduce the following:

1. There are two people (positions) for each beverage and food.
2. Parity positions refer to whether the position is odd or even.
3. From clue #1, since asparagus is a vegetable and typically eaten by adults, it's more likely that asparagus will be in an odd position. Therefore, the person drinking 7up (who also has the same parity position as the one eating asparagus) is more likely to be in an odd position.
4. From clue #2, we know that the person drinking 7up is somewhere to the right of the person drinking milk.

Given this information, here's a possible solution:

|             |     1      |     2      |
| Beverage    |    Milk     |   7Up       |

Lv9-2x2-5	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

From statement 1:
- The person drinking sprite and the gardener have different parity positions (either odd or even).

From statement 2:
- The person drinking sprite is to the left of the gardener.

Let's denote the people with their favorite beverages and hobbies:

1. Iced-tea Gardening
2. Sprite Woodworking

Now, let's position them based on statement 2:

|      |       |        |
|-------|-------|--------|
|   1   |   2   |        |

Since sprite is to the left of gardening, this arrangement satisfies statement 2.

However, we also need to consider statement 1. Since gardening has an even parity position (it's in the middle), the person drinking sprite must be on an odd parity position, which means they should be in position 1 or 3.

In our current arrangement, sprite is in position 2, which doesn't satisfy statement 1. Therefore, we need to swap positions 1 and 2:

|      |       |        |
|-------|-------|--------|
|   2   |   1   |        |

Now, the person drinking sprite (position 1) has an odd parity position, while the gardener (position 2) has an even parity position. This arrangement satisfies both statement 1 and statement 2.

Finally, let's put '#############' around the solution table:

|#############|
|      |       |        |
|-------|-------|--------|
|   2   |   1   |        |

Solution:
- Person 1 drinks sprite and enjoys woodworking.
- Person 2 drinks iced-tea and loves gardening."

Since there are no specific positions given for parity, we can't determine exact positions based on the information provided. Therefore, no '#############' is needed around the solution table."
Lv9-2x2-7	"Based on the given puzzle:

1. The fisherman and the owner of the rat have different parity positions.
2. The owner of the snake is in an odd position.

Let's fill out the table accordingly:

|        |     1      |   2    |
| Job    | Fisherman   | Nurse   |
| Pet    | Snake         | Rat     |

Since we know that the fisherman and the rat owner have different parity positions, but we already placed the snake in an odd position, this means that the fisherman must be in an even position. Therefore:

|        |     1      |   2    |
| Job    | Nurse       | Fisherman|
| Pet    | Snake         | Rat     |

Lv9-2x2-10	"Based on the given information, we can deduce the following:

1. The Indonesian is either in position 1 or position 2.
2. Parity positions refer to odd or even positions. Since there are only two positions, one will be an odd number (1) and the other will be an even number (2).
3. From clue 2, we know that the carrot eater is to the right of the apricot eater.

Now let's fill in the table:

|                |     1       |    2     |
| Food           |     -       |   carrot  |
| Nationality    |  indonesian |   british |

From clue 1, we know that the Indonesian and the apricot eater have the same parity position. Since the carrot eater is to the right of the apricot eater, it means that the apricot eater cannot be in position 2 (even). Therefore, the Indonesian must also be in an odd position, which leaves position 1.

So the final solution table with '#############' around it:
