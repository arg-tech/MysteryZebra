| Pet            | guinea-pig | hamster  | ferret        | rat       |

Explanation:
1. Rat's owner is not to the right of Ferret's owner, which means they must be next to each other.
2. Rat's owner is on the right of the Brazilian, so we place the Brazilian in cell 1.
3. Chinese is on the left or right of the German. This can be satisfied by placing them in cells 2 and 3 respectively.
4-5. The Mexican is somewhere to the right of the guinea-pig's owner (cell 1) but not to the left of the rat's owner, which means the Mexican must go in cell 4.

Now all conditions are met, and we have the final solution table surrounded by '#############' as requested:
