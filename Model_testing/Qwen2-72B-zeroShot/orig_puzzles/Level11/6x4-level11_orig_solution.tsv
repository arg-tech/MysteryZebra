| Transport        | bus         | roller         | subway        | train        |

Now let's use the given information to fill in the positions.

1. and 9: The person watching martial-arts movies is eating pear, or the owner of the snake drinks mirinda.
2. and 20: The person drinking milk has the same parity position as the colombian, who may be drinking milk or watching mystery movies.
3. and 13: The person drinking mirinda is either eating pear or watching time-travel movies, but not both.
4. and 19: The colombian may be drinking milk or watching mystery movies, but not both.

Now let's position the people based on their parity (even/odd) positions:

1. Even: Owner of the snake, Person drinking milk
2. Odd: Person driving roller, Person eating mango

The nationality and movie genre parity information is not enough to definitively place them in even or odd positions.

At this point, we have the beverages, foods, pets, and modes of transport placed based on their given relationships. However, we cannot fully determine the even/odd positions for nationalities and movie genres without more specific information.
