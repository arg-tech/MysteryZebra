Lv11-3x4-1	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

From clues 1, 4, and 12:
- The Brazilian is in an even position.
- The person drinking juice and the person watching western movies have different parity positions.
- The person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking juice.

We can deduce that the Brazilian must be either 2 or 4. If the Brazilian were at position 2, then the person drinking almond-milk would be at position 1, which contradicts clue 12. Therefore, the Brazilian must be at position 4.

Using this information and other clues, we can fill in the table:

|                |    1     |      2        |    3      |    4      |

| Nationality    | ???       |         ???        | ???        | brazilian |

Since the puzzle didn't provide enough information to fill in all the blanks, we can only provide partial solutions. The final solution table would look like this:

|                |    1     |      2        |    3      |    4      |
