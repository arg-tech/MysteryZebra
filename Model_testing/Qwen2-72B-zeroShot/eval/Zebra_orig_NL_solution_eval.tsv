Zebra_orig_NL_1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we'll use the given clues and fill in the table step by step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **The English is the person who likes red.**
   - Place ""English"" under Nationality in column 3 (since red must be in a middle position to satisfy other constraints).
   - Place ""Red"" under Color in column 3.

2. **The Spanish is the owner of the dog.**
   - Place ""Spanish"" and ""Dog"" in one of the columns, but we need more information to determine which one.

3. **The person drinking coffee is the person who likes green.**
   - Place ""Coffee"" under Beverage and ""Green"" under Color in the same column. We'll place this in column 2 (as it needs to be to the left of red).

4. **The Ukrainian is the person drinking tea.**
   - Place ""Ukrainian"" under Nationality and ""Tea"" under Beverage in one of the columns, but we need more information to determine which one.

5. **The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.**
   - Since ""Green"" is in column 2, ""Ivory"" must be in column 1.
   - Place ""Ivory"" under Color in column 1.

6. **The Old-Gold smoker is the owner of the snails.**
   - We already know that ""Old-Gold"" is in column 3.
   - Place ""Snails"" under Pet in column 3.

7. **The Kools smoker is the person who likes yellow.**
   - Place ""Kools"" and ""Yellow"" in the same column. Since ""Ivory"" is in column 1, ""Yellow"" must be in column 4.
   - Place ""Kools"" under Cigar and ""Yellow"" under Color in column 4.

8. **The person drinking milk is in the middle.**
   - Place ""Milk"" under Beverage in column 3.

9. **The Norwegian is on the far left.**
   - Place ""Norwegian"" under Nationality in column 1.
   - Since the Ukrainian drinks tea and is not in column 1, place ""Ukrainian"" and ""Tea"" in column 2.

10. **The Chesterfields smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox.**
    - We already know that ""Chesterfield"" is in column 2.
    - The fox must be in either column 1 or column 3 (since it's adjacent to column 2).
    - Place ""Fox"" under Pet in column 1.

11. **The Kools smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse.**
    - Since ""Kools"" is in column 4, the horse must be in either column 3 or column 5.
    - Place ""Horse"" under Pet in column 5 (since column 3 already has a pet).

12. **The Lucky-Strike smoker is the person drinking orange juice.**
    - Place ""Lucky-Strike"" and ""Orange Juice"" in the same column. Since ""Milk"" is in column 3, place ""Lucky-Strike"" and ""Orange Juice"" in column 5.

13. **The Japanese is the Parliaments smoker.**
    - Place ""Japanese"" under Nationality and ""Parliaments"" under Cigar in column 5.

14. **The Norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue.**
    - Since the Norwegian is in column 1, the person who likes blue must be in column 2.
    - Place ""Blue"" under Color in column 2.

Zebra_orig_NL_2	"Let's solve this puzzle step by step using the given clues.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 9:** The Norwegian is on the far left.
   - House 1: Norwegian

2. **Clue 8:** The person drinking milk is in the middle.
   - House 3: Milk

3. **Clue 14:** The Norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue.
   - Since the Norwegian is on the far left, the person who likes blue must be in house 2.

4. **Clue 5:** The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.
   - This means that if someone likes ivory, they cannot be in house 5 (since there's no one to their right). They can only be in houses 1, 2, or 3. Since house 1 is Norwegian and house 3 has milk, the person who likes ivory must be in house 2.
   - Therefore, the person who likes green must be in house 3 (but we already know that house 3 has milk), so they must be in house 4.

5. **Clue 3:** The person drinking coffee is the person who likes green.
   - House 4: Coffee, Green

6. **Clue 12:** The lucky-strike-smoker is the person drinking orange-juice.
   - Since house 3 has milk and house 4 has coffee, the person who drinks orange juice must be in either house 2 or house 5.

7. **Clue 10:** The Chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox.
   - We know that Chesterfield is smoked by someone (from the given table), and it can only be in houses 2, 3, or 4. Since house 4 has coffee and green, and house 3 has milk, the Chesterfields-smoker must be in house 2.

8. **Clue 1:** The English is the person who likes red.
   - Red cannot be in house 1 (Norwegian), house 2 (Chesterfield-smoker), or house 4 (Green). Therefore, the English must be in house 3 with red and milk.

9. **Clue 7:** The Kools-smoker is the person who likes yellow.
   - Since the Norwegian is in house 1, and we already have Chesterfields in house 2 and green in house 4, the Kools-smoker must be in house 5.

10. **Clue 13:** The Japanese is the Parliaments-smoker.
    - From the given table, Parliament is smoked by someone in house 5. Therefore, the Japanese is in house 5 with yellow and kools.

11. **Clue 4:** The Ukrainian is the person drinking tea.
    - Since we have milk in house 3, coffee in house 4, and orange juice in either house 2 or 5 (but not 5 because it's Japanese), the Ukrainian must be in house 2 with tea.

12. **Clue 11:** The Kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse.
    - Since the Kools-smoker is in house 5, the owner of the horse must be in house 4.

13. **Clue 6:** The Old-gold-smoker is the owner of the snails.
    - From the given table, Old-gold is smoked by someone in house 3. Therefore, the person who likes red and milk (English) also has snails.

14. **Clue 2:** The Spanish is the owner of the dog.
    - Since we have already placed all other nationalities, the Spanish must be in house 5 with yellow, kools, and the horse.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

   - House 1: Nationality = Norwegian

2. **Milk in the middle (Clue 8):**
   - House 3: Beverage = Milk

3. **English likes red (Clue 1):**
   - Since the Norwegian is on the far left, the English cannot be there.
   - The only house that can fit this clue without conflict is House 2 or 3.
   - However, since the person in House 3 drinks milk, the English must be in House 2.
   - House 2: Nationality = English, Color = Red

4. **Green to the right of ivory (Clue 5):**
   - The only possible houses for green are House 3 or 4.
   - Since the person in House 3 drinks milk, they cannot like green.
   - Therefore, House 4 must be green, and House 3 must be ivory.
   - House 3: Color = Ivory
   - House 4: Color = Green

5. **Green likes coffee (Clue 3):**
   - House 4: Beverage = Coffee

6. **Yellow liked by Kools smoker (Clue 7):**
   - The only house left for yellow is House 1.
   - House 1: Color = Yellow, Cigar = Kools

7. **Ukrainian drinks tea (Clue 4):**
   - Since the Norwegian is in House 1 and the English are in House 2, the Ukrainian must be in House 3.
   - House 3: Nationality = Ukrainian, Beverage = Tea

8. **Old-Gold smoker owns snails (Clue 6):**
   - The only house left for Old-Gold is House 4.
   - House 4: Cigar = Old-Gold, Pet = Snails

9. **Lucky-Strike smoker drinks orange juice (Clue 12):**
   - The only house left for Lucky-Strike is House 5.
   - House 5: Cigar = Lucky-Strike, Beverage = Orange Juice

    - The only house left for Spanish is House 5.
    - House 5: Pet = Dog

13. **Chesterfields smoker on the left or right of fox owner (Clue 10):**
    - Chesterfields are in House 2, so the fox must be in House 1 or 3.
    - Since House 3 is occupied by Ukrainian and no other pet fits there, the fox must be in House 1.
    - House 1: Pet = Fox

14. **Kools smoker to the left or right of horse owner (Clue 11):**
    - Kools are in House 1, so the horse must be in House 2 or 3.
