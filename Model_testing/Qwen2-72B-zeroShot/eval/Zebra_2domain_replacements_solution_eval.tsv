### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Column 1 (London):**
   - Person traveling to London is on the far left (Clue 9).
   - The person traveling to London is to the left or right of the person who likes blue (Clue 14). This means the person who likes blue must be in column 2.

2. **Column 3 (Social-Worker):**
   - The social-worker is in the middle (Clue 8).

3. **Column 5 (Colone and Parliaments):**
   - The person traveling to Colone is the parliaments-smoker (Clue 13). This means column 5 must be Colone and Parliament.

4. **Column 2 (Ivory and Blue):**
   - The person who likes blue must be in column 2 (from Clue 14).
   - The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory (Clue 5). This means column 2 must be Ivory, and column 3 must be Green.

5. **Column 1 (Red):**
   - The person traveling to Berlin is the person who likes red (Clue 1). Since column 1 is London, this means column 1 cannot be Berlin, so column 1 must be Red.

6. **Column 4 (Yellow and Kools):**
   - The kools-smoker is the person who likes yellow (Clue 7). This means column 4 must be Yellow and Kools.
   - The kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse (Clue 11). Since column 4 is Kools, the horse must be in column 3 or 5.

7. **Column 5 (Fox):**
   - The chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox (Clue 10). Since column 5 is Chesterfields, the fox must be in column 4 or 2.

8. **Column 3 (Green and Architect):**
   - The architect is the person who likes green (Clue 3). This means column 3 must be Green and Architect.
   - The social-worker is already in column 3, so this confirms that column 3 is Social-Worker and Architect.

9. **Column 1 (London and Blue):**
   - The person traveling to London is to the left or right of the person who likes blue (Clue 14). Since column 1 is London, the person who likes blue must be in column 2.

10. **Column 2 (Nizza and Dog):**
    - The person traveling to Nizza is the owner of the dog (Clue 2). This means column 2 must be Nizza and Dog.
    - Since column 2 is Ivory, this confirms that column 2 is Ivory and Blue.

11. **Column 3 (Green and Horse):**
    - The kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse (Clue 11). Since column 4 is Kools, the horse must be in column 3.
    - The social-worker is already in column 3, so this confirms that column 3 is Social-Worker, Architect, Green, and Horse.

12. **Column 5 (Colone, Parliaments, and Zebra):**
    - The person traveling to Colone is the parliaments-smoker (Clue 13). This means column 5 must be Colone and Parliament.
    - Since the zebra is not yet placed and there are no other clues for it, it must be in column 5.

13. **Column 4 (Marseilles, Dancer, Chesterfields, and Fox):**
    - The person traveling to Marseilles is the dancer (Clue 4). This means column 4 must be Marseilles and Dancer.
    - Since column 4 is Kools, the fox must be in column 4.

14. **Column 2 (Nizza, Dog, Lucky-Strike, and Project-Manager):**
    - The lucky-strike-smoker is the project-manager (Clue 12). This means column 2 must be Lucky-Strike and Project-Manager.
    - Since column 2 is Nizza and Dog, this confirms that column 2 is Nizza, Dog, Lucky-Strike, and Project-Manager.

Zebra_domain_replacements_1	"To solve this puzzle, we need to systematically place each attribute (food, color, sport, cigar, and pet) in the correct position based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 10: The person eating pomegranate is on the far left.**
   - Place ""pomegranate"" in column 1 under ""Food"".

2. **Clue 8: The person who's sport is surfing is in the middle.**
   - Place ""surfing"" in column 3 under ""Sport"".

3. **Clue 5: The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.**
   - This means that if someone likes ivory, they must be in a column to the left of the person who likes green.

4. **Clue 3: The person who's sport is skiing is the person who likes green.**
   - Place ""skiing"" and ""green"" together. Since ""green"" must be to the right of ""ivory"", we can place ""green"" in column 2 or 3, but since ""surfing"" is already in column 3, ""green"" must be in column 2.
   - Therefore, ""skiing"" goes in column 2 under ""Sport"".

5. **Clue 14: The person eating pomegranate is to the left or right of the person who likes blue.**
   - Since ""pomegranate"" is in column 1, ""blue"" must be in column 2 or 3. But since ""green"" is already in column 2, ""blue"" must be in column 3.

6. **Clue 4: The person eating potato is the person who's sport is cycling.**
   - Place ""potato"" and ""cycling"" together. Since ""surfing"" is in column 3, ""cycling"" must be in another column. Let's try column 4 for now.

7. **Clue 1: The person eating strawberry is the person who likes red.**
   - Place ""strawberry"" and ""red"" together. They can't be in columns 2 or 3 (already occupied by ""green"" and ""blue""). Let's try column 5 for now.

8. **Clue 7: The kools-smoker is the person who likes yellow.**
   - Place ""kools"" and ""yellow"" together. They can't be in columns 2, 3, or 5 (already occupied by ""green"", ""blue"", and ""red""). Let's try column 4 for now.

9. **Clue 11: The kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse.**
   - Since ""kools"" is in column 4, the horse must be in column 3 or 5. But since ""blue"" is already in column 3, the horse must be in column 5.

10. **Clue 2: The person eating lime is the owner of the dog.**
    - Place ""lime"" and ""dog"" together. They can't be in columns 2, 3, or 4 (already occupied by ""green"", ""blue"", and ""kools""). Let's try column 5 for now.

11. **Clue 6: The old-gold-smoker is the owner of the snails.**
    - Place ""olg-gold"" and ""snails"" together. They can't be in columns 2, 3, or 4 (already occupied by ""green"", ""blue"", and ""kools""). Let's try column 1 for now.

12. **Clue 9: The chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox.**
    - Since ""chesterfield"" is in column 2, the fox must be in column 1 or 3. But since ""pomegranate"" and ""old-gold"" are already in column 1, the fox must be in column 3.

13. **Clue 12: The lucky-strike-smoker is the person who's sport is handball.**
    - Place ""lucky-strike"" and ""handball"" together. They can't be in columns 2, 3, or 4 (already occupied by ""green"", ""blue"", and ""kools""). Let's try column 5 for now.

14. **Clue 13: The person eating peach is the parliaments-smoker.**
    - Place ""peach"" and ""parliament"" together. They can't be in columns 2, 3, or 4 (already occupied by ""green"", ""blue"", and ""kools""). Let's try column 5 for now.

Now, let's fill in the remaining attributes:

- Column 1: ""pomegranate"", ""old-gold"", ""snails""
- Column 2: ""strawberry"", ""red"", ""skiing"", ""green""
- Column 3: ""potato"", ""cycling"", ""blue"", ""fox""
- Column 4: ""lime"", ""dog"", ""yellow"", ""kools""
- Column 5: ""peach"", ""parliament"", ""handball""

Finally, let's place the remaining sports and pets:

- Column 1: ""golf"" (since all other sports are taken)
- Column 2: ""surfing"" (already placed)
- Column 3: ""cycling"" (already placed)
- Column 4: ""handball"" (already placed)
- Column 5: ""skiing"" (already placed)

Zebra_domain_replacements_2	"To solve this puzzle, we need to systematically place each item (food, color, hobby, cigar, pet) in the correct column based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Clue 8**: The person who's hobby is photography is in the middle.
   - Place ""photography"" in column 3.

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.
   - This means the person who likes green must be in columns 2, 3, or 4, and the person who likes ivory must be in columns 1, 2, or 3.

3. **Clue 9**: The person eating tomato is on the far left.
   - Place ""tomato"" in column 1.

4. **Clue 14**: The person eating tomato is to the left or right of the person who likes blue.
   - This means the person who likes blue must be in columns 2 or 3 (since column 1 already has ""tomato"").

5. **Clue 3**: The person who's hobby is collecting is the person who likes green.
   - Since ""photography"" is in column 3, ""collecting"" cannot be in column 3. Therefore, ""green"" must be in column 2 or 4. Given clue 5, if ""green"" is in column 2, then ""ivory"" must be in column 1, which conflicts with ""tomato"" in column 1. Thus, ""green"" must be in column 4.
   - Place ""collecting"" in column 4.

6. **Clue 5**: The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.
   - Since ""green"" is in column 4, ""ivory"" must be in column 3.
   - Place ""ivory"" in column 3.

7. **Clue 14**: The person eating tomato is to the left or right of the person who likes blue.
   - Since ""tomato"" is in column 1 and ""green"" is in column 4, ""blue"" must be in column 2.
   - Place ""blue"" in column 2.

8. **Clue 7**: The kools-smoker is the person who likes yellow.
   - Since ""yellow"" cannot be in columns 1, 3, or 4 (already occupied by tomato, ivory, and green), it must be in column 5.
   - Place ""kools"" in column 5.

9. **Clue 6**: The old-gold-smoker is the owner of the snails.
   - Since ""olg-gold"" is in column 3, place ""snails"" in column 3.

10. **Clue 4**: The person eating banana is the person who's hobby is board-games.
    - Place ""banana"" and ""board-games"" in column 5 (since ""photography"" is in column 3).

11. **Clue 2**: The person eating potato is the owner of the dog.
    - Since ""potato"" cannot be in columns 1, 3, or 5 (already occupied by tomato, snails, and banana), it must be in column 2.
    - Place ""dog"" in column 2.

12. **Clue 1**: The person eating cranberry is the person who likes red.
    - Since ""red"" cannot be in columns 3, 4, or 5 (already occupied by ivory, green, and yellow), it must be in column 1.
    - Place ""cranberry"" in column 1.

13. **Clue 12**: The lucky-strike-smoker is the person who's hobby is skydiving.
    - Since ""skydiving"" cannot be in columns 3, 4, or 5 (already occupied by photography, collecting, and board-games), it must be in column 2.
    - Place ""lucky-strike"" in column 2.

14. **Clue 10**: The chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox.
    - Since ""chesterfield"" is in column 2, the fox must be in column 1 or 3 (since column 5 already has snails).
    - Place ""fox"" in column 1.

15. **Clue 11**: The kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse.
    - Since ""kools"" is in column 5, the horse must be in column 4 (since column 3 already has snails).
    - Place ""horse"" in column 4.

16. **Clue 13**: The person eating carrot is the parliaments-smoker.
    - Since ""parliament"" is in column 5, place ""carrot"" in column 5.
