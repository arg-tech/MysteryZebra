#### 1. Place known information:
- **Parkour** in column 1 (Clue 9).
- **Milk** in column 3 (Clue 8).

#### 2. Use Clue 4 and Clue 5 to place Green and White:
- Since the person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white, and the only possible positions are columns 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, we can place Green in column 2 and White in column 3 (since Milk is already in column 3, it must be in column 4).

#### 3. Use Clue 5 to place Coffee:
- The person who likes green drinks coffee, so Coffee is in column 2.

#### 4. Use Clue 1 to place Red and Tennis:
- The person who plays tennis likes red, and since Green is in column 2, Red must be in column 1 (the only other available position on the left of White).

#### 5. Use Clue 9 to confirm Parkour and Red:
- Since Parkour is in column 1 and the person who plays parkour likes red, we place Red in column 1.

#### 6. Use Clue 14 to place Blue:
- The person who plays parkour (column 1) is on the left or right of the person who likes blue, so Blue must be in column 2.

- The blend-smoker is on the left or right of the person whose birthday is in February. Since Parkour is in column 1, Blend can be in columns 2 or 3. February must be in column 4 (since Milk is already there).

#### 9. Use Clue 11 to place November:
- The person whose birthday is in November is on the left or right of the dunhill-smoker. Since Yellow and Dunhill are together, November must be in column 5.

#### 10. Use Clue 7 to place Yellow and Dunhill:
- The person who likes yellow smokes dunhill. Since Green is in column 2 and White is in column 4, Yellow must be in column 5 (the only available position).

- The pall-mall-smoker has a birthday in April. Since Green is in column 2, Pall-mall must be in column 2.

#### 12. Use Clue 13 to place Prince and Soccer:
- The person who plays soccer smokes prince. Since Tennis is in column 1, Soccer must be in column 4 (the only available position).

#### 13. Use Clue 15 to place Blend and Water:
- The blend-smoker is on the left or right of the person drinking water. Since Blend can be in columns 2 or 3, and Water must be in column 3.

#### 14. Use Clue 12 to place Bluemaster and Beer:
- The bluemaster-smoker drinks beer. Since Blend is in column 3, Bluemaster must be in column 5.
