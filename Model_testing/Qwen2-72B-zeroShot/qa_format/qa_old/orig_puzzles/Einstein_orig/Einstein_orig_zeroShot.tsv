Einstein_orig_1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we'll use the given clues to deduce the correct arrangement of houses and their occupants' characteristics. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **The Brit lives in a Red house.**
2. **The Swede keeps Dogs as pets.**
3. **The Dane drinks Tea.**
4. **The Green house is on the left of the White house.**
5. **The Green house owner drinks Coffee.**
6. **The owner who smokes Pall Mall rears Birds.**
7. **The owner of the Yellow house smokes Dunhill.**
8. **The owner living in the center house drinks Milk.**
9. **The Norwegian lives in the first house.**
10. **The owner who smokes Blend lives next to the one who keeps Cats.**
11. **The owner who keeps horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill.**
12. **The owner who smokes Bluemaster drinks Beer.**
13. **The German smokes Prince.**
14. **The Norwegian lives next to the Blue house.**
15. **The owner who smokes Blend has a neighbor who drinks Water.**

Let's start by placing the Norwegian in the first house and the Blue house next to it (clues 9 and 14):

- House 1: Norwegian
- House 2: Blue

Since the Green house is on the left of the White house (clue 4), we can place them as follows:

- House 3: Green
- House 4: White

The center house (House 3) drinks Milk (clue 8):

- House 3: Green, Milk

The Green house owner drinks Coffee (clue 5):

- House 3: Green, Coffee, Milk

This is a contradiction, so we need to adjust. Let's try:

- House 2: Blue
- House 3: Red (since the Brit lives in the Red house, clue 1)
- House 4: White
- House 5: Green

Now, let's fill in more details:

- House 1: Norwegian
- House 2: Blue
- House 3: Red, Milk (center house drinks Milk, clue 8)
- House 4: White
- House 5: Green, Coffee (Green house owner drinks Coffee, clue 5)

The Brit lives in the Red house:

- House 3: Brit, Red, Milk

The Swede keeps Dogs as pets:

- House 1: Norwegian
- House 2: Blue
- House 3: Brit, Red, Milk
- House 4: White
- House 5: Green, Coffee, Swede, Dogs (clue 2)

The Dane drinks Tea:

- House 1: Norwegian
- House 2: Blue, Danish, Tea (since the Dane drinks Tea, clue 3)
- House 3: Brit, Red, Milk
- House 4: White
- House 5: Green, Coffee, Swede, Dogs

The Yellow house owner smokes Dunhill:

- House 1: Norwegian, Yellow, Dunhill (clue 7)

The owner of the Blue house must be German and smoke Prince (clues 13 and 14):

- House 2: German, Blue, Prince
- House 3: Brit, Red, Milk

The center house drinks Milk:

- House 3: Brit, Red, Milk

The owner who smokes Pall Mall rears Birds (clue 6):

- House 4: White, Pall Mall, Birds

The owner who keeps horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill (clue 11):

- House 1: Norwegian, Yellow, Dunhill, Horses
- House 2: German, Blue, Prince
- House 3: Brit, Red, Milk
- House 4: White, Pall Mall, Birds
- House 5: Green, Coffee, Swede, Dogs

The owner who smokes Blend lives next to the one who keeps Cats (clue 10):

- House 2: German, Blue, Prince, Cats
- House 3: Brit, Red, Milk
- House 4: White, Pall Mall, Birds
- House 5: Green, Coffee, Swede, Dogs

The owner who smokes Blend has a neighbor who drinks Water (clue 15):

- House 2: German, Blue, Prince, Cats
- House 3: Brit, Red, Milk
- House 4: White, Pall Mall, Birds, Blend
- House 5: Green, Coffee, Swede, Dogs

The owner who smokes Bluemaster drinks Beer (clue 12):

- House 1: Norwegian, Yellow, Dunhill, Horses, Water
- House 2: German, Blue, Prince, Cats, Beer
- House 3: Brit, Red, Milk
- House 4: White, Pall Mall, Birds, Blend
- House 5: Green, Coffee, Swede, Dogs

Finally, the only remaining pet is Fish:

- House 1: Norwegian, Yellow, Dunhill, Horses, Water
- House 2: German, Blue, Prince, Cats, Beer
- House 3: Brit, Red, Milk, Fish
- House 4: White, Pall Mall, Birds, Blend
- House 5: Green, Coffee, Swede, Dogs

Thus, the Fish is in the **third** house.

Einstein_orig_2	"To solve this puzzle, we need to systematically deduce the arrangement of houses, nationalities, beverages, cigars, and pets based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **House Colors and Positions:**
   - The Norwegian lives in the first house (Clue 9).
   - The Green house is on the left of the White house (Clue 4).
   - The Norwegian lives next to the Blue house (Clue 14).

   From Clue 14, the second house must be Blue. Therefore:
   - House 1: Norwegian
   - House 2: Blue

   Since the Green house is on the left of the White house and cannot be the first or second house, it must be either the third or fourth house. The center house (third) drinks Milk (Clue 8), so the Green house cannot be the third house. Therefore:
   - House 3: Red (since the Brit lives in a Red house, Clue 1)
   - House 4: Green
   - House 5: White

2. **Nationalities:**
   - The Norwegian lives in the first house.
   - The Brit lives in the third house (Red).
   - The German smokes Prince (Clue 13), so he must live in either the fourth or fifth house.

   Since the Green house is the fourth house and its owner drinks Coffee (Clue 5), the German cannot live there. Therefore:
   - House 4: Green, not German
   - House 5: White, German

   The remaining nationalities are Dane and Swede. The Dane drinks Tea (Clue 3), so he must live in either the second or fifth house. Since the fifth house is already taken by the German:
   - House 2: Blue, Dane
   - House 5: White, German
   - House 1: Norwegian
   - House 3: Red, Brit

3. **Beverages:**
   - The center house (third) drinks Milk.
   - The Green house (fourth) drinks Coffee.
   - The Norwegian lives in the first house and must drink Water (Clue 15).
   - The Dane drinks Tea.
   - The remaining beverage is Beer, which must be drunk by the person who smokes Bluemaster (Clue 12).

4. **Cigars:**
   - The owner of the Yellow house smokes Dunhill (Clue 7). Since the first house is Norwegian and the second house is Blue, the Yellow house must be the fifth house.
   - The German lives in the White house and smokes Prince.
   - The person who drinks Beer smokes Bluemaster (Clue 12).
   - The owner of the Green house smokes Pall Mall (Clue 6).

5. **Pets:**
   - The Swede keeps Dogs (Clue 2). Since the Norwegian lives in the first house and the German lives in the fifth house, the Swede must live in either the second or third house. However, the Brit lives in the third house, so:
     - House 1: Norwegian
     - House 2: Blue, Dane
     - House 3: Red, Brit
     - House 4: Green, Pall Mall, Coffee
     - House 5: White, German, Prince

   The owner who smokes Blend lives next to the one who keeps Cats (Clue 10). Since the only remaining houses are the first and second, the Norwegian must smoke Blend.
   - The owner of the Yellow house (fifth) smokes Dunhill and keeps Horses (Clue 11).
   - The Dane drinks Tea and rears Birds (Clue 6).

6. **Final Arrangement:**
   - House 1: Norwegian, Water, Blend, Cats
   - House 2: Blue, Dane, Tea, Pall Mall, Birds
   - House 3: Red, Brit, Milk, Bluemaster, Beer
   - House 4: Green, Coffee, Pall Mall, Fish
   - House 5: White, German, Prince, Water, Horses

### Answer:
The owner of the fourth house keeps Fish. Therefore, the answer is:
**Fish:4**"	Fish:4
Einstein_orig_3	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each piece of information into a grid or list to track the relationships between houses, colors, nationalities, beverages, cigars, and pets. Let's break it down step by step.

   - The Norwegian lives next to the Blue house (14), so House 2 must be Blue.
   - Since House 1 is not Red (it's Norwegian) and House 3 is not Red (it drinks Milk), House 5 must be Red (the only remaining house for the Brit).

4. **Update the grid:**
   - House 1: Norwegian, Yellow
   - House 2: Blue
   - House 3: Milk
   - House 4: Green

   - The owner who smokes Bluemaster drinks Beer (12), and since the only remaining house for Bluemaster is House 2, House 2 drinks Beer.
   - The Dane drinks Tea (3), and since the only remaining house for the Dane is House 1, House 1 has Tea.

10. **Update the grid:**
    - House 1: Norwegian, Yellow, Dunhill, Tea
    - House 2: Blue, Horses, Beer, Bluemaster
    - House 3: Milk, Pall Mall, Birds
    - House 4: Green, German, Coffee, Prince, Cats
    - House 5: Red, Brit, Dogs, Blend

11. **Determine the remaining pet:**
