Einstein_1domain_replacements_0	"To solve this puzzle, we need to use a process of elimination and logical deduction based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - We have 5 positions (1 to 5).
   - Each position has a person with a specific nationality, favorite color, hobby, cigar brand, and pet.

2. **Clue Analysis:**
   - **Clue 9:** The Norwegian is on the far left.
     - Position 1: Norwegian
   - **Clue 14:** The Norwegian is on the left or right of the person who likes blue.
     - Since the Norwegian is in position 1, the person who likes blue must be in position 2.
   - **Clue 8:** The person whose hobby is filmmaking is in the middle.
     - Position 3: Filmmaking
   - **Clue 1:** The British is the person who likes red.
     - Since the Norwegian (position 1) and blue (position 2) are already taken, the British cannot be in positions 1 or 2. Therefore, the British must be in position 4 or 5.

3. **Color and Position Deductions:**
   - **Clue 4:** The person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white.
     - Since blue is in position 2, green cannot be in position 1 (Norwegian). Therefore, green must be in position 3 or 4.
     - If green is in position 3, then white must be in position 4 or 5.
   - **Clue 5:** The person who likes green is the person whose hobby is fishing.
     - Since filmmaking is in position 3, green cannot be in position 3. Therefore, green must be in position 4, and white must be in position 5.

4. **Nationality and Position Deductions:**
   - Since green is in position 4, the British (red) must be in position 5.
     - Position 4: Green
     - Position 5: Red (British)
   - The person who likes white is in position 5, but since red is already there, white must be in position 3 or 4. Since green is in position 4, white must be in position 3.

5. **Hobby and Position Deductions:**
   - **Clue 12:** The Bluemaster-smoker is the person whose hobby is woodworking.
     - Woodworking cannot be in positions 1 (Norwegian), 3 (Filmmaking), or 4 (Green). Therefore, it must be in position 5.
     - Position 5: Red (British), Woodworking, Bluemaster
   - **Clue 7:** The Pall-Mall-smoker is the owner of the bird.
     - Bird cannot be in positions 1 (Norwegian), 3 (Filmmaking), or 5 (Red). Therefore, it must be in position 4.
     - Position 4: Green, Pall-Mall, Bird
   - **Clue 6:** The person who likes yellow is the Dunhill-smoker.
     - Yellow cannot be in positions 1 (Norwegian), 3 (Filmmaking), 4 (Green), or 5 (Red). Therefore, it must be in position 2.
     - Position 2: Blue, Yellow, Dunhill

6. **Remaining Deductions:**
   - The person who likes white is in position 3.
     - Since green is in position 4 and red is in position 5, the person who likes white must be in position 3.
     - Position 3: White, Filmmaking
   - The German is the Prince-smoker.
     - Since positions 1 (Norwegian), 2 (Yellow), 3 (White), and 5 (Red) are already taken, the German must be in position 4.
     - Position 4: Green, Pall-Mall, Bird, German
   - The Swedish is the owner of the dog.
     - Since positions 1 (Norwegian), 2 (Yellow), 3 (White), and 4 (Green) are already taken, the Swedish must be in position 5.
     - Position 5: Red, Woodworking, Bluemaster, British

7. **Final Deductions:**
   - The Danish is the person whose hobby is chess.
     - Since positions 1 (Norwegian), 3 (White), 4 (Green), and 5 (Red) are already taken, the Danish must be in position 2.
     - Position 2: Blue, Yellow, Dunhill, Danish, Chess
   - The person who likes blue is in position 2.
     - Since positions 1 (Norwegian), 3 (White), 4 (Green), and 5 (Red) are already taken, the person who likes blue must be in position 2.

8. **Pet and Cigar Deductions:**
   - The blend-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the cat.
     - Since positions 1 (Norwegian), 3 (White), and 5 (Red) are already taken, the blend-smoker must be in position 2 or 4.
     - If the blend-smoker is in position 2, the cat must be in position 1 or 3. If the blend-smoker is in position 4, the cat must be in position 3 or 5.
   - The owner of the horses is on the left or right of the Dunhill-smoker.
     - Since the Dunhill-smoker is in position 2, the horse must be in position 1 or 3.
   - The blend-smoker is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is photography.
     - Since positions 1 (Norwegian), 3 (White), and 5 (Red) are already taken, the blend-smoker must be in position 2 or 4. If the blend-smoker is in position 2, the photography must be in position 1 or 3. If the blend-smoker is in position 4, the photography must be in position 3 or 5.

### Final Solution:
- **Position 1:** Norwegian, Blue, Dunhill, Chess, Cat
- **Position 2:** Danish, Yellow, Pall-Mall, Bird, Horse
- **Position 3:** German, White, Blend, Filmmaking, Photography
- **Position 4:** British, Green, Prince, Woodworking, Fish
