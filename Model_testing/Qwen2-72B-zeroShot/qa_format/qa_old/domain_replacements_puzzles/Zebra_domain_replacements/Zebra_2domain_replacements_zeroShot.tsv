Zebra_2domain_replacements_0	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to use the given clues and systematically deduce the correct arrangement for each category (city, color, cigar brand, job, pet). Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. The person traveling to Berlin is the person who likes red.
2. The person traveling to Nizza is the owner of the dog.
3. The architect is the person who likes green.
4. The person traveling to Marseilles is the dancer.

12. The lucky-strike smoker is the project manager.
13. The person traveling to Colone is the parliaments smoker.
14. The person traveling to London is to the left or right of the person who likes blue.

Let's start by placing the known positions:

- **London** is on the far left (Clue 9).
- **Social worker** is in the middle (Clue 8).

We can represent the positions as follows:
1. London
2.
3. Social worker
4.
5. Colone

Now, let's use Clue 1 and place Berlin:
- The person traveling to Berlin likes red (Clue 1).

Since Berlin is not on the far left or in the middle, it must be in position 4:
1. London
2.
3. Social worker
4. Berlin (Red)
5. Colone

Next, let's use Clue 7 and place the kools smoker:
- The kools smoker likes yellow (Clue 7).

Since the social worker is in the middle, the kools smoker cannot be there. Therefore, the kools smoker must be in position 2 or 3. However, since the social worker is in position 3, the kools smoker must be in position 2:
1. London
2. Kools (Yellow)
3. Social worker
4. Berlin (Red)
5. Colone

Now, let's use Clue 6 and place the old-gold smoker:
- The old-gold smoker owns snails (Clue 6).

The old-gold smoker cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (since kools and social worker are there). Therefore, the old-gold smoker must be in position 5:
1. London
2. Kools (Yellow)
3. Social worker
4. Berlin (Red)
5. Colone (Old-gold, Snails)

Next, let's use Clue 13 and place the parliaments smoker:
- The person traveling to Colone is the parliaments smoker (Clue 13).

This confirms that position 5 is:
1. London
2. Kools (Yellow)
3. Social worker
4. Berlin (Red)
5. Colone (Parliaments, Snails)

Now, let's use Clue 3 and place the architect:
- The architect likes green (Clue 3).

Since the social worker is in position 3, the architect must be in position 2 or 4. However, since Berlin is red, the architect must be in position 2:
1. London
2. Kools (Yellow), Architect
3. Social worker
4. Berlin (Red)
5. Colone (Parliaments, Snails)

Next, let's use Clue 5 and place the person who likes ivory:
- The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory (Clue 5).

Since the architect likes green and is in position 2, the person who likes ivory must be in position 1:
1. London (Ivory)
2. Kools (Yellow), Architect
3. Social worker
4. Berlin (Red)
5. Colone (Parliaments, Snails)

Now, let's use Clue 14 and place the person who likes blue:
- The person traveling to London is to the left or right of the person who likes blue (Clue 14).

Since London is in position 1, the person who likes blue must be in position 2 or 3. However, since the architect is in position 2, the person who likes blue must be in position 3:
1. London (Ivory)
2. Kools (Yellow), Architect
3. Social worker (Blue)
4. Berlin (Red)
5. Colone (Parliaments, Snails)

Next, let's use Clue 10 and place the chesterfields smoker:
- The chesterfields smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox (Clue 10).

Since the social worker is in position 3, the chesterfields smoker must be in position 2 or 4. However, since the architect is in position 2, the chesterfields smoker must be in position 4:
1. London (Ivory)
2. Kools (Yellow), Architect
3. Social worker (Blue)
4. Berlin (Red), Chesterfields
5. Colone (Parliaments, Snails)

Now, let's use Clue 11 and place the kools smoker:
- The kools smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse (Clue 11).

Since the kools smoker is in position 2, the owner of the horse must be in position 1 or 3. However, since London is in position 1 and the social worker is in position 3, the owner of the horse must be in position 1:
1. London (Ivory, Horse)
2. Kools (Yellow), Architect
3. Social worker (Blue)
4. Berlin (Red), Chesterfields
5. Colone (Parliaments, Snails)

Next, let's use Clue 12 and place the lucky-strike smoker:
- The lucky-strike smoker is the project manager (Clue 12).

Since the social worker is in position 3, the project manager must be in position 4:
1. London (Ivory, Horse)
2. Kools (Yellow), Architect
3. Social worker (Blue)
4. Berlin (Red), Chesterfields, Project Manager
5. Colone (Parliaments, Snails)

Finally, let's place the remaining pet, zebra:
- The only pet left is the zebra, which must be in position 3.

Therefore, the final arrangement is:
1. London (Ivory, Horse)
2. Kools (Yellow), Architect
3. Social worker (Blue, Zebra)
4. Berlin (Red), Chesterfields, Project Manager
5. Colone (Parliaments, Snails)

So, the zebra is in position 3.

   - Position 3: Surfing

### Step 2: Placing Other Elements Based on Clues

3. **Clue 5**: The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.

4. **Clue 3**: The person who's sport is skiing is the person who likes green.
   - Since surfing is in position 3, skiing must be in position 2 or 4. Given clue 5, if green is in position 4, then ivory must be in position 3 (but it can't because surfing is there), so green must be in position 2 and ivory in position 1.
   - Position 1: Ivory
   - Position 2: Green, Skiing

10. **Clue 2**: The person eating lime is the owner of the dog.
    - Dog cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (already occupied), so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position 1 (Tomato):**
   - The person eating tomato is on the far left (clue 9).
   - This person must be next to the person who likes blue (clue 14).

2. **Position 3 (Photography):**
   - The person whose hobby is photography is in the middle (position 3) (clue 8).

3. **Position 5 (Red/Cranberry):**
   - The person eating cranberry is the person who likes red (clue 1).
   - Since the person eating tomato is on the far left, and this person must be next to the person who likes blue, the person who likes blue cannot be in position 2.
   - Therefore, the person who likes blue must be in position 5.
   - The person who likes red (and eats cranberry) must be in position 4.

4. **Position 4 (Red/Cranberry):**
   - The person eating cranberry is in position 4 (clue 1).
   - This person also likes red.

5. **Position 2 (Green/Collecting):**
   - The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory (clue 5).
   - The person who likes green must be in position 2.
   - Therefore, the person who likes ivory must be in position 1 or 3.
   - Since position 3 is occupied by the photography hobbyist, the person who likes ivory must be in position 1.

6. **Position 1 (Tomato/Ivory):**
   - The person eating tomato is also the person who likes ivory (clue 9).

7. **Position 3 (Photography/Blue):**
   - The person whose hobby is photography is in position 3.
   - This person must like blue (since the person who likes red is in position 4 and the person who likes green is in position 2).

8. **Position 5 (Red/Cranberry/Blue):**
   - The person who likes blue is in position 5 (clue 14).
   - This person cannot be the same as the person who eats tomato or the person who likes red.
   - Therefore, the person who likes blue must be in position 5.

9. **Position 2 (Green/Collecting):**
   - The person who likes green is in position 2 (clue 3).
   - This person's hobby is collecting.

10. **Position 4 (Red/Cranberry/Snails/Old-Gold):**
    - The old-gold-smoker is the owner of the snails (clue 6).
    - Since the person eating cranberry is in position 4, this person must be the old-gold-smoker and the owner of the snails.

11. **Position 3 (Photography/Kools/Horse):**
    - The kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse (clue 11).
    - The person whose hobby is photography is in position 3.
    - Therefore, the kools-smoker must be in position 2 or 4.
    - Since the old-gold-smoker is in position 4, the kools-smoker must be in position 2.
    - The person who likes green (in position 2) must also smoke kools and own the horse.

12. **Position 5 (Red/Cranberry/Snails/Old-Gold):**
    - The lucky-strike-smoker is the person whose hobby is skydiving (clue 12).
    - This person must be in position 5.
