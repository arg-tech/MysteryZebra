Let's start by listing out all the given information:

1. The English person likes red.
2. The Spanish person owns the dog.
3. The person who drinks coffee likes green.
4. The Ukrainian person drinks tea.
5. The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.
6. The Old Gold smoker owns snails.
7. The Kools smoker likes yellow.
8. The person who drinks milk is in the middle.
9. The Norwegian is on the far left.
10. The Chesterfields smoker is next to the owner of the fox.
11. The Kools smoker is next to the owner of the horse.
12. The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
13. The Japanese person smokes Parliaments.
14. The Norwegian is next to the person who likes blue.

Now, let's organize this information step by step:

### Step 1: Initial Placement
- **Norwegian** is on the far left (House 1).
- **Milk** drinker is in the middle (House 3).

### Step 2: Place English and Red
- The **English** person likes **red**. Since the Norwegian is on the far left, the English person cannot be there. Let's place the English person in House 2 (the only available house next to the Norwegian).

### Step 3: Place Spanish and Dog
- The **Spanish** person owns the **dog**. Since the Norwegian is on the far left and the English person is in House 2, the Spanish person must be in one of the remaining houses (House 4 or 5). Let's place the Spanish person in House 4.

### Step 4: Place Ukrainian and Tea
- The **Ukrainian** person drinks **tea**. Since the Norwegian is on the far left and the English person is in House 2, the Ukrainian person must be in one of the remaining houses (House 3 or 5). Let's place the Ukrainian person in House 5.

### Step 5: Place Green and Coffee
- The person who drinks **coffee** likes **green**. Since the Norwegian is on the far left and the English person is in House 2, the coffee drinker must be in one of the remaining houses (House 3 or 4). Let's place the coffee drinker in House 4.

### Step 6: Place Ivory
- The person who likes **green** is to the right of the person who likes **ivory**. Since the coffee drinker (who likes green) is in House 4, the person who likes ivory must be in House 3.

### Step 7: Place Yellow and Kools
- The **Kools** smoker likes **yellow**. Since the Norwegian is on the far left and the English person is in House 2, the Kools smoker must be in one of the remaining houses (House 3 or 5). Let's place the Kools smoker in House 3.

### Step 8: Place Old Gold and Snails
- The **Old Gold** smoker owns **snails**. Since the Norwegian is on the far left and the English person is in House 2, the Old Gold smoker must be in one of the remaining houses (House 4 or 5). Let's place the Old Gold smoker in House 5.

### Step 9: Place Chesterfields and Fox
- The **Chesterfields** smoker is next to the owner of the **fox**. Since the Norwegian is on the far left and the English person is in House 2, the Chesterfields smoker must be in one of the remaining houses (House 3 or 4). Let's place the Chesterfields smoker in House 4.

### Step 10: Place Lucky Strike and Orange Juice
- The **Lucky Strike** smoker drinks **orange juice**. Since the Norwegian is on the far left and the English person is in House 2, the Lucky Strike smoker must be in one of the remaining houses (House 3 or 5). Let's place the Lucky Strike smoker in House 5.

### Step 11: Place Japanese and Parliaments
- The **Japanese** person smokes **Parliaments**. Since the Norwegian is on the far left and the English person is in House 2, the Japanese person must be in one of the remaining houses (House 3 or 4). Let's place the Japanese person in House 3.

### Step 12: Place Water
- The **Norwegian** is next to the person who likes **blue**. Since the Norwegian is on the far left, the person who likes blue must be in House 2. Therefore, the **water** drinker must be in House 1 (the only remaining house).

### Final Arrangement:
1. **Norwegian**: Blue, Water
2. **English**: Red, Milk
3. **Japanese**: Green, Coffee, Parliaments
4. **Spanish**: Ivory, Tea, Kools, Dog
5. **Ukrainian**: Yellow, Orange Juice, Chesterfields

So, the answer is:
**water:1**"	water:1
Zebra_orig_NL_2	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each piece of information into a coherent arrangement. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - We have 5 positions (1 to 5).
   - Each position will have a nationality, favorite color, cigar brand, beverage, and pet.

2. **Clues Analysis:**
   - **Clue 9:** The Norwegian is on the far left (Position 1).
   - **Clue 8:** The person drinking milk is in the middle (Position 3).

3. **Clue 14:** The Norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue.
   - Since the Norwegian is in Position 1, the person who likes blue must be in Position 2.

4. **Clue 5:** The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.
   - This means the person who likes ivory cannot be in Position 5 (no one can be to the right of them). Therefore, the possible positions for ivory are 1, 2, or 3.
   - Since Position 1 and 3 are already occupied (Norwegian and milk), the only possible position for ivory is Position 2.
   - Therefore, green must be in Position 3.

5. **Clue 3:** The person drinking coffee is the person who likes green.
   - Since green is in Position 3, the person drinking coffee is also in Position 3.

6. **Clue 4:** The Ukrainian is the person drinking tea.
   - Tea must be in one of the remaining positions (1, 2, 4, or 5). Since milk is in Position 3 and coffee is in Position 3, tea cannot be in Position 3.
   - The Norwegian is in Position 1, so tea cannot be in Position 1.
   - Therefore, tea must be in either Position 2 or 4. However, since blue is in Position 2, tea must be in Position 4.

7. **Clue 1:** The English person likes red.
   - Red must be in one of the remaining positions (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). Since green is in Position 3 and blue is in Position 2, red cannot be in Position 2 or 3.
   - Therefore, red must be in either Position 1, 4, or 5. However, the Norwegian is in Position 1, so red cannot be in Position 1.
   - Since tea is in Position 4, red must be in Position 5.

8. **Clue 2:** The Spanish person owns the dog.
   - The dog must be in one of the remaining positions (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). Since milk is in Position 3 and tea is in Position 4, the dog cannot be in Position 3 or 4.
   - Therefore, the dog must be in either Position 1, 2, or 5. However, the Norwegian is in Position 1 and red is in Position 5, so the dog must be in Position 2.

9. **Clue 7:** The Kools smoker likes yellow.
   - Yellow must be in one of the remaining positions (1, 3, 4, or 5). Since green is in Position 3, blue is in Position 2, and red is in Position 5, yellow cannot be in Position 2, 3, or 5.
   - Therefore, yellow must be in Position 4.

10. **Clue 11:** The Kools smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse.
    - Since Kools is in Position 4, the horse must be in either Position 3 or 5.
    - However, red is in Position 5, so the horse must be in Position 3.

11. **Clue 6:** The Old Gold smoker owns snails.
    - Snails must be in one of the remaining positions (1, 2, 4, or 5). Since dog is in Position 2, horse is in Position 3, and yellow is in Position 4, snails cannot be in Position 2, 3, or 4.
    - Therefore, snails must be in Position 1.

12. **Clue 10:** The Chesterfields smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox.
    - Fox must be in one of the remaining positions (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). Since dog is in Position 2, horse is in Position 3, and yellow is in Position 4, fox cannot be in Position 2, 3, or 4.
    - Therefore, fox must be in either Position 1 or 5. However, snails are in Position 1, so the fox must be in Position 5.

13. **Clue 12:** The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
    - Orange juice must be in one of the remaining positions (1, 2, 4, or 5). Since tea is in Position 4, snails are in Position 1, and red is in Position 5, orange juice cannot be in Position 1, 4, or 5.
    - Therefore, orange juice must be in Position 2.

14. **Clue 13:** The Japanese person smokes Parliaments.
    - Since the only remaining position for Parliaments is Position 5, the Japanese person must be in Position 5.

### Final Arrangement:
1. Norwegian (Blue, Water, Snails, Old Gold)
2. Ukrainian (Ivory, Orange Juice, Dog, Chesterfields)
3. English (Red, Coffee, Horse, Lucky Strike)
4. Spanish (Yellow, Tea, Fox, Kools)
5. Japanese (Green, Milk, Zebra, Parliaments)

- Position 1: Beverage = Water (since all other beverages are already assigned)
- Position 1: Pet = Snails
- Position 1: Cigar = Old Gold
- Position 1: Nationality = Norwegian
- Position 1: Color = Blue

So, the final grid looks like this:

| Position | 1         | 2         | 3         | 4         | 5         |

   - If green is in position 5, ivory must be in position 4.

6. **Kools and Yellow:**
   - The Kools smoker likes yellow.
   - Yellow cannot be in position 1 (Norwegian) or 3 (milk).
   - Therefore, yellow must be in one of positions 2, 4, or 5.

7. **Old Gold and Snails:**
   - The Old Gold smoker owns snails.
   - Snails cannot be in position 3 (milk).

8. **Ukrainian and Tea:**

   - The Chesterfields smoker is next to the owner of the fox.
   - Fox cannot be in position 1 (Norwegian) or 3 (milk).

10. **Lucky Strike and Orange Juice:**
    - The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
    - Orange juice cannot be in position 1 (Norwegian) or 3 (milk).
    - Therefore, orange juice must be in one of positions 2, 4, or 5.

11. **Japanese and Parliaments:**
    - The Japanese person smokes Parliaments.
    - Parliaments cannot be in position 1 (Norwegian) or 3 (milk).
    - Therefore, Parliaments must be in one of positions 2, 4, or 5.

12. **Norwegian and Blue:**
    - The Norwegian is next to the person who likes blue.
    - Blue cannot be in position 1 (Norwegian) or 3 (milk).
    - Therefore, blue must be in position 2 or 5.

### Final Deduction:

- Position 1: Norwegian, water, Old Gold, snails
- Position 2: Blue, tea, Chesterfields, fox
- Position 3: Milk, English, red, horse
