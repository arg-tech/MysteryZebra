15. **chaman-smoker is next to the almond-milk drinker**

Let's start by placing the known positions:

- Chinese in position 1
- Soy-milk drinker in position 3

From clue 9, we know:
- Position 1: Chinese

From clue 8, we know:
- Position 3: Soy-milk drinker

Now, let's use clue 14 to place the lavender color:
- The Chinese (position 1) is next to the person who likes lavender.
- Therefore, position 2 must be the person who likes lavender.

From clue 1, we know:
- Malaysian likes apricot.
- Since the Chinese are in position 1, Malaysian cannot be in position 1. Let's check other positions for Malaysian and apricot.

From clue 4 and 5, we know:
- The person who likes light-blue drinks fanta and is to the left of the person who likes blood-red.
- This means light-blue must be in one of the first three positions (since soy-milk drinker is in position 3).

Let's assume:
- Position 2: Lavender
- Position 3: Soy-milk

From clue 5, we know:
- The person who drinks fanta likes light-blue.
- Therefore, light-blue must be in one of the first two positions (since soy-milk is in position 3).

Let's assume:
- Position 1: Chinese
- Position 2: Lavender
- Position 3: Soy-milk

From clue 4 and 5, we know:
- The person who likes light-blue drinks fanta and is to the left of the person who likes blood-red.
- Therefore, position 2 must be light-blue and position 4 must be blood-red.

Now we have:
- Position 1: Chinese
- Position 2: Light-blue (fanta)
- Position 3: Soy-milk
- Position 4: Blood-red

From clue 1, we know:
- Malaysian likes apricot.
- Therefore, Malaysian cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Let's place Malaysian in position 5.

Now we have:
- Position 1: Chinese
- Position 2: Light-blue (fanta)
- Position 3: Soy-milk
- Position 4: Blood-red

- Position 2: Light-blue (fanta) (rabbit)
- Position 3: Soy-milk (emerald)

From clue 10, we know:
- The chaman-smoker is next to the turtle owner.

- Position 3: Soy-milk (emerald)

- Position 4: Blood-red (swisher-smoker, frog)
- Position 5: Malaysian (apricot) (vegafina, mirinda)
