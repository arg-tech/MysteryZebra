Einstein_2domain_replacements_0	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the corresponding information into a grid. Let's start by setting up the grid:

| Position | 1 (Left) | 2         | 3 (Middle) | 4        | 5 (Right) |
|----------|----------|-----------|------------|----------|----------|
| Nationality | Norwegian |          |            |          |          |
| Color    |          |           | Red (British) |          |          |

| Food     |          |           |            |          |          |

Einstein_2domain_replacements_1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to systematically place each attribute (color, sport, beverage, cigar brand, and birthday month) for each of the 5 people. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify initial placements based on direct statements:**
   - The person who likes green is drinking coffee (statement 5).
   - The person who likes red is playing tennis (statement 1).
   - The person who plays snowboarding has a birthday in January (statement 2).
   - The person who plays skateboarding drinks tea (statement 3).
   - The person who drinks milk is in the middle (statement 8).

2. **Place the parkour player:**
   - The person who plays parkour is on the far left (statement 9).

3. **Identify the positions of other people based on relative placements:**
   - The person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white (statement 4).
   - The pall-mall smoker has a birthday in April (statement 6).
   - The yellow lover is the dunhill smoker (statement 7).

4. **Place the blend smoker and February:**
   - The blend smoker is on the left or right of the person who has a birthday in February (statement 10).

5. **Place the November birthday:**
   - The person with a November birthday is on the left or right of the dunhill smoker (statement 11).

6. **Place the bluemaster and beer:**
   - The bluemaster smoker drinks beer (statement 12).

7. **Place the soccer player and prince:**
   - The person who plays soccer is the prince smoker (statement 13).

8. **Place the parkour player and blue:**
   - The person who plays parkour is on the left or right of the person who likes blue (statement 14).

9. **Place the blend smoker and water:**
   - The blend smoker is on the left or right of the person drinking water (statement 15).

Let's start placing these step by step:

- **Position 1 (far left):** Parkour
- **Position 3 (middle):** Milk drinker

Since the person who likes green drinks coffee and must be to the left of the person who likes white, we can place them as follows:
- **Green:** Coffee, Position 2 or 4
- **White:** Position 4 or 2

The person who plays tennis likes red, so:
- **Red:** Tennis, Position 5 (since green and white must be adjacent and one of them is in the middle)

The person who plays snowboarding has a birthday in January:
- **January:** Snowboarding, Position 1 or 3 (but not 3 since milk drinker is there)

Since parkour is on the far left:
- **January:** Snowboarding, Position 1

Now, we know:
- **Position 1:** Parkour, Snowboarding, January
- **Position 3:** Milk drinker

The pall-mall smoker has a birthday in April and must be placed:
- **April:** Pall-mall, Position 2 or 4 (since green is next to white)

The yellow lover is the dunhill smoker:
- **Yellow:** Dunhill, Position 2 or 4 (since green is next to white)

Since the blend smoker is on the left or right of February and November:
- **Blend:** Position 2 or 4
- **February:** Position 1, 3, or 5
- **November:** Position 1, 3, or 5

The bluemaster smoker drinks beer:
- **Beer:** Bluemaster, Position 2 or 4 (since green is next to white)

The soccer player is the prince smoker:
- **Soccer:** Prince, Position 2 or 4 (since green is next to white)

The parkour player is on the left or right of blue:
- **Blue:** Position 2 or 4

The blend smoker is on the left or right of water:
- **Water:** Position 1, 3, or 5

After placing all these constraints, we can deduce the following:

- **Position 1:** Parkour, Snowboarding, January
- **Position 2:** Green, Coffee, Pall-mall, April
- **Position 3:** Milk drinker
- **Position 4:** White, Water, Blend, February
- **Position 5:** Red, Tennis, Blue, Beer, Bluemaster

Since the only month left for Position 3 is June, we have:
- **June:3**

Thus, the answer is:
**june:3**"	june:4	june:3	False	True
