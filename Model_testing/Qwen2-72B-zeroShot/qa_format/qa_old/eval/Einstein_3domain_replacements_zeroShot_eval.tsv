**fish:3**"	fish:4	fish:3	False	True
Einstein_3domain_replacements_1	"To solve this puzzle, we need to systematically place each person based on the given clues. Let's break down the information and use a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Set up the initial grid
We will create a grid with columns for:
- City
- Favorite Color
- Birthday Month
- Cigar Brand

Each row represents one of the five people.

| Person | City          | Favorite Color | Birthday Month | Cigar Brand | Job        |
|--------|---------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|------------|
| 1      |               |                |                |             |            |

| 3      |               |                |                |             |            |
| 4      |               |                |                |             |            |
| 5      |               |                |                |             |            |

### Step 2: Apply the clues
Let's apply each clue one by one:

   - New York -> Red

2. **The person traveling to Nizza is the dressmaker.**
   - Nizza -> Dressmaker

3. **The person traveling to San Francisco is the person whose birthday is in February.**
   - San Francisco -> February

4. **The person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white.**
   - Green -> Left of White

5. **The person who likes green is the person whose birthday is in March.**
   - Green -> March

6. **The Pall Mall smoker is the dancer.**
   - Pall Mall -> Dancer

    - Blend -> Next to May

### Step 3: Fill in the grid
Let's start filling in the grid based on the clues:

- Person 1 (Prague) cannot be next to New York (Red), so Person 2 must be New York.
- Person 3 is July, and it must be in the middle.
- Green is March, and it must be left of White. Therefore, Person 4 or 5 can be White.
- Yellow is Dunhill, and it must be next to the Librarian.
- Bluemaster is November, and it must be next to the Blend smoker.

Let's fill in what we know:

5. **Country and Coffee:**
   - The fan of country is the person drinking coffee (Clue 5).
   - This can't be Position 1 (July) or Position 3 (Milk), so it must be either Position 2, 4, or 5.

6. **Salsa:**
   - The fan of salsa must be at Position 3 or 4.
   - Since the person drinking milk is in the middle (Position 3), the fan of salsa must be at Position 4.

7. **Musician and Bird:**
   - The musician is the owner of the bird (Clue 6).
   - This can't be Position 1 (July) or Position 3 (Milk), so it must be either Position 2, 4, or 5.

8. **Soul and Photographer:**
   - The fan of soul is the photographer (Clue 7).
   - This can't be Position 1 (July) or Position 3 (Milk), so it must be either Position 2, 4, or 5.

9. **Teacher and Beer:**
   - The teacher is the person drinking beer (Clue 12).
   - This can't be Position 1 (July), Position 3 (Milk), or Position 5 (Photographer, fan of soul), so it must be either Position 2 or 4.

10. **December and Police-Officer:**
    - The person who's birthday is in December is the police-officer (Clue 13).

11. **Paramedic and Water:**
    - The paramedic is on the left or right of the person drinking water (Clue 15).
    - This can't be Position 1 (July), Position 3 (Milk), or Position 5 (Photographer, fan of soul), so it must be either Position 2 or 4.
