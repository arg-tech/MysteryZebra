Einstein_orig_NL_1	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and cross-reference each clue to determine the correct arrangement of the five houses and their attributes. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Initial Setup
We have 5 positions (1 to 5) for the houses, and we need to assign a color, nationality, beverage, cigar brand, and pet to each position.

### Step 2: Applying Clues

1. **The British is the person who likes red.**
   - Position of British = Position of Red

2. **The Swedish is the owner of the dog.**
   - Position of Swedish = Position of Dog

3. **The Danish is the person drinking tea.**
   - Position of Danish = Position of Tea

4. **The person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white.**
   - Green < White (in terms of position)

5. **The person who likes green is the person drinking coffee.**
   - Position of Green = Position of Coffee

6. **The Pall-Mall smoker is the owner of the bird.**
   - Position of Pall-Mall = Position of Bird

7. **The person who likes yellow is the Dunhill smoker.**
   - Position of Yellow = Position of Dunhill

8. **The person drinking milk is in the middle.**
   - Milk = Position 3

9. **The Norwegian is on the far left.**
   - Norwegian = Position 1

10. **The Blend smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the cat.**
    - |Position of Blend - Position of Cat| = 1

11. **The owner of the horses is on the left or right of the Dunhill smoker.**
    - |Position of Horses - Position of Dunhill| = 1

12. **The Bluemaster smoker is the person drinking beer.**
    - Position of Bluemaster = Position of Beer

13. **The German is the Prince smoker.**
    - Position of German = Position of Prince

14. **The Norwegian is on the left or right of the person who likes blue.**
    - |Position of Norwegian - Position of Blue| = 1

15. **The Blend smoker is on the left or right of the person drinking water.**
    - |Position of Blend - Position of Water| = 1

### Step 3: Solving the Puzzle

1. **Norwegian in Position 1**:
   - Norwegian = Position 1
   - Blue must be either Position 2 (since Norwegian is on the left or right of blue).

2. **Milk in Position 3**:
   - Milk = Position 3

3. **Green < White and Green = Coffee**:
   - Green cannot be Position 5 (since it must be to the left of White).
   - Green cannot be Position 1 (Norwegian is there).
   - Green cannot be Position 3 (Milk is there).
   - Therefore, Green must be Position 2 or 4.
   - If Green is Position 2, then White must be Position 3 or 4. But Milk is in Position 3, so White must be Position 4.

4. **British and Red**:
   - British = Red
   - Since Green is to the left of White, Red cannot be Position 1 (Norwegian) or Position 2 (Green), so Red must be Position 5.
   - Therefore, British = Position 5

5. **Swedish and Dog**:
   - Swedish = Dog
   - Swedish cannot be Position 1 (Norwegian), Position 3 (Milk), or Position 5 (British/Red).
   - Therefore, Swedish = Position 4
   - Dog = Position 4

6. **Danish and Tea**:
   - Danish = Tea
   - Danish cannot be Position 1 (Norwegian), Position 3 (Milk), or Position 4 (Swedish/Dog).
   - Therefore, Danish = Position 2
   - Tea = Position 2

7. **Green = Coffee and Green = Position 2**:
   - Coffee = Position 2

8. **Yellow and Dunhill**:
   - Yellow = Dunhill
   - Yellow cannot be Position 1 (Norwegian), Position 2 (Green/Coffee/Danish/Tea), or Position 3 (Milk).
   - Therefore, Yellow = Position 4
   - Dunhill = Position 4

9. **Pall-Mall and Bird**:
   - Pall-Mall = Bird
   - Pall-Mall cannot be Position 1 (Norwegian), Position 2 (Green/Coffee/Danish/Tea), Position 3 (Milk), or Position 4 (Yellow/Dunhill/Swedish/Dog).
   - Therefore, Pall-Mall = Position 5
   - Bird = Position 5

10. **Bluemaster and Beer**:
    - Bluemaster = Beer
    - Bluemaster cannot be Position 1 (Norwegian), Position 2 (Green/Coffee/Danish/Tea), Position 3 (Milk), or Position 4 (Yellow/Dunhill/Swedish/Dog).
    - Therefore, Bluemaster = Position 5
    - Beer = Position 5

11. **German and Prince**:
    - German = Prince
    - German cannot be Position 1 (Norwegian), Position 2 (Green/Coffee/Danish/Tea), Position 3 (Milk), or Position 4 (Yellow/Dunhill/Swedish/Dog).
    - Therefore, German = Position 5
    - Prince = Position 5

12. **Blend and Water**:
    - Blend must be on the left or right of Water.
    - Blend cannot be Position 1 (Norwegian), Position 2 (Green/Coffee/Danish/Tea), Position 3 (Milk), or Position 4 (Yellow/Dunhill/Swedish/Dog).
    - Therefore, Blend = Position 5
    - Water must be Position 4 (since it is next to Blend).

13. **Cat and Blend**:
    - Cat must be on the left or right of Blend.
    - Cat cannot be Position 1 (Norwegian), Position 2 (Green/Coffee/Danish/Tea), Position 3 (Milk), or Position 4 (Yellow/Dunhill/Swedish/Dog).
    - Therefore, Cat = Position 5

### Final Solution:
- **Position 1**: Norwegian, Blue, Water, Blend, Cat
- **Position 2**: Danish, Green, Coffee, Pall-Mall, Bird
- **Position 3**: Milk
- **Position 4**: Swedish, Yellow, Tea, Dunhill, Dog
