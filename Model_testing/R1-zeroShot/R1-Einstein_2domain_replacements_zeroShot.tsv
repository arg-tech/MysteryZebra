R1-Einstein-2domain-1	"Okay, let's try to solve this logic puzzle. It's one of those grid puzzles where you have to match different categories like color, nationality, food, house, and cigar across five positions. There are 15 clues, so I need to go through them step by step.

First, I'll list out all the categories and possible values to keep track:

Colors: blue, green, red, white, yellow

Nationalities: British, Danish, German, Norwegian, Swede

Houses: cottage, townhouse, palace, tower, modern

Cigars: Bluemaster, Dunhill, Pall Mall, Prince, Blend

Foods: lemon, onion, strawberry, lime, eggplant

Positions are 1 to 5 from left to right.

Let's start with the clues one by one.

Clue 9: The Norwegian is on the far left. So position 1 nationality is Norwegian.

Clue 8: The palace house is in the middle. Position 3 house is palace.

Clue 14: The Norwegian is adjacent to the person who likes blue. Since Norwegian is position 1, position 2 must be blue (since they can't be on the left of position 1). So color for position 2 is blue.

Clue 4: The person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white. So green is somewhere to the left of white. Also, clue 5 says the person who likes green is in the townhouse. So townhouse is green.

Clue 5: Green is townhouse. So house type for green is townhouse.

Clue 4: Green is left of white. Let's see possible positions. If green is in position 3, then white would be 4. But position 3 is palace, and clue 5 says green's house is townhouse, so position 3 can't be green. Therefore, maybe green is in position 2, but position 2's color is blue from clue 14. So that can't be. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check.

Clue 14: Norwegian (position 1) is adjacent to blue. So position 2 is blue. Then clue 4: green is left of white. So possible positions for green could be 3 and white 4, but since position 3 is palace, which is a different house type (palace vs townhouse). Wait, clue 5 says the person who likes green is in townhouse. So the green color must be in a townhouse, which is one of the house types. The palace is in position 3, so townhouse must be in another position. Let's try to figure out where green and white are.

Possible positions for green and white: Since green is left of white, and there are 5 positions, possible pairs could be (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5). But we know position 2 is blue (from clue 14), so green can't be in position 2 if position 2 is blue. Similarly, position 1 is Norwegian, but their color isn't specified yet. Wait, position 1's color could be green, but then white would be in position 2. But position 2 is blue. That's a conflict. So green can't be in position 1. So possible green positions could be 3,4, but since green must be left of white, let's see.

If green is position 3, white is 4. Then position 3's house is palace (from clue 8), but clue 5 says green is townhouse. So position 3 can't be green. Therefore, green must be in position 4, but that would require white to be 5, but then green is left of white. Wait, position 4 is left of 5, so that's okay. But clue 5 says green is townhouse. So the house in position 4 would be townhouse. But palace is in position 3. Let me check if that's possible. The house types are cottage, townhouse, palace, tower, modern. So if position 4 is townhouse (green), then position 5 would be white. But then clue 4 is satisfied. Let me note that.

But wait, maybe another possibility. Let me try to track the houses.

Clue 5: green is townhouse. Clue 8: palace is position 3. Clue 12: Bluemaster smoker is cottage. Clue 3: Danish is tower. Clue 15: Blend smoker is adjacent to modern house.

Clue 3: Danish is tower. So nationality Danish is in tower house. So tower is one of the houses. So the houses are: cottage (Bluemaster), tower (Danish), palace (position 3), townhouse (green), and modern.

So houses: position 3 is palace. Let's assign the others. Tower is one of the positions. Let's see.

Clue 12: Bluemaster smoker is cottage. So someone smokes Bluemaster and lives in cottage.

Clue 13: German is Prince smoker. So German's cigar is Prince.

Clue 7: Yellow is Dunhill smoker. So color yellow's cigar is Dunhill.

Clue 6: Pall Mall smoker eats onion. So Pall Mall = onion.

Clue 2: Swedish eats strawberry. So nationality Swede's food is strawberry.

Clue 1: British likes red. So nationality British's color is red.

Clue 10: Blend smoker is adjacent to lemon eater.

Clue 11: Eggplant eater is adjacent to Dunhill smoker.

Clue 15: Blend smoker is adjacent to modern house.

Let's start putting known info into the table.

Position 1: Nationality Norwegian (clue 9). House? Not sure yet. Color? Maybe yellow or another. Since position 2 is blue (from clue 14), and clue 4 requires green left of white. Let me see.

From clue 14: Norwegian (position 1) is adjacent to blue (position 2). So position 1's color can't be blue. Possible colors for position 1: yellow, green, red, white. But red is British's color (clue 1). Since British is a different nationality, position 1 is Norwegian, so color can't be red. So position 1's color could be yellow, green, or white. But if green is in townhouse (clue 5), and position 1 is Norwegian, let's check if position 1's color is yellow. Clue 7 says yellow is Dunhill smoker. So if position 1 is yellow, then their cigar is Dunhill. Let's tentatively assign that.

Position 1: Nationality Norwegian, color yellow, cigar Dunhill (from clue 7), house? Let's see. Houses: cottage, townhouse, palace, tower, modern. Position 3 is palace. Clue 3: Danish is tower. So tower is assigned to Danish's house. So let's check where tower is. If position 5 is tower? Not sure yet. Let's try to assign the houses.

Possible houses:

Position 1: ?

Position 2: ?

Position 3: palace

Position 4: ?

Position 5: ?

Clue 5: green is townhouse. So townhouse is in some position where color is green.

Clue 4: green is left of white. So green must be in position 1,2,3, or 4, and white in the next. But position 1's color could be yellow (from clue 7 if we assigned that). Position 2 is blue (clue 14). So green can't be in 1 (if 1 is yellow) or 2 (blue). So possible green positions: 3,4. But position 3's house is palace, which can't be townhouse. So green must be in position 4, house townhouse. Then white would be in position 5. So color for position 4: green, house townhouse; position 5: white.

Now, the colors are:

1: yellow

2: blue

3: ?

4: green

5: white

But the colors should be blue, green, red, white, yellow. So position 3 must be red. Because that's the remaining color. So position 3 is red.

Clue 1: British likes red. So position 3 nationality is British. So position 3: nationality British, color red, house palace.

Now, let's check nationalities:

1: Norwegian

3: British

Left nationalities: Danish, German, Swede.

Clue 2: Swede eats strawberry. So Swede's food is strawberry.

Clue 3: Danish is tower. So Danish's house is tower. Let's assign Danish to a position. The houses left are cottage, tower, modern. Position 1's house is yet to be determined. Let's see:

Houses assigned:

3: palace

4: townhouse (green)

5: ?

So remaining houses: cottage, tower, modern for positions 1, 2, 5.

Clue 12: Bluemaster smoker is cottage. So whoever smokes Bluemaster is in cottage.

Clue 15: Blend smoker is adjacent to modern house. So Blend is next to modern.

Clue 13: German is Prince smoker. So German's cigar is Prince.

Clue 7: position 1's cigar is Dunhill (if color yellow). So position 1: cigar Dunhill.

Clue 6: Pall Mall smoker eats onion. So Pall Mall = onion.

Clue 10: Blend smoker adjacent to lemon.

Clue 11: eggplant adjacent to Dunhill. Position 1 smokes Dunhill, so eggplant eater must be in position 2.

Clue 11: The person eating eggplants is adjacent to Dunhill smoker (position 1). So position 2's food is eggplant. But wait, position 1's neighbor is position 2. So position 2's food is eggplant. But let's check possible foods: lemon, onion, strawberry, lime, eggplant.

So position 2's food: eggplant.

But position 3 is British. Clue 1: British is red. Position 3's food? Not sure yet. Clue 2: Swede eats strawberry. So Swede's position has strawberry. Let's see where Swede can be. Nationalities left: Danish, German, Swede. Position 5's nationality? If position 5 is Swede, then food is strawberry. Let's try that.

Position 5: nationality Swede, food strawberry. That fits clue 2. Then position 5's house? The houses left are tower, modern, cottage. But clue 3 says Danish is tower. So Danish must be in tower. Let's assign Danish to position 2, 4, or 5. Position 4's house is townhouse (green), so not tower. Position 5's house could be tower? Let's see. If position 5 is Swede, their house can't be tower (since Danish is tower). So tower must be in another position. Let's see:

Houses remaining for positions 1,2,5: cottage, tower, modern.

Clue 12: cottage is Bluemaster. So position with cottage must have Bluemaster cigar.

Clue 3: Danish is tower. So Danish's house is tower, so nationality Danish is in tower house. So let's find where tower is. If position 2 is tower, then nationality Danish is in position 2. Then position 2's nationality is Danish, house tower. Let's check.

Position 2: nationality Danish, house tower. Then:

House assignments:

1: ?

2: tower (Danish)

3: palace (British)

4: townhouse (green)

5: ?

Houses left: cottage, modern. So position 1 and 5. Clue 12: Bluemaster is cottage. So cottage could be position 1 or 5. If position 1's house is cottage, then their cigar would be Bluemaster. But position 1's cigar is Dunhill. So that's a conflict. Therefore, cottage must be position 5. Then position 5's house is cottage, and cigar Bluemaster. But position 5's nationality is Swede, food strawberry. So Swede in cottage, smoking Bluemaster. Clue 12 is satisfied.

So position 5: house cottage, cigar Bluemaster. But wait, position 5's house is cottage? But clue 12 says Bluemaster is cottage. So yes, that works. So position 5: house cottage, cigar Bluemaster, nationality Swede, food strawberry, color white.

Then position 5's house is cottage. Then the remaining house for position 1 is modern. So position 1's house is modern. Let's check:

Houses:

1: modern

2: tower (Danish)

3: palace (British)

4: townhouse (green)

5: cottage (Swede)

That covers all houses: modern, tower, palace, townhouse, cottage.

Now, nationalities:

1: Norwegian

2: Danish

3: British

5: Swede

So remaining nationality is German in position 4.

Position 4: nationality German. Clue 13: German smokes Prince. So position 4's cigar is Prince.

Now, cigars:

1: Dunhill

4: Prince

5: Bluemaster

Left cigars: Pall Mall, Blend.

Clue 6: Pall Mall smoker eats onion. So Pall Mall = onion.

So who is left? Position 2 and 3. Position 3's food? Let's check.

Position 3's food: not strawberry (Swede), not eggplant (position 2), not onion (if Pall Mall is in another position). Let's see. The foods are lemon, onion, strawberry (position 5), lime, eggplant (position 2). So position 3's food could be lemon, onion, or lime.

If Pall Mall is in position 3, then food is onion. Let's check.

Position 3: cigar Pall Mall, food onion. Then clue 6 is satisfied. Then position 3's cigar is Pall Mall. Then remaining cigars are Blend for position 2.

So position 2's cigar is Blend. Then clue 10: Blend smoker is adjacent to lemon. Position 2's neighbor is position 1 and 3. Position 1's food is ?, position 3's food is onion. So if position 2's food is eggplant, then the lemon eater must be adjacent to Blend (position 2). So either position 1 or 3. Position 3's food is onion, so position 1 must have lemon. Let's check:

Position 1's food: lemon. Then, foods assigned:

1: lemon

2: eggplant

3: onion

5: strawberry

Remaining food: lime. So position 4's food is lime.

But wait, position 4's nationality is German. Let's check clue 10: Blend-smoker (position 2) is adjacent to lemon (position 1). That works. Clue 10 is satisfied.

Clue 11: eggplant (position 2) is adjacent to Dunhill (position 1). Yes, that's satisfied.

Clue 15: Blend-smoker (position 2) is adjacent to modern house (position 1). Yes, position 1's house is modern. So that works.

Now, let's fill in the remaining details.

Position 4: food lime? But wait, the foods are lemon, onion, strawberry, lime, eggplant. Position 4's food is the remaining one, which is lime. But let me check:

Position 1: lemon

2: eggplant

3: onion

5: strawberry

So yes, position 4's food is lime.

Now, let's check all clues:

1. British (position 3) likes red. Yes, position 3's color is red.

2. Swedish (position 5) eats strawberry. Correct.

3. Danish (position 2) is in tower. Yes, house tower.

4. Green (position 4) is left of white (position 5). Yes.

5. Green (position 4) is townhouse. Correct.

6. Pall Mall smoker (position 3) eats onion. Yes.

7. Yellow (position 1) is Dunhill smoker. Yes.

8. Palace (position 3) is middle. Yes.

9. Norwegian (position 1) far left. Correct.

10. Blend (position 2) adjacent to lemon (position 1). Yes.

11. Eggplant (position 2) adjacent to Dunhill (position 1). Yes.

12. Bluemaster (position 5) is cottage. Correct.

13. German (position 4) is Prince smoker. Yes.

14. Norwegian (position 1) adjacent to blue (position 2). Yes.

15. Blend (position 2) adjacent to modern (position 1). Yes.

Everything seems to fit. Let me check if all categories are filled without duplicates.

Colors: 1-yellow, 2-blue, 3-red, 4-green, 5-white. All unique.

Nationalities: 1-Norwegian, 2-Danish, 3-British, 4-German, 5-Swede. All unique.

Houses: 1-modern, 2-tower, 3-palace, 4-townhouse, 5-cottage. All unique.

Cigars: 1-Dunhill, 2-Blend, 3-Pall Mall, 4-Prince, 5-Bluemaster. All unique.

Foods: 1-lemon, 2-eggplant, 3-onion, 4-lime, 5-strawberry. Wait, lime is in position 4, which is German. But the food list given includes lemon, onion, strawberry, lime, eggplant. Yes, all covered.

Looks like everything checks out!

Okay, let's try to solve this logic puzzle. Hmm, there are five categories: color, sport, birthday, beverage, and cigar, each with five different options. The positions are numbered 1 to 5. I need to fill out the table based on the 15 clues provided.

First, I should list all the clues again to have them handy:

1. Tennis is red.

2. Snowboarding is January.

3. Skateboarding drinks tea.

4. Green is immediately left of white.

5. Green drinks coffee.

6. Pall-Mall smoker's birthday is April.

7. Yellow smokes Dunhill.

8. Milk is in the middle (position 3).

9. Parkour is on the far left (position 1).

10. Blend smoker is adjacent to February birthday.

11. November birthday is adjacent to Dunhill smoker.

12. Bluemaster drinks beer.

13. Soccer smokes Prince.

14. Parkour is adjacent to blue.

15. Blend is adjacent to water.

Alright, starting with the clues that give fixed positions. Clue 8 says milk is in position 3. Clue 9 says parkour is in position 1. So sport in position 1 is parkour.

Clue 14 says parkour (position 1) is adjacent to blue. Since parkour is in 1, blue must be in position 2. So color for position 2 is blue.

From clue 4: Green is immediately left of white. So if green is in position n, white is n+1. Since positions are 1-5, possible pairs are (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5). But position 2 is blue, so green can't be in 1 or 2 (since 2 is blue). Wait, no, clue 4 says green is left of white, but position 2 is blue. So green can't be in 2. So green and white must be in positions 3 and 4 or 4 and 5? Wait, position 2 is blue. Let's see. If green is in 3, white is 4. Or green in 4, white in 5. Let's hold that thought.

Clue 5: Green drinks coffee. So wherever green is, that person drinks coffee. Also, from clue 3, skateboarding drinks tea. Clue 1: tennis is red. Clue 2: snowboarding is January. Clue 6: Pall-Mall smoker's birthday is April. Clue 7: yellow smokes Dunhill. Clue 10: Blend is adjacent to February. Clue 11: November is adjacent to Dunhill. Clue 12: Bluemaster drinks beer. Clue 13: Soccer smokes Prince. Clue 15: Blend adjacent to water.

Let me try to map this step by step.

First, position 1: sport is parkour. From clue 14, adjacent to blue. Since position 1 is parkour, adjacent (position 2) is blue. So color 2 is blue. So color 1 must be something else. Wait, color in position 2 is blue, so color 1 is not blue.

Now, from clue 4 and 5: green must be left of white, and green drinks coffee. Let's see where green can be. Position 1 can't be green because position 2 is blue. So possible green positions: 3 or 4. If green is in 3, white is 4. Then coffee is in 3, and tea is skateboarding (clue 3). But position 3's beverage is milk (clue 8). Wait, position 3's beverage is milk. So that can't be coffee. So green can't be in position 3 because that would require coffee in position 3, but position 3 is milk. Therefore, green must be in position 4, and white in 5. Then coffee is in position 4. That works because position 4's beverage would be coffee, which is possible since position 3 is milk.

So colors:

1: ?

2: blue

3: ?

4: green

5: white

And green is 4, white 5. Then position 4 drinks coffee (clue 5). So beverage 4: coffee.

Beverage 3 is milk. Beverage 4: coffee. Then remaining beverages: beer, tea, water. From clue 3: skateboarding drinks tea. So wherever skateboarding is, that's tea.

Now, let's think about sports. We know position 1: parkour. Position 1's sport is parkour. Then the other sports are tennis, skateboarding, soccer, snowboarding. Let's see.

Clue 1: tennis is red. So the person who likes red plays tennis. So color red must be in the same position as tennis.

Clue 2: snowboarding is January. So the snowboarder's birthday is January.

Clue 13: soccer smokes Prince. So soccer's cigar is Prince.

Clue 7: yellow smokes Dunhill. So color yellow's cigar is Dunhill.

Clue 6: Pall-Mall's birthday is April. So whoever smokes Pall-Mall has birthday in April.

Clue 12: Bluemaster drinks beer. So Bluemaster smoker's beverage is beer.

Clue 10: Blend is adjacent to February birthday.

Clue 11: November birthday is adjacent to Dunhill smoker.

Clue 15: Blend smoker is adjacent to water drinker.

Let me try to assign colors. So colors left are red and yellow. Since positions 1,3,4,5 are assigned as:

1: ?

2: blue

3: ?

4: green

5: white

So remaining colors for positions 1 and 3 are red, yellow, and... wait, the colors are blue, green, red, white, yellow. So position 1 and 3 need to be red, yellow. Wait, position 2 is blue, 4 is green, 5 white. So remaining colors are red and yellow for positions 1 and 3.

From clue 1: tennis is red. So the person who plays tennis likes red. So if position 1 is parkour (sport), then tennis must be in another position. Let's see. Let's suppose position x plays tennis and has color red.

Possible positions for tennis: 2,3,4,5. But position 4 is green, 5 is white. So red can't be in 4 or 5. So red must be in 1 or 3. But position 1's color is either red or yellow.

Wait, position 1's color is either red or yellow. If red is in position 1, then the sport there is parkour. But clue 1 says tennis is red. So that can't be. Therefore, red must be in position 3. Because position 3's color would be red, and then the sport there is tennis. Because clue 1 says tennis is red.

So color position 3: red. Sport position 3: tennis.

Therefore, color 1 must be yellow. So:

1: yellow

2: blue

3: red

4: green

5: white

Now, color 1 is yellow. From clue 7: yellow smokes Dunhill. So cigar 1: Dunhill.

So cigar assignments:

1: Dunhill

Others: bluemaster, pall-mall, prince, blend.

Now, let's look at clue 11: November birthday is adjacent to Dunhill smoker. Since Dunhill is in position 1, November must be in position 2. Because position 1's neighbors are 2. So birthday for position 2 is November. Wait, the birthdays are february, april, january, june, november. So birthday 2: november. But clue 2 says snowboarding is january. So the person who does snowboarding has birthday in january.

Now, sport assignments: parkour (1), tennis (3), skateboarding, soccer, snowboarding. Let's see.

Clue 3: skateboarding drinks tea. So wherever skateboarding is, that's tea.

Clue 2: snowboarding is january. So snowboarding's birthday is january. Let's see, birthdays assigned so far: position 2 is november, position 3 is red (sport tennis). Position 1's birthday? Let's see.

Available birthdays: february, april, january, june. Position 2: november. So remaining birthdays for positions 1,3,4,5: feb, apr, jan, jun.

Clue 6: pall-mall smoker has birthday april. So someone smokes pall-mall and birthday is april.

Clue 10: blend smoker is adjacent to february. So if someone's birthday is feb, then blend is next to them.

Clue 15: blend is adjacent to water. So blend smoker is next to someone who drinks water.

Now, let's check sports. We have sports in positions 1: parkour, 3: tennis. So remaining sports: skateboarding, soccer, snowboarding for positions 2,4,5.

Clue 2: snowboarding is january. So whoever has birthday january does snowboarding. So find where january is.

Possible birthday months: positions 1,3,4,5.

If position 2 is november, then we need to assign feb, apr, jan, jun to 1,3,4,5.

Let me try to assign snowboarding (january) to a position. Let's see.

If snowboarding is in position 5, then birthday 5 is january. But position 5's color is white. But clue 2 says snowboarding is january. So sport 5 would be snowboarding, birthday 5 is january.

Alternatively, snowboarding could be in position 4, birthday 4 is january. Let's see.

But let's see other clues. From clue 6: pall-mall smoker's birthday is april. So someone's birthday is april, and they smoke pall-mall.

Clue 12: bluemaster smoker drinks beer. So beer is in the same position as bluemaster.

Clue 13: soccer smokes prince. So soccer's cigar is prince.

Clue 7: yellow (position1) smokes dunhill.

Clue 10: blend is adjacent to february.

Clue 11: november (position2) is adjacent to dunhill (position1). That's already true because position2 is adjacent to position1. So that clue is satisfied.

Now, let's look at beverages. Position3 drinks milk. Position4 drinks coffee. The remaining beverages are beer, tea, water. Positions1,2,5 need these.

Clue 3: skateboarding drinks tea. So wherever skateboarding is, tea is there.

Clue 12: bluemaster drinks beer. So wherever bluemaster is, beer is there.

Clue 15: blend is adjacent to water. So if someone drinks water, blend smoker is next to them.

Let's try to assign sports. Positions 2,4,5 have sports skateboarding, soccer, snowboarding.

Let's suppose position5's sport is snowboarding (since it's in january). Then birthday5 is january. Then position5's birthday is january.

Then remaining birthdays: positions1,3,4 have feb, apr, jun.

Clue6: pall-mall is april. So someone's birthday is april, and smokes pall-mall.

Let's suppose position4's birthday is april. Then cigar4 is pall-mall. Sport4 is either soccer or skateboarding.

If sport4 is soccer, then from clue13, soccer smokes prince. So cigar4 would be prince. But that conflicts because if birthday4 is april, then cigar4 should be pall-mall. Therefore, sport4 can't be soccer. Therefore, sport4 must be skateboarding. Then skateboarding is in position4, which drinks tea (clue3). So beverage4 is tea. But beverage4 is coffee from earlier. Wait, contradiction. Wait, no: beverage4 is coffee (from clue5: green drinks coffee, position4 is green). So skateboarding can't be in position4. So that's a problem.

Wait, maybe my assumption is wrong. Let's backtrack. If snowboarding is in position5 (birthday january), then position5's sport is snowboarding, birthday5 is january.

Now, positions2,4: sports skateboarding and soccer.

Clue3: skateboarding drinks tea. So if skateboarding is in position2, then beverage2 is tea. If skateboarding is in position4, beverage4 is tea. But beverage4 is coffee (from clue5: green drinks coffee). So skateboarding can't be in position4. Therefore, skateboarding must be in position2. Then beverage2 is tea.

So sport2: skateboarding, beverage2: tea.

Then sport4 and 5 are soccer and snowboarding. Sport5 is snowboarding (january), so sport4 is soccer. Then soccer is in position4. From clue13, soccer smokes prince. So cigar4: prince.

Now, cigar4 is prince. So cigars assigned so far:

1: dunhill

4: prince

Remaining: bluemaster, pall-mall, blend.

Clue6: pall-mall smoker's birthday is april. So whoever smokes pall-mall has birthday april.

Let's see birthdays:

Position1: ?

Position2: november

Position3: ?

Position4: ?

Position5: january

Remaining birthdays: feb, apr, jun.

If position4's birthday is april, then cigar4 is prince, but clue6 says pall-mall is april. So that's a conflict. Therefore, position4's birthday can't be april. Therefore, pall-mall must be in a different position. Let's see.

If pall-mall is in position3, then birthday3 is april. But position3's sport is tennis, color red. Let's check.

If cigar3 is pall-mall, then birthday3 is april. Then birthday3 is april.

Then remaining birthdays for positions1 and 4: feb and jun.

Clue10: blend is adjacent to february. So if someone has february birthday, blend is next to them.

Clue15: blend is adjacent to water.

So let's assign birthdays.

Suppose position1's birthday is february. Then, from clue10, blend smoker is adjacent to february (position1). So blend would be in position2. Then cigar2: blend.

Then from clue15: blend (position2) is adjacent to water. So water must be in position1 or 3. Position1's beverage is not yet assigned. Beverages left: beer, water, and... position2: tea, position3: milk, position4: coffee. So remaining beverages for 1,5: beer and water. If blend (position2) is adjacent to water, then water must be in position1 or 3. But position3 has milk, so water must be in position1. So beverage1: water. Then position5's beverage would be beer. But clue12 says bluemaster smoker drinks beer. So position5's cigar would be bluemaster.

But let's check:

If position1: birthday feb, beverage water.

Cigar1: dunhill.

Cigar2: blend.

Cigar3: ?

Cigar4: prince.

Cigar5: ?

Remaining cigars: bluemaster, pall-mall.

From clue6: pall-mall smoker has birthday april. So if position3 is pall-mall, birthday3 is april. Then position3's birthday is april. That leaves position4's birthday as jun (since remaining are jun and position4's birthday is not assigned yet).

But let's check:

Birthdays:

1: feb

2: nov

3: apr

4: jun

5: jan

Then position3: birthday april, cigar pall-mall. That fits clue6.

Then cigar5 would be bluemaster (since remaining), and beverage5 is beer (clue12). So beverage5: beer.

Then beverage1: water, beverage5: beer. That leaves position5's beverage as beer, which matches bluemaster (cigar5: bluemaster). So that works.

Now, let's check the remaining cigars. So:

Cigar1: dunhill

Cigar2: blend

Cigar3: pall-mall

Cigar4: prince

Cigar5: bluemaster

Now, check clue12: bluemaster drinks beer (position5's beverage is beer, correct).

Clue15: blend (position2) is adjacent to water (position1), yes.

Now, birthdays:

1: feb

2: nov

3: apr

4: jun

5: jan

Check clue10: blend (position2) is adjacent to feb (position1). Yes.

Clue11: november (position2) is adjacent to dunhill (position1). Yes.

Position4: coffee

Position5: beer

Cigars:

5: january

Wait, but position4's birthday is june? Let's check the clues. The birthdays are feb, apr, jan, jun, nov. Yes, that's covered.

Clue6: pall-mall (position3) has birthday april. Yes.

Clue10: blend (position2) is adjacent to feb (position1). Yes.

Clue15: blend (position2) is adjacent to water (position1). Yes.

Clue12: bluemaster (position5) drinks beer. Yes.

To solve this logic puzzle, we will systematically apply the given clues to fill in the table. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

---

### Step 1: Initialize the table
We have 5 positions (1 to 5) and 5 categories: color, nationality, sport, beverage, and city. We start by noting the clues and filling in the information step by step.

---

### Step 2: Apply direct clues
1. **Clue 9**: The Norwegian is on the far left (Position 1).
   - Nationality at Position 1: Norwegian.

2. **Clue 8**: The person drinking milk is in the middle (Position 3).
   - Beverage at Position 3: Milk.

3. **Clue 3**: The Danish is the person drinking tea.
   - Nationality: Danish → Beverage: Tea.

4. **Clue 13**: The German is the person traveling to Liverpool.
   - Nationality: German → City: Liverpool.

5. **Clue 12**: The person traveling to New York is the person drinking beer.
   - City: New York → Beverage: Beer.

6. **Clue 7**: The person who likes yellow is the person traveling to Edinburgh.
   - Color: Yellow → City: Edinburgh.

7. **Clue 2**: The Swedish is the person whose sport is cricket.
   - Nationality: Swedish → Sport: Cricket.

8. **Clue 1**: The British is the person who likes red.
   - Nationality: British → Color: Red.

9. **Clue 5**: The person who likes green is the person drinking coffee.
   - Color: Green → Beverage: Coffee.

    - Norwegian (Position 1) is adjacent to blue.

15. **Clue 15**: The person traveling to London is on the left or right of the person drinking water.
    - London is adjacent to water.

### Step 3: Fill in the table step by step
Using the above clues, we deduce the following:

1. **Position 1**:
   - Nationality: Norwegian.
   - From Clue 14, the person next to the Norwegian likes blue. So Position 2: Color: Blue.

2. **Position 2**:
   - Color: Blue.
   - From Clue 4, green is to the left of white. Since Position 2 is blue, green and white must be in Positions 3 and 4 or 4 and 5.

3. **Position 3**:
   - Beverage: Milk (from Clue 8).
   - From Clue 5, green is associated with coffee. Since Position 3 has milk, green cannot be here. So green must be in Position 4, and white in Position 5.

4. **Position 4**:
   - Color: Green.
   - Beverage: Coffee (from Clue 5).

5. **Position 5**:
   - Color: White.

6. **From Clue 7**, the person who likes yellow is traveling to Edinburgh. Yellow must be in Position 2 (blue is already in Position 2), so this is a contradiction. Re-evaluate:
   - Position 2: Color: Blue.
   - Position 3: Color: Red (from Clue 1, British likes red).
   - Position 4: Color: Green.
   - Position 5: Color: White.
   - Thus, yellow must be in Position 1.

7. **Position 1**:
   - Color: Yellow.
   - City: Edinburgh (from Clue 7).

8. **Position 2**:
   - Color: Blue.
   - From Clue 14, Norwegian (Position 1) is adjacent to blue (Position 2).

9. **Position 3**:
   - Color: Red.
   - Nationality: British (from Clue 1).
   - Beverage: Milk.

10. **Position 4**:
    - Color: Green.
    - Beverage: Coffee.

11. **Position 5**:
    - Color: White.

12. **From Clue 12**, the person traveling to New York drinks beer. Assign this to Position 2:
    - City: New York.
    - Beverage: Beer.

13. **From Clue 13**, the German is traveling to Liverpool. Assign this to Position 4:
    - Nationality: German.
    - City: Liverpool.

14. **From Clue 2**, the Swedish person plays cricket. Assign this to Position 5:
    - Nationality: Swedish.
    - Sport: Cricket.

15. **From Clue 6**, the person traveling to Venice plays climbing. Assign this to Position 3:
    - City: Venice.
    - Sport: Climbing.

16. **From Clue 10**, the person traveling to London is adjacent to lacrosse. Assign London to Position 4:
    - City: London.
    - Sport: Lacrosse (Position 3 or 5). Position 5 is cricket, so Position 3: Sport: Climbing (already assigned). Contradiction. Re-evaluate:
    - London must be in Position 4, adjacent to lacrosse in Position 5.

17. **From Clue 11**, skateboarding is adjacent to Edinburgh (Position 1). Assign skateboarding to Position 2:
    - Sport: Skateboarding.

18. **From Clue 15**, London is adjacent to water. Assign water to Position 5:
    - Beverage: Water.

19. **From Clue 3**, the Danish drinks tea. Assign this to Position 2:
    - Nationality: Danish.
    - Beverage: Tea.

20. **From Clue 12**, the person traveling to New York drinks beer. Assign this to Position 2:
    - City: New York.
    - Beverage: Beer.
