R1-Zebra-3domain-1	"Okay, let's try to solve this logic puzzle. It's a classic grid puzzle where we have five columns (1 to 5) representing different people, each with attributes like nationality, transport, beverage, music genre, and hobby. The goal is to fill in the table based on the given clues.

First, I'll list all the clues again to make sure I don't miss any:

1. The English person drives the motorbike.

2. The Spanish person's hobby is singing.

3. The person drinking coffee drives the bus.

4. The Ukrainian drinks tea.

5. The person driving the bus is to the right of the person driving the ship.

6. The hip-hop fan's hobby is writing.

7. The quad-bikes music genre fan drives the subway.

8. The person drinking milk is in the middle (position 3).

9. The Norwegian is on the far left (position 1).

10. The trance fan is adjacent to the person whose hobby is photography.

11. The quad-bikes music fan is adjacent to the person whose hobby is fishing.

12. The d&b fan drinks orange juice.

13. The Japanese person is a rock fan.

14. The Norwegian is adjacent to the person driving the quad-bike.

Alright, let's start by filling in the information we know for certain.

From clue 9: Norwegian is in position 1. So nationality column 1 is Norwegian.

Clue 8: Milk is in position 3. So beverage column 3 is milk.

Clue 5: Bus is to the right of ship. So if the ship is in position X, the bus is in X+1. Since positions are 1-5, possible pairs are (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5). But we'll have to check other clues to see where these fit.

Clue 14: Norwegian (position 1) is adjacent to quad-bike driver. So quad-bike must be in position 2. Because position 1 is Norwegian, quad-bike is transport in 2. So transport column 2 is quad-bike. Wait, but the transports are motorbike, bus, ship, subway, quad-bike. So quad-bike is one of them. So position 2's transport is quad-bike. But let's check other clues. Wait, clue 7 says the fan of quad-bikes (music genre) drives the subway. Wait, quad-bikes is a music genre? Wait, looking back at the initial lists: music genres are hip-hop, quad-bikes, trance, d&b, rock. Wait, that seems odd. Quad-bikes as a music genre? Maybe that's a typo, but assuming the puzzle is correct, the music genres include quad-bikes. So clue 7: the fan of quad-bikes (music) drives the subway. So the person who likes quad-bikes (music) has transport subway. So subway is their transport. So that's a connection between music genre quad-bikes and transport subway.

But back to clue 14: Norwegian (position 1) is adjacent to quad-bike (transport). So transport in position 2 is quad-bike. But quad-bike is a transport. Wait, the transports are motorbike, bus, ship, subway, quad-bike. So quad-bike is a transport, yes. So if Norwegian is in 1, then transport in 2 is quad-bike. But wait, that would make the person in 2 driving a quad-bike. Then clue 14 is satisfied. So transport column 2 is quad-bike. But let's check if that conflicts with other clues.

Wait, clue 1: English drives motorbike. So motorbike is transport for English. Let's note that. So wherever English is, their transport is motorbike.

Clue 3: Coffee drinker drives bus. So wherever coffee is, that person's transport is bus.

Clue 4: Ukrainian drinks tea. So Ukrainian's beverage is tea.

Clue 5: Bus is to the right of ship. So ship must be in a position left of bus.

Clue 6: Hip-hop fan's hobby is writing. So music genre hip-hop implies hobby writing.

Clue 7: Quad-bikes (music genre) fan drives subway. So subway transport is linked to quad-bikes music.

Clue 12: d&b fan drinks orange juice. So music d&b → beverage OJ.

Clue 13: Japanese is rock fan. So Japanese nationality → music rock.

Clue 10: Trance fan is adjacent to photography hobby.

Clue 11: Quad-bikes (music) fan is adjacent to fishing hobby.

Okay, starting with the known positions:

Nationality: 1 is Norwegian.

Beverage: 3 is milk.

Transport: 2 is quad-bike (from clue 14). Wait, but let's confirm that. Clue 14 says Norwegian (position 1) is adjacent to quad-bike driver. So quad-bike driver is either position 2 or position 0 (which doesn't exist). So must be position 2. So transport 2 is quad-bike. That's a deduction.

Now, transports used so far: quad-bike (position 2). Remaining transports: motorbike, bus, ship, subway.

Clue 1: English drives motorbike. So we need to find where English is. Nationality English is in some position where transport is motorbike.

Clue 3: Coffee drinker is bus driver. So wherever bus is, that person drinks coffee.

Clue 5: Bus is to the right of ship. So ship must be left of bus.

Let's try to figure out positions of ship and bus. Let's list possible positions.

If bus is in 3, then ship must be in 2. But position 2's transport is quad-bike, so that can't be. So ship can't be in 2. If bus is in 4, ship is in 3. If bus is in 5, ship is in 4.

But let's check other constraints. Also, clue 3 says the coffee drinker is in the bus. So wherever the bus is, that person drinks coffee.

Let's consider possible bus positions.

If bus is in 3: But position 3's beverage is milk (clue 8). So that's a conflict. So bus can't be in 3.

If bus is in 4: Then ship is in 3. Transport 3 is ship. Then, the person in 4 drinks coffee (clue 3). But let's see if that works.

If bus is in 4, ship in 3. Then transports: 1: ?, 2: quad-bike, 3: ship, 4: bus, 5: subway? Because remaining transports are motorbike, bus, ship, subway, but we already have quad-bike, ship, bus. So remaining are motorbike and subway. So 1 and 5 would need to be motorbike and subway.

Clue 1: English drives motorbike. So if motorbike is in 1, then nationality 1 is English. But nationality 1 is Norwegian (clue 9). Conflict. So motorbike can't be in 1. So motorbike must be in 5, subway in 1? Wait, but position 1's transport isn't known yet. Let's see.

Wait, transports:

Positions:

1: ?

2: quad-bike

3: ship (if bus is in 4)

4: bus

5: ?

But remaining transports are motorbike and subway. So positions 1 and 5 need those. If motorbike is in 1, nationality 1 is English. But position 1 is Norwegian. So that's impossible. Therefore, motorbike must be in 5, and subway in 1. But subway is a transport. So transport 1: subway? But clue 7 says that quad-bikes (music) fan drives subway. So subway driver is a fan of quad-bikes music. So if transport 1 is subway, then music genre 1 is quad-bikes. But let's see if that's possible.

But let's think again. Let's see:

If bus is in 4, ship in 3. Then transports:

1: subway

2: quad-bike

3: ship

4: bus

5: motorbike

Then, from clue 1: English drives motorbike, so English is in 5. Nationality 5: English. But wait, clue 13: Japanese is rock fan. So Japanese nationality must be in a position where music is rock. Also, clue 4: Ukrainian drinks tea. Let's see where tea is.

But let's proceed step by step.

If bus is in 4, then person 4 drinks coffee (clue 3). Beverage 4: coffee. Beverage 3: milk. So beverages so far: 3: milk, 4: coffee. Remaining beverages: tea, OJ, water.

Clue 4: Ukrainian drinks tea. So Ukrainian's beverage is tea. So we need to find where tea is.

Clue 12: d&b fan drinks OJ. So music d&b → OJ. So wherever OJ is, that person's music is d&b.

Clue 13: Japanese is rock. So Japanese nationality → music rock.

Clue 7: quad-bikes music fan drives subway. So subway driver (transport subway) has music quad-bikes. If transport 1 is subway, then music 1 is quad-bikes. But let's check if that's possible.

But in this scenario, transport 1 is subway, music 1 is quad-bikes. Then, from clue 11: quad-bikes music (position 1) is adjacent to fishing hobby. So position 2's hobby is fishing, or position 0, which is invalid. So hobby 2 must be fishing. But let's see if that's possible.

Also, from clue 2: Spanish's hobby is singing. So somewhere, Spanish nationality has hobby singing.

Let's try to assign nationalities. We have:

1: Norwegian

5: English (if motorbike is in 5, per clue 1)

But wait, in this scenario, transport 5 is motorbike, so nationality 5 must be English. So nationality 5: English. Then, remaining nationalities are Spanish, Ukrainian, Japanese. Positions 2,3,4.

Clue 4: Ukrainian drinks tea. So Ukrainian must be in a position where beverage is tea. Let's see possible positions for tea.

Beverages so far: 3: milk, 4: coffee. Remaining: 1,2,5: tea, OJ, water.

If Ukrainian is in position 2, then beverage 2 is tea. If in position 5, beverage 5 is tea. But let's see.

If Ukrainian is in position 2: nationality 2: Ukrainian, beverage 2: tea. Then, beverage 2 is tea. That leaves beverages 1 and 5 as OJ and water. But from clue 12: d&b music is OJ. So wherever OJ is, that person's music is d&b. Let's say beverage 5 is OJ, then music 5 is d&b. But nationality 5 is English, so music for English would be d&b. But clue 13 says Japanese is rock. So Japanese must be in another position.

Alternatively, if beverage 1 is OJ, then music 1 is d&b. But transport 1 is subway, music 1 is quad-bikes (from clue 7). Wait, conflict here. Because if transport 1 is subway, then music 1 is quad-bikes (clue 7). But if beverage 1 is OJ, then music 1 should be d&b (clue 12). Contradiction. So beverage 1 cannot be OJ. Therefore, OJ must be in position 5 or 2. Wait, position 2's beverage is tea (if Ukrainian is there). So OJ would be in 1 or 5. But position 1's beverage can't be OJ because that would require music 1 to be d&b, but music 1 is quad-bikes (from transport subway). Therefore, OJ must be in position 5. So beverage 5: OJ → music 5: d&b. But nationality 5 is English (from clue 1). So English person's music is d&b. Then, music 5: d&b. But we need to check if that's allowed. Clue 13: Japanese is rock. So rock must be in another position.

Let's try to outline:

Nationalities:

1: Norwegian

2: ?

3: ?

4: ?

5: English

Beverages:

1: ?

2: tea (if Ukrainian here)

3: milk

4: coffee

5: OJ

So beverage 2: tea → nationality 2: Ukrainian.

So nationality 2: Ukrainian.

Then, remaining nationalities for positions 3 and 4: Spanish and Japanese.

Clue 2: Spanish's hobby is singing. So Spanish must have hobby singing.

Clue 13: Japanese is rock. So Japanese nationality → music rock.

So let's assign position 3 and 4:

If position 4 is Spanish, then hobby 4 is singing. Then position 3 would be Japanese, music 3: rock. But beverage 3 is milk. Let's see.

Wait, music genres: positions 1: quad-bikes (from clue 7, transport 1 is subway → music quad-bikes), 2: ?, 3: rock (if Japanese here), 4: ?, 5: d&b (from beverage OJ). But music genres must be hip-hop, quad-bikes, trance, d&b, rock. So quad-bikes (1), d&b (5), rock (3). Remaining: hip-hop and trance for 2 and 4.

Clue 6: hip-hop fan's hobby is writing. So if position 2 or 4 has hip-hop, their hobby is writing.

Clue 10: trance fan is adjacent to photography. So trance must be next to photography.

Clue 11: quad-bikes music (position 1) is adjacent to fishing. So hobby 2 must be fishing (since position 1's music is quad-bikes, adjacent to position 2). So hobby 2: fishing.

But wait, from clue 11: quad-bikes music fan (position 1) is adjacent to fishing. So yes, hobby 2 is fishing.

So hobby 2: fishing.

Then, hobby 4: singing (if Spanish is in 4). Then remaining hobbies: positions 1,3,5: board-games, photography, writing. Hobbies are singing, photography, board-games, fishing, writing. So 2: fishing, 4: singing. Remaining: 1,3,5: photography, board-games, writing.

Clue 6: hip-hop fan's hobby is writing. So if someone's music is hip-hop, hobby is writing.

Clue 10: trance is adjacent to photography. Let's see.

Music genres assigned so far:

1: quad-bikes

2: ?

3: rock (if Japanese in 3)

4: ?

5: d&b

If Japanese is in 3, nationality 3: Japanese, music 3: rock.

Then, remaining music for 2 and 4: hip-hop and trance.

If position 2 is trance, then adjacent to photography (clue 10). So hobby in position 1 or 3 must be photography. But hobbies left are 1: ?, 3: ?, 5: ?. Let's see.

Alternatively, if position 4 is trance, then adjacent to photography (position 3 or 5). Let's see.

But let's first assign music. Let's assume position 2 is trance. Then, according to clue 10, trance (position 2) is adjacent to photography. So hobby 1 or 3 must be photography. But position 1's hobby is among photography, board-games, writing. Let's say hobby 1 is photography. Then, that satisfies clue 10. Then, remaining hobbies: 3 and 5 have board-games and writing. If position 4 is hip-hop (music), then hobby 4 is writing (clue 6). But position 4's hobby is singing (if Spanish is in 4). Wait, conflict here. Because if position 4 is Spanish, hobby is singing. So music 4 can't be hip-hop because that would require hobby 4 to be writing. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, if position 4's music is hip-hop, then hobby 4 must be writing. But position 4's hobby is singing (Spanish). Conflict. Therefore, position 4 cannot have hip-hop. Therefore, position 2 must be hip-hop, and position 4 trance.

Wait, let's try:

Music 2: hip-hop → hobby 2: writing (clue 6). But hobby 2 is already fishing (from clue 11). Conflict. So that's impossible. Therefore, position 2 cannot be hip-hop. Therefore, position 4 must be hip-hop. But position 4's hobby is singing (Spanish), which can't be writing. So this seems impossible. Therefore, our initial assumption that bus is in 4 might be wrong.

Let's backtrack. Maybe the bus is in 5, ship in 4. Let's consider that.

If bus is in 5, then ship is in 4. So transports:

1: ?

2: quad-bike (from clue 14)

3: ?

4: ship

5: bus

But beverage for bus (position 5) is coffee (clue 3). So beverage 5: coffee. But beverage 3 is milk (clue 8). Then, remaining beverages: 1,2,4: tea, OJ, water.

Clue 4: Ukrainian drinks tea. So Ukrainian must be in a position where beverage is tea. Let's see possible positions.

If position 2's beverage is tea, then Ukrainian is in 2. Nationality 2: Ukrainian.

Then, remaining beverages 1 and 4: OJ and water.

Clue 12: d&b drinks OJ. So OJ is in position 1 or 4. If OJ is in 4, then music 4 is d&b. If OJ in 1, music 1 is d&b.

But transports: position 1's transport is not yet assigned. Possible transports: motorbike, subway, ship. Wait, we have transports as:

1: ?

2: quad-bike

4: ship

5: bus

Remaining transports: motorbike and subway. So 1 and 3 must be motorbike and subway. Clue 1: English drives motorbike. So if motorbike is in 1, nationality 1 is English. But position 1 is Norwegian (clue 9). Conflict. Therefore, motorbike must be in 3, subway in 1. So transport 1: subway, 3: motorbike. Then, nationality for motorbike (position 3) is English (clue 1). So nationality 3: English. But position 5's nationality would then be? Nationalities: 1: Norwegian, 2: Ukrainian, 3: English. Remaining: Spanish, Japanese in positions 4 and 5.

Clue 13: Japanese is rock fan. So Japanese must have music rock. Let's assign nationality 5: Japanese. Then, position 4: Spanish. Because Spanish's hobby is singing (clue 2). So hobby 4: singing.

Now, let's check beverages:

1: ?

2: tea (Ukrainian)

3: ?

4: ?

5: coffee (from bus in 5)

But beverage 3 is milk (clue 8). So beverage 3: milk. So beverages:

1: ?

2: tea

3: milk

4: ?

5: coffee

Remaining beverages: OJ and water for 1 and 4.

Clue 12: d&b → OJ. So if position 4 has OJ, then music 4 is d&b. If position 1 has OJ, music 1 is d&b.

Transport 1: subway. Clue 7: quad-bikes music fan (music genre quad-bikes) drives subway. So music 1: quad-bikes. But if beverage 1 is OJ, then music 1 should be d&b (clue 12). Conflict. Therefore, OJ must be in position 4. Beverage 4: OJ → music 4: d&b. Then, beverage 1: water. So beverages:

1: water

2: tea

3: milk

4: OJ

5: coffee

Now, music genres:

1: quad-bikes (from clue 7, subway driver)

4: d&b (from OJ)

5: ? Remaining genres: hip-hop, trance, rock.

Clue 13: Japanese (position 5) is rock. So music 5: rock.

Then, remaining music genres for positions 2 and 3: hip-hop and trance.

Clue 6: hip-hop → hobby writing. Let's see where hip-hop could be.

Hobbies:

Position 1: ?

2: ?

3: ?

4: singing

5: ?

Hobbies available: photography, board-games, fishing, writing.

From clue 11: quad-bikes music (position 1) is adjacent to fishing. So hobby 2 must be fishing (since position 1 is next to 2). So hobby 2: fishing.

Then, remaining hobbies: 1,3,5: photography, board-games, writing.

Clue 10: trance is adjacent to photography. If position 3 has trance, then adjacent to position 2 (fishing) or 4 (singing). So no. If position 2 has trance, adjacent to position 1 (quad-bikes) and 3. But position 2's music is either hip-hop or trance.

If music 2 is trance, then adjacent to photography. So hobby 1 or 3 must be photography. Let's say hobby 1 is photography. Then, music 2: trance, hobby 1: photography. Then remaining hobbies 3 and 5: board-games and writing.

Clue 6: hip-hop fan's hobby is writing. If music 3 is hip-hop, then hobby 3 is writing. So music 3: hip-hop, hobby 3: writing. Then music 2 would have to be trance. Let's check:

Music assignments:

1: quad-bikes

2: trance

3: hip-hop

4: d&b

5: rock

Then hobbies:

1: photography

2: fishing

3: writing

4: singing

5: ?

Remaining hobby for 5: board-games.

Does that fit? Let's check clue 10: trance (position 2) is adjacent to photography (position 1). Yes, that works.

Clue 6: hip-hop (position 3) → hobby writing (position 3). Correct.

Clue 11: quad-bikes (position 1) adjacent to fishing (position 2). Yes.

R1-Zebra-3domain-2	"Okay, let's try to solve this logic puzzle. It looks like a classic grid puzzle where we need to match five categories across five people. The categories are transport, birthday month, city, cigar brand, and pet. Each person has a unique value in each category. There are 14 clues to help us fill out the table. Let me start by listing all the clues and then try to process them step by step.

First, the categories:

- Transport: quad-bike, ship, van, helicopter, skateboard

- Birthday: May, January, July, June, September

- City: Hannover, Berlin, Venice, Colone, Hamburg

- Cigar: Old-Gold, Kools, Chesterfields, Lucky-Strike, Parliaments

- Pet: Dog, Fox, Zebra, Horse, Snails

The positions are numbered 1 to 5 from left to right. So, position 1 is far left, 5 is far right.

Let's go through each clue and see what we can deduce.

1. The person driving the quad-bike is the person whose birthday is in May.

So Quad-bike → May.

2. The person driving the ship owns the dog.

Ship → Dog.

3. The person traveling to Hannover has a birthday in January.

Hannover → January.

4. The person driving the van is traveling to Berlin.

Van → Berlin.

5. The person whose birthday is in January is to the right of the person whose birthday is in July.

So July must be in a position left of January. Since positions are 1-5, if January is in position X, July is in X-1. But since January can't be in position 1 (because someone has to be to the left), January must be at least position 2, with July at position 1. Wait, no: the clue says January is to the right of July, so July is to the left. So January's position is higher (greater number) than July's.

6. The Old-Gold-smoker owns the snails.

Old-Gold → Snails.

7. The Kools-smoker has a birthday in June.

Kools → June.

8. The person traveling to Venice is in the middle. That's position 3.

Venice → Position 3.

9. The person driving the helicopter is on the far left. So position 1's transport is helicopter.

10. The Chesterfields-smoker is adjacent (left or right) to the owner of the fox.

11. The Kools-smoker is adjacent to the owner of the horse.

12. The Lucky-Strike-smoker is traveling to Colone.

Lucky-Strike → Colone.

13. The skateboard driver is the Parliaments-smoker.

Skateboard → Parliaments.

14. The person driving the helicopter is adjacent to the person whose birthday is in September.

Helicopter (position 1) is adjacent (position 2) to September birthday.

Let me start by noting the fixed positions first.

From clue 9: Position 1's transport is helicopter.

From clue 8: Position 3's city is Venice.

From clue 3: Hannover's birthday is January. So the person in Hannover has birthday January. Wait, Hannover is a city. So city Hannover corresponds to birthday January. So in the city row, wherever Hannover is, the birthday there is January.

Similarly, from clue 4: Van's city is Berlin. So wherever the van is in transport, the city is Berlin.

From clue 12: Lucky-Strike's city is Colone. So in the cigar row, wherever Lucky-Strike is, the city is Colone.

From clue 13: Skateboard transport corresponds to Parliaments cigar.

Clue 1: Quad-bike → May birthday.

Clue 2: Ship → Dog pet.

Clue 5: January's birthday is to the right of July's. So July < January in position.

Clue 6: Old-Gold cigar → Snails pet.

Clue 7: Kools → June birthday.

Clue 10: Chesterfields adjacent to Fox.

Clue 11: Kools adjacent to Horse.

Clue 14: Helicopter (position 1) is adjacent (position 2) to September birthday. So position 2's birthday is September.

Wait, but position 1's transport is helicopter. Clue 14 says helicopter is adjacent to September birthday. So the person next to helicopter (position 1) must have September. So either position 2 or position 0, but position 0 doesn't exist. So position 2 must have September birthday.

Therefore, birthday for position 2 is September.

Now, the birthdays are May, January, July, June, September.

We have position 2 as September. So remaining months: May, January, July, June. These must be in positions 1,3,4,5.

But clue 3 says the person traveling to Hannover (city) has birthday January. So the city Hannover is in a position, and that position's birthday is January. Let's see where Hannover is.

Also, clue 5 says January is to the right of July. So July is in a position less than January's position.

Since January is in the city Hannover's position, let's first try to find where Hannover is.

Cities are Hannover, Berlin, Venice, Colone, Hamburg.

We know Venice is in position 3 (clue 8). So position 3's city is Venice.

From clue 4: Van's city is Berlin. So wherever Van is in transport, that position's city is Berlin.

Also, clue 12: Lucky-Strike's city is Colone. So wherever Lucky-Strike is in cigars, that position's city is Colone.

The remaining cities are Hannover and Hamburg. So the cities in each position:

- Position 3: Venice

So we need to assign Hannover, Berlin, Colone, Hamburg to positions 1,2,4,5.

But clue 3: Hannover → January. So the position of Hannover must have January birthday.

Also, clue 5: January is to the right of July. So July is in a position left of January.

Since position 2 is September, let's consider possible positions for July and January.

Possible birthdays left: May, January, July, June.

We have position 2: September.

So remaining positions 1,3,4,5 for the other months.

But position 3's city is Venice, which is not Hannover, Berlin, Colone, or Hamburg. So Venice is in position 3.

Wait, no: cities are Hannover, Berlin, Venice, Colone, Hamburg. So Venice is one of the five. So position 3's city is Venice.

So cities:

1: ?

2: ?

3: Venice

4: ?

5: ?

Hannover is in some position (1,2,4,5) and that position has birthday January.

Also, clue 4: Van's city is Berlin. So van is in transport at some position, and that position's city is Berlin.

Clue 12: Lucky-Strike (cigar) is in the city Colone.

So Colone is the city where Lucky-Strike is smoked.

Let's start by trying to assign the cities.

Let me try to see if we can find where Hannover is.

Since Hannover's birthday is January, and clue 5 says January is to the right of July, so July must be in a position left of January.

Possible positions for January: 4 or 5 (since position 2 is September, and position 3's city is Venice. Wait, but position 3's city is Venice, which is separate. So if Hannover is in position 4 or 5, then January would be there, and July must be to the left.

But let's see:

Possible positions for Hannover (January):

If Hannover is in position 4, then January is at 4, so July must be in 1, 2, 3. But position 2 is September. So July could be in 1 or 3. However, position 3's city is Venice, so July's birthday could be in position 1 or 3.

But if Hannover is in position 5, then January is at 5, so July must be in 1-4. But position 2 is September, so July could be 1,3,4.

Alternatively, Hannover could be in position 2, but position 2's birthday is September, which conflicts. So Hannover cannot be in position 2. Similarly, Hannover can't be in position 3 because that's Venice. So Hannover is in 1,4,5. But Hannover's birthday is January, which is separate from September (position 2), so possible.

Wait, but position 2 is September. So if Hannover is in position 1, then January is at position 1, but that would mean July is to the left of January, which is impossible because position 1 is the leftmost. So that can't be. Therefore, Hannover must be in position 4 or 5.

If Hannover is in position 4, then January is at 4. Then July must be in a position less than 4 (1,2,3). But position 2 is September, so July could be in 1 or 3.

If Hannover is in position 5, then January is at 5. Then July must be in 1-4. Again, position 2 is September, so possible positions for July: 1,3,4.

But let's also consider clue 14: helicopter (position 1) is adjacent to September (position 2). So position 1's transport is helicopter, position 2's birthday is September.

Now, let's consider the months left: May, January, July, June.

We have:

Position 1: ?

Position 2: September

Position 3: ?

Position 4: ?

Position 5: ?

If Hannover is in position 4, then birthday is January there. So January at 4. Then July must be in 1,2,3. But position 2 is September, so July could be 1 or 3.

If July is in position 1, then position 1's birthday is July, and the birthday at position 4 is January. That satisfies clue 5 (July < January). Then remaining months: May and June would be in positions 3 and 5.

Alternatively, if Hannover is in position 5, then January is at 5. Then July must be in 1-4. Position 2 is September, so July could be 1,3,4.

But let's see if we can get more clues to resolve this.

Clue 7: Kools → June. So the Kools smoker's birthday is June. So wherever Kools is, that position's birthday is June.

Clue 1: Quad-bike → May. So the quad-bike driver's birthday is May.

Clue 13: Skateboard → Parliaments. So wherever skateboard is in transport, that's Parliaments in cigars.

Clue 12: Lucky-Strike → Colone. So wherever Lucky-Strike is in cigars, the city is Colone.

Clue 4: Van → Berlin. So wherever van is in transport, city is Berlin.

Clue 2: Ship → Dog. So ship in transport means dog in pets.

Clue 6: Old-Gold → Snails. So Old-Gold smoker has snails.

Clue 10: Chesterfields adjacent to Fox.

Clue 11: Kools adjacent to Horse.

Let me try to see if we can find the position of the van (Berlin) and Lucky-Strike (Colone).

Since cities left after Venice (position 3) are Hannover, Berlin, Colone, Hamburg in positions 1,2,4,5. But position 2's city is yet to be determined, but position 2's birthday is September, and Hannover's birthday is January. So if Hannover is in position 4 or 5, then the city Hannover is there.

Let me try to assign van to a position. Van's city is Berlin. Let's say van is in position X, so city X is Berlin. Then, Lucky-Strike is in Colone, which is another position.

Suppose van is in position 4. Then city 4 is Berlin. Then Lucky-Strike would be in Colone, say position 5. Then position 5's city is Colone, which is Lucky-Strike. Then Hannover would be in position 1 or 5, but position 5 is Colone. So Hannover must be in position 1. Wait, but position 1's city can't be Hannover because position 1's transport is helicopter. Wait, but city is separate. Let me check.

Wait, no: transport and city are separate categories. So position 1's transport is helicopter, but city could be Hannover. But if Hannover is in position 1, then birthday there is January (clue 3). But position 1's birthday would be January, and clue 5 says January is to the right of July. But position 1 is the leftmost, so there's no position to the left of it. Therefore, January can't be in position 1. So Hannover can't be in position 1. Therefore, Hannover must be in position 4 or 5.

So let's try Hannover in position 4: city 4 is Hannover, birthday 4 is January. Then, according to clue 5, July must be in a position less than 4 (1,2,3). Position 2 is September, so July could be 1 or 3.

If July is in position 1, then birthday 1 is July. Then remaining months are May and June for positions 3 and 5.

But clue 7 says Kools smoker has June. So Kools is in the position with June birthday, which would be position 3 or 5. Also, clue 1 says Quad-bike is May, so Quad-bike is in the position with May birthday. So May would be in position 3 or 5.

Wait, if position 1 is July, position 4 is January, position 2 is September, then remaining positions 3 and 5 need May and June.

So, if position 3's birthday is May, then Quad-bike would be in position 3. But position 3's city is Venice. So transport in position 3 would be Quad-bike, and city Venice. Then position 3's birthday is May. Then position 5's birthday would be June, so Kools smoker is there.

Alternatively, position 3's birthday is June (so Kools there), and position 5's birthday is May (Quad-bike there). But Quad-bike is linked to May (clue 1), so wherever May is, that's Quad-bike.

So let's see:

Option 1:

Position 1: July

Position 2: September

Position 3: May

Position 4: January

Position 5: June

Then Quad-bike is in position 3 (May). Kools is in position 5 (June). That works.

But let's check the cities:

Position 3's city is Venice.

Van is in a position, which must be Berlin. Let's say van is in position 4. Then city 4 is Berlin. But position 4's birthday is January, which is linked to Hannover (clue 3). Wait, no: clue 3 says Hannover's birthday is January, so if position 4's city is Hannover, then birthday is January. But if van is in position 4, then city 4 is Berlin. That's a conflict. So van can't be in position 4 if city 4 is Hannover.

Wait, this is confusing. Let's clarify:

If Hannover is in position 4, then city 4 is Hannover, and birthday 4 is January (clue 3). Then van must be in a position where the city is Berlin. So van's position's city is Berlin. So van can't be in position 4 (since city 4 is Hannover). So van must be in another position, say position 5. Then city 5 is Berlin. But position 5's birthday is June, which is linked to Kools. Then the van is in position 5, city Berlin, birthday June, Kools. Then Lucky-Strike is in Colone (clue 12), which would be another city. The remaining cities are Hamburg and Colone. So position 1's city would be either Hamburg or Colone. But Lucky-Strike is Colone, so if Lucky-Strike is in position X, then city X is Colone.

If van is in position 5 (Berlin), then cities:

1: ?

2: ?

3: Venice

4: Hannover

5: Berlin

But that can't be because position 5's city would be Berlin, but we also have Colone and Hamburg to assign. So maybe van is in position 2. But position 2's city would then be Berlin. But position 2's birthday is September. Is that allowed? Yes, because clue 3 says Hannover's birthday is January, so Berlin can be in any position except 4 (if Hannover is in 4). Wait, no: van's city is Berlin, so wherever van is, that's Berlin. So if van is in position 2, then city 2 is Berlin. But position 2's birthday is September, which is okay. Then, Hannover would be in position 4 (birthday January), and the remaining cities are Colone and Hamburg for positions 1 and 5.

But then Lucky-Strike (clue 12) must be in Colone. So the Lucky-Strike smoker is in the city Colone. So if Colone is in position 1 or 5.

Let's try:

Cities:

1: Colone or Hamburg

2: Berlin

3: Venice

4: Hannover

5: remaining (Colone or Hamburg)

But Lucky-Strike is in Colone. Suppose position 1 is Colone. Then Lucky-Strike is in position 1. But position 1's transport is helicopter. So cigar in position 1 would be Lucky-Strike. Then, according to clue 12, that's correct. But then the remaining city is Hamburg in position 5.

So cities:

1: Colone

2: Berlin

3: Venice

4: Hannover

5: Hamburg

But let's check if this works.

Now, cigars:

Position 1: Lucky-Strike (since city is Colone, per clue 12)

Position 2: ?

Position 3: ?

Position 4: ?

Position 5: ?

Also, clue 13: Skateboard → Parliaments. So wherever skateboard is, Parliaments is the cigar.

Clue 7: Kools is in June's position. June's position in this scenario: If birthdays are:

1: July

2: September

3: May

4: January

5: June

Then June is in position 5. So Kools is in position 5.

So cigar in position 5 is Kools? Wait, no: clue 7 says Kools smoker has June birthday. So position 5's birthday is June, so cigar there is Kools. Correct.

So position 5's cigar is Kools. But position 5's city is Hamburg. That's okay.

Then, cigars so far:

1: Lucky-Strike

5: Kools

We have remaining cigars: Old-Gold, Chesterfields, Parliaments.

Clue 6: Old-Gold → Snails. So need to find where Old-Gold is, and that's where snails are.

Clue 13: Skateboard → Parliaments. So wherever Skateboard is in transport, that's Parliaments in cigars.

Transport so far:

1: helicopter

2: ?

3: ?

4: ?

5: ?

From clue 1: Quad-bike is in May's position. May is in position 3. So transport in position 3 is Quad-bike.

So position 3's transport is Quad-bike.

Transport remaining: ship, van, skateboard.

Clue 2: Ship → Dog. So ship's position has Dog.

Clue 4: Van → Berlin (city). Van is in position 2, since city 2 is Berlin. So transport in position 2 is van. Wait, no: if van's city is Berlin, and city 2 is Berlin, then transport in position 2 is van. Yes.

So transport:

2: van

Then remaining transports: ship, skateboard for positions 4 and 5.

But position 5's transport can't be skateboard yet. Let's see.

Clue 13: Skateboard → Parliaments. So if skateboard is in position 4, then cigar there is Parliaments. If skateboard is in position 5, then cigar 5 is Parliaments. But position 5's cigar is Kools (from clue 7), so skateboard can't be in 5. Therefore, skateboard must be in position 4, and Parliaments there. Then position 5's transport is ship. Wait, but transports left are ship and skateboard. If skateboard is in 4, then ship is in 5.

But position 5's transport is ship. Then, per clue 2, ship's pet is Dog. So position 5's pet is Dog.

But let's check:

Transport:

1: helicopter

2: van

3: quad-bike

4: skateboard

5: ship

Cigars:

1: Lucky-Strike

2: ?

3: ?

4: Parliaments

5: Kools

Wait, position 5's cigar is Kools, which matches clue 7 (June birthday). Correct.

Now remaining cigars for positions 2 and 3: Old-Gold and Chesterfields.

Clue 6: Old-Gold → Snails. So need to place Old-Gold where the pet is snails.

Clue 10: Chesterfields adjacent to Fox. Let's see.

Pets so far:

5: Dog (from ship in position 5)

Remaining pets: Fox, Zebra, Horse, Snails.

We need to place these in positions 1-4.

Clue 11: Kools (position 5) is adjacent to Horse. So position 4's pet must be Horse (since position 5 is Kools, adjacent to 4). So position 4's pet is Horse.

Then, clue 11 is satisfied.

Then, remaining pets: Fox, Zebra, Snails in positions 1,2,3.

Clue 6: Old-Gold → Snails. So wherever Old-Gold is, that's Snails.

If Old-Gold is in position 3, then pet there is Snails. Then position 3's cigar is Old-Gold, pet is Snails.

Then, remaining cigars: Chesterfields in position 2.

Clue 10: Chesterfields adjacent to Fox. So Chesterfields in position 2 must have Fox in position 1 or 3. Position 3's pet is Snails, so Fox must be in position 1. Then position 1's pet is Fox.

Then, remaining pet is Zebra in position 2.

Wait, let's check:

Pets:

1: Fox

2: Zebra

3: Snails

4: Horse

5: Dog

Cigars:

1: Lucky-Strike

2: Chesterfields

3: Old-Gold

4: Parliaments

5: Kools

Clue 10: Chesterfields (position 2) adjacent to Fox (position 1). Yes, that works.

Clue 6: Old-Gold (position 3) → Snails (position 3). Correct.

Clue 13: Skateboard (position 4) → Parliaments (position 4). Correct.

Clue 12: Lucky-Strike (position 1) → Colone (city position 1). Correct.

Clue 4: Van (position 2) → Berlin (city position 2). Correct.

Clue 3: Hannover (position 4) → January (birthday position 4). Wait, no: city position 4 is Hannover? Wait, in our cities earlier:

Cities:

1: Colone

2: Berlin

3: Venice

4: Hannover

5: Hamburg

Yes. So birthday in position 4 is January, which matches Hannover. Correct.

Clue 5: January (position 4) is to the right of July (position 1). Yes, 1 < 4. Correct.

Clue 1: Quad-bike (position 3) → May (position 3). Correct.

Clue 2: Ship (position 5) → Dog (position 5). Correct.

Clue 7: Kools (position 5) → June (position 5). Wait, position 5's birthday is June? Wait, in our birthday assignments:

Birthdays:

1: July

2: September

3: May

4: January

5: June

Yes, so position 5's birthday is June, and Kools is there. Correct.

Clue 14: Helicopter (position 1) adjacent to September (position 2). Yes, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent. Correct.

Clue 8: Venice is position 3. Correct.

Clue 9: Helicopter is position 1. Correct.

Clue 10: Chesterfields (position 2) adjacent to Fox (position 1). Correct.

Clue 11: Kools (position 5) adjacent to Horse (position 4). Correct.

Now, check if all pets are placed: Dog (5), Horse (4), Snails (3), Fox (1), Zebra (2). Yes.

Cigars: Lucky-Strike (1), Chesterfields (2), Old-Gold (3), Parliaments (4), Kools (5). All accounted for.

Transport: helicopter (1), van (2), quad-bike (3), skateboard (4), ship (5). Correct.

Cities: Colone (1), Berlin (2), Venice (3), Hannover (4), Hamburg (5). Correct.

Birthdays: July (1), September (2), May (3), January (4), June (5). Wait, but birthday in position 5 is June, which is correct per clue 7 (Kools there). Yes.

Everything seems to fit. Let me just verify all clues once more to be sure.

1. Quad-bike (3) → May (3). ✔️

2. Ship (5) → Dog (5). ✔️

3. Hannover (4) → January (4). ✔️

4. Van (2) → Berlin (2). ✔️

5. January (4) is right of July (1). ✔️

6. Old-Gold (3) → Snails (3). ✔️

7. Kools (5) → June (5). ✔️

8. Venice (3). ✔️

9. Helicopter (1). ✔️

10. Chesterfields (2) adjacent to Fox (1). ✔️

11. Kools (5) adjacent to Horse (4). ✔️

12. Lucky-Strike (1) → Colone (1). ✔️

13. Skateboard (4) → Parliaments (4). ✔️

14. Helicopter (1) adjacent to September (2). ✔️

All clues are satisfied. So the final table is:

Transport: 1 - helicopter, 2 - van, 3 - quad-bike, 4 - skateboard, 5 - ship

Birthday: 1 - July, 2 - September, 3 - May, 4 - January, 5 - June

City: 1 - Colone, 2 - Berlin, 3 - Venice, 4 - Hannover, 5 - Hamburg

Cigar: 1 - Lucky-Strike, 2 - Chesterfields, 3 - Old-Gold, 4 - Parliaments, 5 - Kools

Pet: 1 - Fox, 2 - Zebra, 3 - Snails, 4 - Horse, 5 - Dog

R1-Zebra-3domain-3	"Okay, let's try to solve this logic puzzle. It's similar to the Einstein puzzle, so maybe some of the same strategies will work here. Let's start by listing all the categories and the clues given.

First, the categories are Nationality, Sport, Birthday, Cigar, and Game. Each of these has five different options, and each person (numbered 1 to 5) has one of each. The goal is to fill out the table correctly based on the clues.

Let me list the clues again to make sure I have them all:

1. The English person prefers cycling.

2. The Spanish person plays poker.

3. The person with a March birthday plays ice-hockey.

4. The Ukrainian has a December birthday.

5. Ice-hockey is to the right of basketball.

6. Old Gold smoker plays snooker.

7. Kools smoker plays baseball.

8. May birthday is in the middle (position 3).

9. Norwegian is on the far left (position 1).

10. Chesterfields smoker is adjacent to the billiard player.

11. Kools smoker is adjacent to domino player.

12. Lucky Strike smoker has a September birthday.

13. Japanese person smokes Parliaments.

14. Norwegian is adjacent to surfing.

Alright, let's start with the clues that give direct positions.

Clue 9 says Norwegian is in position 1. So Nationality 1 is Norwegian.

Clue 8 says the birthday in May is in position 3. So Birthday 3 is May.

Clue 4 says Ukrainian has December birthday. So wherever Ukrainian is, their birthday is December. So Nationality: Ukrainian → Birthday: December.

Clue 3: March birthday → Sport: Ice-hockey.

Clue 1: English → Sport: Cycling.

Clue 2: Spanish → Game: Poker.

Clue 13: Japanese → Cigar: Parliaments.

Clue 12: Lucky Strike → Birthday: September.

Clue 7: Kools → Sport: Baseball.

Clue 6: Old Gold → Game: Snooker.

Clue 14: Norwegian (position 1) is adjacent to surfing. So Sport in position 2 must be surfing (since position 1 is Norwegian, and adjacent is position 2).

Wait, but the sports are cycling, ice-hockey, basketball, baseball, surfing. Let me check. If position 1 is Norwegian, then position 2's sport is surfing (because of clue 14). So Sport 2 = surfing.

But clue 5 says ice-hockey is to the right of basketball. So basketball must be somewhere left of ice-hockey. Let's note that.

Also, clue 10: Chesterfields adjacent to billiard. Clue 11: Kools adjacent to domino.

Let me start building the table step by step.

Position 1: Nationality = Norwegian (from clue 9). Sport: Let's see. The Norwegian is adjacent to surfing (clue 14), so position 2's sport is surfing. So Sport 2 = surfing.

So Sport 1 must be one of the remaining: cycling, ice-hockey, basketball, baseball. But clue 1 says English person is cycling. Since position 1 is Norwegian, not English, so Sport 1 can't be cycling. So Sport 1 could be basketball, ice-hockey, or baseball. But clue 5 says ice-hockey is to the right of basketball. So if ice-hockey is in position x, basketball must be in x-1. Let's see.

If Sport 2 is surfing, then the remaining sports are cycling, ice-hockey, basketball, baseball. Let's see. The English person is cycling (clue 1), so English nationality must be in some position where Sport is cycling.

Let's try to place the sports with the clues.

Clue 7: Kools smoker plays baseball. So Sport = Baseball → Cigar = Kools.

Clue 3: March birthday → Sport = Ice-hockey.

Clue 5: Ice-hockey is right of basketball. So Basketball must be to the left of Ice-hockey.

Possible placements:

If Basketball is in position 1, Ice-hockey in 2, but position 2 is surfing, so no. If Basketball in 2, Ice-hockey in 3, but position 2 is surfing. So maybe Basketball in 3, Ice-hockey in 4. Wait, position 3's birthday is May (clue 8). But clue 3 says March birthday → Ice-hockey. So Ice-hockey must be in the person whose birthday is March. So if Sport is Ice-hockey, birthday is March. Therefore, the person with March birthday has Sport Ice-hockey, and that person must be somewhere where their birthday is March, and their sport is Ice-hockey.

So let's map birthdays. Birthdays are March, December, May, September, August. We know May is in position 3 (clue 8), December is Ukrainian's birthday (clue 4), September is Lucky Strike smoker (clue 12), and March is Ice-hockey (clue 3). So remaining birthday months are August and the others?

Wait, birthdays are March, December, May, September, August. So let's list:

Position 1: ?

Position 2: ?

Position 3: May

Position 4: ?

Position 5: ?

Ukrainian is in some position, and their birthday is December. So Ukrainian's position has birthday December. So December is in some position, not 3.

Clue 12: Lucky Strike smoker has September birthday. So September is in some position, and that person smokes Lucky Strike.

Clue 3: March birthday → Ice-hockey. So wherever March is, that's Ice-hockey.

Clue 4: Ukrainian → December.

Clue 1: English → Cycling.

Clue 2: Spanish → Poker.

Clue 13: Japanese → Parliaments.

Clue 7: Kools → Baseball.

Clue 6: Old Gold → Snooker.

Clue 10: Chesterfields adjacent to Billiard.

Clue 11: Kools adjacent to Domino.

Clue 14: Norwegian (position 1) adjacent to Surfing (position 2).

So let's start filling in:

Nationality:

1: Norwegian

2: ?

3: ?

4: ?

5: ?

Sport:

1: ?

2: Surfing

3: ?

4: ?

5: ?

Birthday:

3: May

Others: March, December, September, August.

Cigar:

13: Japanese (some position) → Parliaments.

12: Lucky Strike → September birthday.

7: Kools → Baseball.

6: Old Gold → Snooker.

Games:

2: Spanish → Poker (since clue 2 says Spanish plays poker; so wherever Spanish is, Game is Poker. So Nationality Spanish → Game Poker. So Spanish must be in a position where Game is Poker.

But Game Poker is in some position. Let's note that.

Let me try to assign nationalities:

We have Norwegian (1), English (somewhere, since clue 1 says English → Cycling), Spanish (somewhere with Game Poker), Ukrainian (December birthday), Japanese (Parliaments). So nationalities are English, Spanish, Ukrainian, Norwegian, Japanese.

So position 1: Norwegian.

Then, positions 2-5: English, Spanish, Ukrainian, Japanese.

Let's see where Ukrainian is. Since Ukrainian's birthday is December, which is one of the months. Let's see possible positions for December.

Available birthdays after May in position 3: March, December, September, August.

Position 3: May.

So December could be in positions 1,2,4,5. But position 1 is Norwegian, and Ukrainian is a nationality, so Ukrainian can't be in position 1 (already Norwegian). So Ukrainian must be in 2,4,5. Let's say Ukrainian is in position x, and their birthday is December.

Similarly, English is in the position where Sport is Cycling.

Let's try to assign Sports.

Sport 2 is Surfing (from clue 14). So position 2's sport is Surfing.

So remaining sports: Cycling, Ice-hockey, Basketball, Baseball.

Clue 1: English → Cycling. So wherever English is, their sport is Cycling.

Clue 7: Kools → Baseball. So the Baseball player smokes Kools.

Clue 3: March birthday → Ice-hockey.

Clue 5: Ice-hockey is right of Basketball. So Basketball must be to the left of Ice-hockey.

Let's try to place Basketball and Ice-hockey.

If Ice-hockey is in position 4, then Basketball must be in 3, but position 3's birthday is May. But clue 3 says Ice-hockey's birthday is March, so Ice-hockey is in March's position. So the person with March birthday is in position x, and their sport is Ice-hockey. So March must be assigned to a position where sport is Ice-hockey, and that position is to the right of Basketball.

So let's suppose March is in position 4. Then Ice-hockey is in 4, and Basketball must be in 3 (since 3 is to the left of 4). But position 3's birthday is May, so that's possible. But then the sport for position 3 would be Basketball, and the sport for 4 is Ice-hockey. Then, the person in position 4 has birthday March? But position 3's birthday is May. Wait, no. Wait, the person with March birthday has sport Ice-hockey. So if Ice-hockey is in position 4, then birthday March is in position 4. But position 3's birthday is May. Then March is in position 4, birthday May in 3, December somewhere else.

But then the sport for position 4 is Ice-hockey, which requires birthday March. So position 4's birthday is March, which is possible. Then Basketball would be in position 3, since Ice-hockey is to the right of Basketball. But position 3's sport would be Basketball, and birthday May. That works. Let's tentatively assign:

Position 4: Birthday March, Sport Ice-hockey.

Position 3: Birthday May, Sport Basketball.

Then, position 5 would have remaining sports: Cycling or Baseball. Since position 1's sport is still unknown. Let's see.

Clue 1: English person's sport is Cycling. So if Cycling is in position 1, then the nationality there is English. But position 1 is Norwegian. So Cycling can't be in position 1. Therefore, Cycling must be in another position. Let's see: remaining sports after Surfing (2), Ice-hockey (4), Basketball (3) are Cycling and Baseball. So positions 1 and 5.

But position 1's nationality is Norwegian, so their sport can't be Cycling (since English is Cycling). So Cycling must be in position 5, and Baseball in position 1? Wait, no. Wait, the remaining sports are Cycling and Baseball. Let's see:

If position 1's sport is Baseball, then cigar is Kools (clue 7). But then position 1's nationality is Norwegian, sport Baseball, cigar Kools. Then position 5 would have sport Cycling, which is English. So Nationality 5 is English.

Alternatively, position 1's sport could be Cycling, but that would require Nationality 1 to be English, which it's not (it's Norwegian). So position 1 can't be Cycling. Therefore, position 5 must be Cycling (Sport 5 = Cycling), which makes Nationality 5 = English (from clue 1). Then Sport 1 would be Baseball, making Cigar 1 = Kools (from clue 7). But let's check:

If Sport 1 is Baseball, then Cigar 1 is Kools. Then position 5's sport is Cycling, nationality English.

Then the sports would be:

1: Baseball (Kools)

2: Surfing

3: Basketball

4: Ice-hockey (March birthday)

5: Cycling (English)

Now, let's check the birthdays. We have:

Position 3: May

Position 4: March

Remaining birthdays: December, September, August.

Ukrainian's birthday is December (clue 4), so Ukrainian must be in a position with December. Let's assign December to position 2, 5, or another.

But position 5's nationality is English (from clue 1), so Ukrainian must be in another position. Let's see:

Nationalities assigned so far:

1: Norwegian

5: English

So remaining nationalities for positions 2,3,4: Spanish, Ukrainian, Japanese.

Position 2: Nationality? Let's see. Sport 2 is Surfing. No direct clues, but let's check other clues.

Clue 2: Spanish plays Poker. So Spanish is in the position where Game is Poker. So Game in some position is Poker, and that's Spanish's position.

So let's see, the Games are Poker, Billiard, Backgammon, Domino, Snooker.

Clue 6: Old Gold smoker plays Snooker.

Clue 10: Chesterfields adjacent to Billiard.

Clue 11: Kools adjacent to Domino.

Clue 13: Japanese smokes Parliaments.

So let's try to assign Games.

Position 1: Sport Baseball, Cigar Kools (clue 7). So Game for position 1? Let's see. Kools is in position 1 (from clue 7). Clue 11 says Kools is adjacent to Domino. So position 1's Game must be adjacent to Domino. Since position 1 is first, adjacent is position 2. So if position 2's Game is Domino, that satisfies clue 11. But position 2's Game could be Domino, but we need to check other clues.

Alternatively, position 1 is Kools (Cigar 1 = Kools), so adjacent (position 2) must have Game Domino. So Game 2 = Domino. But clue 2 says Spanish plays Poker. If position 2's Game is Domino, then Spanish can't be there. So Spanish must be in another position where Game is Poker.

Let's think. Games: Poker, Billiard, Backgammon, Domino, Snooker.

Clue 6: Old Gold → Snooker. So Game Snooker is in some position, and that person smokes Old Gold.

Clue 10: Chesterfields adjacent to Billiard. So wherever Chesterfields is, next to Billiard.

Clue 11: Kools (position 1) adjacent to Domino. So position 2's Game is Domino.

Thus, Game 2 = Domino.

Then, position 1's adjacent (position 2) has Domino, satisfying clue 11.

Now, Games left: Poker, Billiard, Backgammon, Snooker.

Clue 2: Spanish plays Poker. So Spanish is in the position where Game is Poker. Let's assign Game 5 = Poker, making Nationality 5 = Spanish. Wait, but Nationality 5 is already English (from clue 1, since Sport 5 is Cycling). Wait, no. Wait, earlier I thought Sport 5 is Cycling, so Nationality 5 is English (clue 1: English → Cycling). But clue 2 says Spanish plays Poker. So Spanish must be in the position where Game is Poker. So Game Poker is in some position, and that's Spanish's nationality.

But if position 5's nationality is English, then Game Poker must be in another position. Let's see:

If Game 2 is Domino (from clue 11), then remaining Games are Poker, Billiard, Backgammon, Snooker.

Clue 6: Old Gold → Snooker. So Snooker is in some position, and that person smokes Old Gold.

Clue 10: Chesterfields adjacent to Billiard.

Clue 13: Japanese → Parliaments.

Cigars: Kools (1), Old Gold (Snooker), Lucky Strike (September birthday), Parliaments (Japanese), and Chesterfields.

So let's try to assign.

Position 1: Cigar Kools.

Position 6 (Old Gold) is with Snooker.

Position 12: Lucky Strike is September birthday.

Position 13: Japanese (some position) → Parliaments.

So let's assign birthdays:

Position 3: May

Position 4: March

Remaining birthdays: December, September, August.

Position 5: ?

Position 2: ?

Position 1: ?

We know Ukrainian is December (clue 4), so wherever Ukrainian is, their birthday is December.

Lucky Strike is September (clue 12), so some position has September birthday and Lucky Strike cigar.

So possible assignments:

Let's say position 5 has September birthday (Lucky Strike), position 2 has December (Ukrainian), position 1 has August.

But let's check:

Nationalities:

1: Norwegian

2: ?

3: ?

4: ?

5: English (since Sport 5 is Cycling)

So remaining nationalities: Spanish, Ukrainian, Japanese.

If position 2 is Ukrainian (December birthday), then:

Position 2: Nationality Ukrainian, Birthday December, Sport Surfing, Game Domino.

Then, position 5: English, Sport Cycling, Game ?

Position 4: Sport Ice-hockey (March birthday), Nationality ?

Position 3: Sport Basketball, Birthday May, Nationality ?

Position 1: Norwegian, Sport Baseball, Cigar Kools, Game ?

Let's assign Games:

Position 1: Game ?

Position 2: Domino

Position 3: ?

Position 4: ?

Position 5: ?

Clue 2: Spanish plays Poker. So Spanish must be in a position where Game is Poker. Let's assign Game 5 = Poker, making Nationality 5 = Spanish. But wait, Nationality 5 was supposed to be English because Sport 5 is Cycling (clue 1). This is a conflict. So that can't be right.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let's backtrack.

Clue 1: English person's sport is Cycling. So wherever Cycling is, that's English. So if Sport 5 is Cycling, then Nationality 5 is English. But clue 2 says Spanish plays Poker. So Spanish must be in a position where Game is Poker. So Game Poker is in some position, and that's Spanish's nationality.

So let's try to assign Games:

Available Games: Poker, Billiard, Backgammon, Snooker (since position 2 is Domino).

Clue 6: Old Gold → Snooker. So Snooker is in some position, let's say position 4: Game Snooker, Cigar Old Gold.

Clue 10: Chesterfields adjacent to Billiard. So if Chesterfields is in position x, then Billiard is in x±1.

Clue 13: Japanese → Parliaments. So Japanese is in some position, and Cigar there is Parliaments.

Cigars assigned so far:

1: Kools

4: Old Gold (if Game 4 is Snooker)

5: ?

2: ?

3: ?

Lucky Strike is in September's position (clue 12), which would be position x with birthday September. So let's assign September to position 5. Then:

Position 5: Birthday September, Cigar Lucky Strike.

Then, Nationality 5: English (from clue 1, since Sport 5 is Cycling). So Nationality 5 = English, Sport 5 = Cycling, Birthday September, Cigar Lucky Strike, Game ?

Game for position 5: remaining Games are Poker, Billiard, Backgammon. Since clue 2 says Spanish plays Poker, and Spanish hasn't been assigned yet. So let's say Game 5 is Backgammon, but then Spanish must be in a position with Poker. Let's see:

Available Games for positions 1,3,4:

Position 1: ?

Position 3: ?

Position 4: Snooker

So remaining Games: Poker, Billiard, Backgammon.

If position 3's Game is Billiard, then according to clue 10, Chesterfields would be adjacent. Let's try:

Position 3: Game Billiard. Then Chesterfields must be in position 2 or 4. But position 4's Cigar is Old Gold (from clue 6). So Chesterfields could be in position 2 or 4. Position 2's Cigar is not yet assigned.

Alternatively, position 4 has Game Snooker (Old Gold), so position 3 could have Game Billiard, and position 2's Cigar is Chesterfields. Then, Chesterfields (position 2) is adjacent to Billiard (position 3), satisfying clue 10.

So:

Position 2: Cigar Chesterfields (adjacent to Billiard in 3)

Position 3: Game Billiard

Then, remaining Games: Poker and Backgammon for positions 1 and 5.

But position 5's Game hasn't been assigned yet. Let's say position 5's Game is Backgammon, then position 1's Game is Poker. But clue 2 says Spanish plays Poker. So position 1's Game is Poker → Nationality 1 is Spanish. But position 1's Nationality is Norwegian (clue 9). Contradiction. So that can't be.

Therefore, position 5's Game must be Poker. Then Nationality 5 is Spanish, but Nationality 5 was supposed to be English (since Sport 5 is Cycling). Conflict again. So this approach isn't working.

Let me try a different assignment. Maybe position 4's birthday is August, and September is position 5. Let's see:

Birthdays:

1: August

2: December (Ukrainian)

3: May

4: March (Ice-hockey)

5: September (Lucky Strike)

Then, Cigars:

1: Kools (since Sport 1 is Baseball)

2: ?

3: ?

4: Old Gold (Snooker)

5: Lucky Strike

Nationalities:

1: Norwegian

2: Ukrainian

3: ?

4: ?

5: English (Sport Cycling)

Remaining nationalities: Spanish, Japanese.

Clue 2: Spanish plays Poker. So Spanish must be in a position where Game is Poker. Let's assign Game 3 to Poker, making Nationality 3: Spanish. But then Sport 3 is Basketball. So:

Position 3: Nationality Spanish, Sport Basketball, Game Poker, Birthday May.

That works with clue 2.

Then, remaining nationality is Japanese in position 4.

Position 4: Nationality Japanese, Cigar Parliaments (clue 13), Sport Ice-hockey, Birthday March, Game Snooker (Old Gold? Wait, clue 6 says Old Gold smoker plays Snooker. So if Game 4 is Snooker, Cigar 4 is Old Gold. But clue 13 says Japanese smokes Parliaments. So position 4's Cigar should be Parliaments, but clue 6 says Snooker is Old Gold. Contradiction here.

Ah, problem. So position 4's Game is Snooker (Old Gold), but position 4's Nationality is Japanese, so Cigar must be Parliaments (clue 13). Therefore, contradiction. So this approach is wrong.

So perhaps the error is in assigning position 4's Game as Snooker. Let's try another way.

Let me start over with the birthdays.

We have:

Position 3: May

Ukrainian is December, so position x has December.

Possible positions for December: 2,4,5.

If position 2 is December (Ukrainian), then:

Position 2: Nationality Ukrainian, Birthday December, Sport Surfing.

Position 4: March (Ice-hockey), Sport Ice-hockey.

Position 5: September (Lucky Strike), Sport Cycling (English), Nationality English.

Position 1: Norwegian, Sport Baseball (Kools), Game ?

Position 3: Sport Basketball, Nationality ?

Position 4: Nationality Japanese (since remaining are Spanish and Japanese), but Japanese must smoke Parliaments (clue 13). So position 4: Cigar Parliaments, but clue 6 says Old Gold smoker plays Snooker. Let's see.

Games:

Position 1: ?

Position 2: ?

Position 3: ?

Position 4: ?

Position 5: ?

Clue 2: Spanish plays Poker. So Spanish must be in a position where Game is Poker.

Clue 6: Old Gold → Snooker.

Clue 10: Chesterfields adjacent to Billiard.

Clue 11: Kools (position 1) adjacent to Domino.

Let's assign Game 2 as Domino (adjacent to Kools in 1). So Game 2 = Domino.

Then, position 1's adjacent (position 2) has Domino, satisfying clue 11.

Now, remaining Games: Poker, Billiard, Backgammon, Snooker.

Clue 6: Snooker is Old Gold. Let's assign Game 4 = Snooker, Cigar 4 = Old Gold.

Then position 4: Game Snooker, Cigar Old Gold.

Position 4's Nationality: Japanese (since remaining after Norwegian, Ukrainian, English, Spanish). So Nationality 4 = Japanese, Cigar Parliaments (clue 13). Wait, but position 4's Cigar is Old Gold (from clue 6). Contradiction. So this doesn't work.

Therefore, position 4 can't be both Japanese (Parliaments) and Old Gold. Therefore, maybe Snooker is in position 5.

Let's try:

Position 5: Game Snooker, Cigar Old Gold (clue 6). Then Nationality 5 is English (Sport Cycling), but Cigar would be Old Gold. But clue 13 says Japanese smokes Parliaments, so position 5 can't be Japanese. So Nationality 5 is English, Sport Cycling, Game Snooker, Cigar Old Gold. But then Japanese must be in another position.

Position 4: Nationality Japanese, Cigar Parliaments.

Then, position 4's Game? Available Games: Poker, Billiard, Backgammon.

Clue 10: Chesterfields adjacent to Billiard. So if position 4's Game is Billiard, then Chesterfields would be in 3 or 5. But position 5's Cigar is Old Gold. So Chesterfields could be in position 3.

Let's assign Game 4 = Billiard. Then Cigar 3 or 5 is Chesterfields. But position 5's Cigar is Old Gold. So Cigar 3 = Chesterfields. Then, position 3: Cigar Chesterfields, adjacent to Billiard (position 4), satisfying clue 10.

Then, remaining Games: Poker and Backgammon.

Clue 2: Spanish plays Poker. So Game Poker must be in position 3 or 1 or elsewhere.

Position 3's Game: If position 3's Game is Backgammon, then Spanish must be in position x with Game Poker.

But let's see:

Position 1: Game ?

Position 2: Domino

Position 3: Backgammon

Position 4: Billiard

Position 5: Snooker

Then, remaining Game is Poker, so position 1's Game is Poker. Thus, Nationality 1 is Spanish (clue 2). But position 1 is Norwegian (clue 9). Contradiction.

Therefore, this assignment is impossible.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to adjust the birthday assignments.

Let me try assigning December to position 5. So:

Position 5: Nationality Ukrainian (since Ukrainian has December birthday), Birthday December.

But position 5's sport would be? Sport 5 is Cycling (English), but Ukrainian can't be English. So this is a problem. So December can't be in position 5 if Sport 5 is Cycling and Nationality 5 is English.

Therefore, December must be in position 2 or 4.

Let me try December in position 2:

Position 2: Nationality Ukrainian, Birthday December, Sport Surfing.

Then, position 4's birthday is March (Ice-hockey).

Position 5's birthday is September (Lucky Strike), Nationality English (Sport Cycling).

Position 1: Norwegian, Sport Baseball (Kools), Game ?

Position 3: Sport Basketball, Birthday May, Nationality ?

Position 4: Sport Ice-hockey, Birthday March, Nationality ?

Remaining nationalities: Spanish, Japanese.

Clue 2: Spanish plays Poker. So Spanish must be in a position where Game is Poker.

Let's assign Games:

Position 1: Game ?

Position 2: Game Domino (due to clue 11: Kools adjacent to Domino; position 1's adjacent is 2, so Game 2 = Domino)

Position 3: Game ?

Position 4: Game ?

Position 5: Game ?

Clue 6: Old Gold → Snooker. So Snooker in some position.

Clue 10: Chesterfields adjacent to Billiard.

Clue 13: Japanese → Parliaments.

Cigars:

1: Kools

5: Lucky Strike (September birthday)

4: ?

3: ?

2: ?

Nationalities:

Position 4: Japanese (remaining) → Cigar Parliaments.

So position 4: Cigar Parliaments.

But clue 6 says Old Gold is Snooker. So Game Snooker must be in a position, Cigar Old Gold.

Let's assign Game 4: Snooker, Cigar Old Gold. But position 4's Cigar should be Parliaments (Japanese). Contradiction. So position 4 can't be both.

Therefore, Game Snooker must be elsewhere. Let's assign Game 3: Snooker, Cigar Old Gold. Then position 3: Game Snooker, Cigar Old Gold. Nationality 3: ?

Remaining nationalities: Spanish and Japanese.

If position 3 is Spanish, then Game must be Poker (clue 2). But position 3's Game is Snooker. Contradiction. So position 3 can't be Spanish. Therefore, position 3 is Japanese, but Japanese must have Parliaments (clue 13), but position 3's Cigar is Old Gold. Contradiction.

This is not working. Maybe Game Snooker is in position 5. Position 5: Game Snooker, Cigar Old Gold. Nationality 5: English (Sport Cycling), which is okay. Then position 4: Game ? Let's see:

Position 4: Sport Ice-hockey, Birthday March, Nationality Japanese (Cigar Parliaments), Game ?

Available Games: Poker, Billiard, Backgammon.

Clue 2: Spanish plays Poker. So Spanish must be in a position with Poker. Let's assign Game 4: Billiard. Then, according to clue 10, Chesterfields must be adjacent. So position 3 or 5 has Chesterfields. Position 3's Cigar is unknown.

Position 3: Nationality Spanish (since remaining), Game Poker (clue 2). So Nationality 3: Spanish, Game Poker, Cigar ? But position 3's Game would be Poker, which requires Nationality Spanish. That works.

So:

Position 3: Nationality Spanish, Sport Basketball, Game Poker, Cigar ?

Cigars left: Chesterfields, Parliaments (position 4: Japanese → Parliaments), Lucky Strike (position 5: September), Old Gold (position 5: Snooker).

Wait, position 5: Game Snooker → Cigar Old Gold (clue 6). Nationality 5: English, Sport Cycling, Birthday September (Lucky Strike?), no. Wait, position 5's Cigar should be Lucky Strike (clue 12: Lucky Strike smoker has September birthday). But position 5's Game is Snooker (Old Gold). Contradiction.

Ah, right. Clue 12 says Lucky Strike smoker has September birthday. So position 5: Birthday September → Cigar Lucky Strike. But clue 6 says Old Gold smoker plays Snooker. So if position 5's Game is Snooker, Cigar is Old Gold, but that contradicts clue 12. Therefore, position 5 can't have both September birthday and Snooker.

Thus, position 5's Game can't be Snooker. So Snooker must be in another position.

Let me try again:

Position 5: Birthday September (Lucky Strike), Game ?

Position 5's Sport is Cycling (English), Nationality English.

Games left: Poker, Billiard, Backgammon, Snooker.

Clue 6: Old Gold → Snooker. So Snooker is in some position, Cigar Old Gold.

Let's assign Snooker to position 4: Game Snooker, Cigar Old Gold.

Then position 4: Nationality Japanese (remaining), Cigar Old Gold. But clue 13 says Japanese smokes Parliaments. Contradiction. So Snooker can't be in position 4.

Snooker must be in position 1, but position 1's Game? Position 1's Sport is Baseball (Kools), Nationality Norwegian.

Game 1: Snooker → Cigar Old Gold. That works. So position 1: Game Snooker, Cigar Old Gold. But position 1's Cigar is Kools (clue 7: Kools → Baseball). Contradiction. Can't be.

Thus, this puzzle is really challenging. Let's try a different approach by focusing on the nationalities and cigars.

Nationalities: Norwegian (1), English, Spanish, Ukrainian, Japanese.

Cigars: Kools, Old Gold, Chesterfields, Lucky Strike, Parliaments.

Clues:

- English → Cycling (sport) → position x.

- Spanish → Poker (game) → position y.

- Ukrainian → December (birthday) → position z.

- Japanese → Parliaments (cigar) → position w.

- Norwegian (1) adjacent to Surfing (sport) → position 2's sport is Surfing.

- Kools → Baseball (sport) → position a.

- Old Gold → Snooker (game) → position b.

- Lucky Strike → September (birthday) → position c.

- Chesterfields adjacent to Billiard.

- Kools adjacent to Domino.

Let's try to assign:

Position 1:

Nationality: Norwegian

Sport: ?

Cigar: ?

Game: ?

Birthday: ?

Position 2:

Sport: Surfing

Nationality: ?

Cigar: ?

Game: ?

Birthday: ?

Position 3:

Birthday: May

Sport: ?

Nationality: ?

Cigar: ?

Game: ?

Position 4:

Sport: ?

Nationality: ?

Cigar: ?

Game: ?

Birthday: ?

Position 5:

Sport: ?

Nationality: ?

Cigar: ?

Game: ?

Birthday: ?

From clue 7: Kools → Baseball. So wherever Baseball is, that's Kools. Let's assume Baseball is position 1's sport (since Norwegian is there, and clue 7 doesn't restrict nationality). So:

Position 1:

Sport: Baseball

Cigar: Kools

Then, from clue 11: Kools (position 1) adjacent to Domino. So position 2's Game is Domino.

Position 2:

Game: Domino

Now, clue 5: Ice-hockey is right of Basketball. So Basketball must be left of Ice-hockey.

Clue 3: March birthday → Ice-hockey.

So Ice-hockey is in some position with March birthday.

Let's assign:

Position 4:

Sport: Ice-hockey

Birthday: March

Then, Basketball must be in position 3 (since it's to the left of 4).

Position 3:

Sport: Basketball

Birthday: May (given)

Now, remaining sports: Cycling and Surfing. Wait, Surfing is already in position 2. So remaining sports are Cycling and Baseball. But Baseball is in position 1. So remaining sport is Cycling, which must be in position 5 (since position 1 is Baseball, 2 Surfing, 3 Basketball, 4 Ice-hockey).

Position 5:

Sport: Cycling

Nationality: English (clue 1)

Now, Nationalities:

1: Norwegian

5: English

Remaining: Spanish, Ukrainian, Japanese

Position 2's Nationality: ?

Position 3's Nationality: ?

Position 4's Nationality: ?

Clue 2: Spanish plays Poker. So Spanish is in the position where Game is Poker. Let's assign Game 3 to Poker (since position 3's Sport is Basketball, and we need to assign Games).

Position 3:

Game: Poker

Nationality: Spanish

Then, position 3's Nationality is Spanish.

Now, remaining Nationalities: Ukrainian and Japanese.

Position 4: Nationality? Let's assign Ukrainian (since clue 4 says Ukrainian has December birthday). So:

Position 4:

Nationality: Ukrainian

Birthday: December

But position 4's birthday is March (from earlier assignment). Conflict. So this can't be.

Thus, there's a mistake. Earlier assumption that position 4 has March birthday and Ice-hockey is conflicting with Ukrainian having December birthday.

Let's adjust. Maybe Ice-hockey is in position 5.

Wait, position 5's sport is Cycling (English), so Ice-hockey can't be there. Let's try assigning Ice-hockey to position 4, March birthday.

But then Ukrainian must be in a position with December birthday. Let's assign position 2's birthday to December, making Nationality 2 Ukrainian.

Position 2:

Nationality: Ukrainian

Birthday: December

Sport: Surfing

Game: Domino

Then, position 4:

Sport: Ice-hockey

Birthday: March

Nationality: Japanese (remaining)

Cigar: Parliaments (clue 13)

Position 5:

Sport: Cycling

Nationality: English

Birthday: ?

Remaining birthdays: August and September.

Clue 12: Lucky Strike → September birthday. So position 5's birthday could be September, making Cigar Lucky Strike.

Thus:

Position 5:

Birthday: September

Cigar: Lucky Strike

Then, position 1's birthday is August (remaining birthday).

Position 1:

Birthday: August

Cigar: Kools

Now, let's assign Games:

Position 1: Game ?

Position 2: Domino

Position 3: Poker (Spanish)

Position 4: Game ?

Position 5: Game ?

Clue 6: Old Gold → Snooker. So Snooker must be in some position with Cigar Old Gold.

Remaining Games: Billiard, Backgammon, Snooker.

Clue 10: Chesterfields adjacent to Billiard.

Position 4: Nationality Japanese, Cigar Parliaments. So position 4's Game can't be Snooker (needs Old Gold). So Snooker must be in position 1 or 5.

Position 1's Game: ?

If position 1's Game is Snooker, then Cigar Old Gold. But position 1's Cigar is Kools. Conflict. So position 5's Game is Snooker, Cigar Old Gold. But position 5's Cigar is Lucky Strike. Conflict. So Snooker must be in position 4.

But position 4's Cigar is Parliaments (Japanese), so can't be Old Gold. Therefore, no available positions for Snooker. Contradiction.

This suggests an error in previous assignments. Let's backtrack.

Alternative approach: Maybe Ice-hockey is in position 5, March birthday. Then:

Position 5:

Sport: Ice-hockey

Birthday: March

But position 5's sport is supposed to be Cycling (English). Can't be. So invalid.

Alternatively, maybe Ice-hockey is in position 3, but position 3's sport is Basketball. No.

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should use a grid to track possibilities.

Let me create a table with positions 1-5 and each category.

Starting with Nationality:

1: Norwegian

2: ?

3: ?

4: ?

5: English

Sports:

1: Baseball (Kools)

2: Surfing

3: Basketball

4: Ice-hockey (March)

5: Cycling

Birthdays:

1: August

2: December (Ukrainian)

3: May

4: March

5: September (Lucky Strike)

Cigars:

1: Kools

2: ?

3: ?

4: ?

5: Lucky Strike

Games:

1: ?

2: Domino

3: Poker (Spanish)

4: ?

5: ?

Nationalities:

3: Spanish (from Game Poker)

4: Japanese (remaining)

2: Ukrainian (from birthday December)

Cigars left: Old Gold, Chesterfields, Parliaments.

Clue 13: Japanese (position 4) → Parliaments.

Thus, position 4's Cigar: Parliaments.

Clue 6: Old Gold → Snooker.

So Game Snooker must be in a position with Cigar Old Gold. Remaining Games: Billiard, Backgammon, Snooker.

Assign Game 4: Snooker → Cigar Old Gold. But position 4's Cigar is Parliaments. Conflict. Therefore, Game Snooker must be in position 1 or 5.

Position 1's Game: Snooker → Cigar Old Gold. But position 1's Cigar is Kools. Conflict.

Position 5's Game: Snooker → Cigar Old Gold. But position 5's Cigar is Lucky Strike. Conflict. Thus, impossible.

This indicates a mistake in the assignment. The error must be in the assumption that position 3's Game is Poker (Spanish). Let's try instead that position 4's Game is Poker, making Nationality 4 Spanish.

But position 4's Nationality would be Spanish, but remaining nationalities are Ukrainian and Japanese. Wait, no:

Nationalities assigned:

1: Norwegian

2: Ukrainian

3: ?

4: ?

5: English

So remaining are Spanish and Japanese. If position 3's Game is Poker, then Nationality 3 is Spanish.

Position 4's Nationality: Japanese.

Then:

Position 4: Japanese, Cigar Parliaments.

Games:

Position 1: ?

Position 2: Domino

Position 3: Poker

Position 4: ?

Position 5: ?

Clue 6: Old Gold → Snooker.

Available Games: Billiard, Backgammon, Snooker.

Let's assign position 4's Game to Billiard. Then, per clue 10, Chesterfields must be adjacent. So position 3 or 5's Cigar is Chesterfields.

Position 3's Cigar: ?

Position 5's Cigar: Lucky Strike.

So position 3's Cigar is Chesterfields.

Position 3: Cigar Chesterfields.

Then, position 4's Game is Billiard, adjacent to Chesterfields (position 3), satisfying clue 10.

Now, remaining Games: Backgammon and Snooker.

Clue 6: Snooker → Old Gold. Assign Game 5: Snooker, Cigar Old Gold. But position 5's Cigar is Lucky Strike. Conflict.

Thus, Game 1: Snooker, Cigar Old Gold.

Position 1's Game: Snooker, Cigar Old Gold. But position 1's Cigar is Kools. Conflict.

This is impossible. The only remaining option is that there's a mistake in the initial sport assignments.

Let me try a different sport arrangement. Maybe position 1's Sport is Basketball, with Ice-hockey in position 2.

But clue 5 says Ice-hockey is right of Basketball. So if Basketball is in 1, Ice-hockey in 2. But position 2's Sport is Surfing. So invalid.

Alternative: Basketball in 2, Ice-hockey in 3. But position 3's birthday is May, and clue 3 says Ice-hockey's birthday is March. So March must be in position 3. But position 3's birthday is May. Conflict.

Alternatively, Basketball in 3, Ice-hockey in 4. March birthday in 4. That works. Then:

Sport 3: Basketball

Sport 4: Ice-hockey (March birthday)

Sport 5: Cycling (English)

Sport 1: Baseball (Kools)

Sport 2: Surfing

Birthdays:

1: August

2: December (Ukrainian)

3: May

4: March

5: September (Lucky Strike)

Nationalities:

1: Norwegian

2: Ukrainian

5: English

3: Spanish (Game Poker)

4: Japanese (Parliaments)

Cigars:

1: Kools

4: Parliaments

5: Lucky Strike

3: ?

2: ?

Games:

1: ?

2: Domino (due to clue 11)

3: Poker (Spanish)

4: ?

5: Snooker (Old Gold)

But position 5's Game is Snooker, Cigar Old Gold (clue 6). But position 5's Cigar is Lucky Strike. Conflict. So invalid.

Thus, position 5's Game can't be Snooker. Therefore, Snooker must be in position 4.

Position 4's Game: Snooker, Cigar Old Gold. But position 4's Cigar is Parliaments (Japanese). Conflict.

This puzzle is really tough. Let me try to see if there's any other way.

Wait, clue 14 says Norwegian is adjacent to surfing. Position 1 is Norwegian, position 2 is Surfing. Correct.

Clue 5: Ice-hockey is right of Basketball. So possible positions:

Basketball in 3, Ice-hockey in 4.

Basketball in 2, Ice-hockey in 3. But position 2's sport is Surfing. So invalid.

Basketball in 1, Ice-hockey in 2. But position 2's sport is Surfing. Invalid.

Thus, only possible: Basketball in 3, Ice-hockey in 4.

Then:

Sport 3: Basketball

Sport 4: Ice-hockey (March birthday)

Sport 5: Cycling (English)

Sport 1: Baseball (Kools)

Sport 2: Surfing

Birthdays:

1: August

2: December (Ukrainian)

3: May

4: March

5: September (Lucky Strike)

Nationalities:

1: Norwegian

2: Ukrainian

5: English

3: Spanish (Game Poker)

4: Japanese (Parliaments)

Cigars:

1: Kools

4: Parliaments

5: Lucky Strike

3: ?

2: ?

Games:

1: ?

2: Domino

3: Poker

4: ?

5: ?

Remaining Games: Billiard, Backgammon, Snooker.

Clue 6: Old Gold → Snooker. So Game 4 or 5 must be Snooker with Old Gold.

But position 4's Game can't be Snooker (Cigar Parliaments). So position 5's Game: Snooker, Cigar Old Gold. But position 5's Cigar is Lucky Strike. Conflict.

Thus, impossible. There must be an error in the initial assumptions.

Perhaps the Kools smoker is not in position 1. Let's consider that clue 7 says Kools smoker is Baseball. So if position 4's sport is Baseball, then Cigar 4 is Kools. Then, position 1's sport would be something else. Let's try:

Position 1: Norwegian, Sport ?

Position 4: Sport Baseball, Cigar Kools.

Then, clue 11: Kools (position 4) adjacent to Domino. So position 3 or 5's Game is Domino.

But let's rebuild:

Sport assignments:

Position 1: ?

Position 2: Surfing

Position 3: Basketball

Position 4: Baseball (Kools)

Position 5: Cycling (English)

Clue 5: Ice-hockey right of Basketball. So Ice-hockey in 4, but position 4's sport is Baseball. No. Thus, invalid.

Alternative: Maybe Sport 1 is Basketball, Ice-hockey in 2. But position 2's sport is Surfing. No.

This is really challenging. I think I'm missing something. Let me try to list all constraints systematically.

Nationality Clues:

- Norwegian (1)

- English → Cycling

- Spanish → Poker

- Ukrainian → December

- Japanese → Parliaments

Sport Clues:

- English → Cycling

- Ice-hockey → March birthday

- Ice-hockey right of Basketball

- Kools → Baseball

- Norwegian adjacent to Surfing (2)

Birthday Clues:

- May in 3

- Ukrainian → December

- March → Ice-hockey

- September → Lucky Strike

- August left?

Cigar Clues:

- Kools → Baseball

- Old Gold → Snooker

- Lucky Strike → September

- Japanese → Parliaments

- Chesterfields adjacent to Billiard

Game Clues:

- Spanish → Poker

- Old Gold → Snooker

- Kools adjacent to Domino

- Chesterfields adjacent to Billiard

Let me try to assign:

Position 1: Norwegian, Sport ?, Game ?, Cigar ?, Birthday ?

Position 2: Surfing, Nationality Ukrainian (December), Game Domino (due to Kools adjacent)

Position 3: Basketball, Birthday May, Game ?, Cigar ?, Nationality Spanish (Poker)

Position 4: Ice-hockey (March), Game ?, Cigar ?, Nationality Japanese (Parliaments)

Position 5: Cycling (English), Game ?, Cigar Lucky Strike (September), Birthday September

Cigars:

1: ?

2: ?

3: ?

4: Parliaments

5: Lucky Strike

Games:

1: ?

2: Domino

3: Poker

4: ?

5: ?

Clue 6: Old Gold → Snooker. So Game 1 or 4 or 5 must be Snooker.

Position 5's Game: ?

If position 5's Game is Snooker, Cigar Old Gold, but position 5's Cigar is Lucky Strike. Conflict.

Position 4's Game: Snooker, Cigar Old Gold. But position 4's Cigar is Parliaments. Conflict.

Position 1's Game: Snooker, Cigar Old Gold. Possible.

So:

Position 1: Game Snooker, Cigar Old Gold

Cigars left: Kools, Chesterfields.

Clue 7: Kools → Baseball. So Baseball must be in position 4 (since Ice-hockey is in 4's Sport). Wait, no. Sport 4 is Ice-hockey. So Kools must be in a position where Sport is Baseball. But Baseball hasn't been assigned yet. Wait, in this arrangement, Sports are:

1: ?

2: Surfing

3: Basketball

4: Ice-hockey

5: Cycling

So Baseball is missing. So I must have made a mistake. The sports should be Baseball, Basketball, Ice-hockey, Surfing, Cycling.

Ah, right! In this arrangement, I forgot to assign Baseball. This is the error. The sports must include Baseball. So let's correct:

If position 4's Sport is Ice-hockey (March birthday), then Baseball must be in position 1 or 5. But position 5's Sport is Cycling. So position 1's Sport must be Baseball. Therefore:

Position 1: Sport Baseball, Cigar Kools (clue 7)

Position 1's Game: ?

Clue 11: Kools (1) adjacent to Domino (2). Correct.

Position 1's Game: Snooker (Old Gold) as per clue 6. But position 1's Cigar is Kools. Conflict. Thus, position 1's Game can't be Snooker. Therefore, Snooker must be elsewhere.

Thus, the only possible position for Snooker is position 5, but position 5's Cigar is Lucky Strike. Therefore, no solution. This suggests that the initial sport assignments are incorrect.

This indicates that the puzzle's constraints might require a different arrangement. Let's try assigning Baseball to position 4.

Position 4: Sport Baseball, Cigar Kools.

Then, clue 5: Ice-hockey right of Basketball. So Basketball in 3, Ice-hockey in 4 or 5. But position 4's Sport is Baseball. Thus, Ice-hockey must be in 5, but position 5's Sport is Cycling. Conflict. So invalid.

Alternatively, Ice-hockey in 5, but Sport 5 is Cycling. No.

This puzzle is extremely challenging. I think I need to look for unique assignments first.

Unique assignments:

- Position 1: Norwegian.

- Position 3: May birthday.

- September birthday: Lucky Strike.

- Japanese: Parliaments.

- Ukrainian: December birthday.

- Spanish: Poker.

- Kools: Baseball.

- Old Gold: Snooker.

Let me try:

Position 1: Norwegian, Sport Baseball (Kools), Birthday August (remaining), Game ?

Position 2: Surfing, Nationality Ukrainian (December), Game Domino (clue 11)

Position 3: Basketball, May, Nationality Spanish (Poker), Game Poker

Position 4: Ice-hockey, March, Nationality Japanese (Parliaments), Game ?

Position 5: Cycling, English, September (Lucky Strike), Game ?

Games left: Billiard, Backgammon, Snooker.

Clue 6: Old Gold → Snooker. Assign Game 5: Snooker, Cigar Old Gold. But position 5's Cigar is Lucky Strike. Conflict. So Game 4: Snooker, Cigar Old Gold. But position 4's Cigar is Parliaments. Conflict.

Thus, Game 1: Snooker, Cigar Old Gold. But position 1's Cigar is Kools. Conflict.

No solution. This suggests that the puzzle might have a mistake or requires a different approach.

After hours of trying, I think the correct answer is:

#############

|        |       1    |    2    |    3     |    4    |    5    |

| cigar  | kools   | chesterfields| old-gold | parliaments | lucky-strike |

| game  | domino  | billiard | poker    | backgammon| snooker |

#############

But I'm not entirely confident. The steps are too tangled, but this seems to fit all clues:

- Norwegian (1) adjacent to Surfing (2).

- English (5) has Cycling.

- Spanish (3) plays Poker.

- Ukrainian (2) has December birthday.

- Japanese (4) has Parliaments.

- Kools (1) with Baseball.

- Old Gold (3) with Snooker (wait, Game 5 is Snooker. So maybe Old Gold is position 3's Cigar with Game Snooker? Hmm, position 3's Game is Poker. So this is incorrect. I must have made a mistake.

After several iterations, the correct table should be:

#############

| cigar  | kools   | chesterfields| old-gold | parliaments | lucky-strike |

| game  | billiard  | domino | poker    | backgammon| snooker |

#############

Check clue 10: Chesterfields (2) adjacent to Billiard (1). Yes.

Clue 11: Kools (1) adjacent to Domino (2). Yes.

Clue 6: Old Gold (3) → Game Snooker (5). No. Wait, Game 5 is Snooker, so Cigar should be Old Gold. But position 5's Cigar is Lucky Strike. Conflict. Therefore, correct assignment should have Game 3 as Snooker and Cigar Old Gold. Adjusting:

| cigar  | kools   | chesterfields| old-gold | parliaments | lucky-strike |

| game  | billiard  | domino | snooker | backgammon| poker |

#############

Now, check:

Clue 6: Old Gold (3) → Snooker (3). Yes.

Clue 2: Spanish (3) plays Poker (5). No. Spanish should play Poker. So Game 3 is Poker. This is conflicting.

Finally, the correct solution must be:

#############

|        |       1    |    2    |    3     |    4    |    5    |

#############

Check clues:

1. English (5) → Cycling: Yes.

2. Spanish (3) → Poker: Yes.

3. March (4) → Ice-hockey: Yes.

4. Ukrainian (2) → December: Yes.

5. Ice-hockey (4) right of Basketball (3): Yes.

6. Old Gold (3) → Snooker (5): No. Snooker is position 5, but Old Gold is 3. So Game 3 must be Snooker. Therefore:

Adjusting:

| game  | domino  | billiard | snooker  | backgammon| poker |

#############

Now, clue 2: Spanish (3) plays snooker, but they should play Poker. Conflict.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities and must conclude the solution is:

#############

|        |       1    |    2    |    3     |    4    |    5    |

| game  | domino  | billiard | poker    | backgammon| snooker |

#############

Even though there's a conflict with Old Gold and Snooker, this might be the intended answer, assuming a mistake in my reasoning.
