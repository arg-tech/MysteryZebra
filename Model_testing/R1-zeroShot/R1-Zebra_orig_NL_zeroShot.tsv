R1-Zebra-orig_NL-1	"Okay, let's tackle this logic puzzle. Hmm, there are five houses in a row, each with different attributes: nationality, color, beverage, cigar, and pet. I need to figure out which combination goes where based on the 14 clues provided. Let me start by listing out all the clues and see how they connect.

First, let's note the categories:

- Nationalities: English, Spanish, Ukrainian, Norwegian, Japanese

- Colors: Red, Green, Ivory, Yellow, Blue

- Beverages: Coffee, Tea, Milk, Orange-juice, Water

- Cigars: Old-gold, Kools, Chesterfield, Lucky-strike, Parliament

- Pets: Dog, Fox, Zebra, Horse, Snails

Clues:

1. English likes red.

2. Spanish owns the dog.

3. Coffee drinker likes green.

4. Ukrainian drinks tea.

5. Green is to the right of ivory.

6. Old-gold smoker has snails.

7. Kools smoker likes yellow.

8. Milk is in the middle (house 3).

9. Norwegian is on the far left (house 1).

10. Chesterfield smoker is adjacent to fox owner.

11. Kools smoker is adjacent to horse owner.

12. Lucky-strike smoker drinks orange-juice.

13. Japanese smokes Parliament.

14. Norwegian is adjacent to blue.

Alright, let's start with the fixed positions first. Clue 9 says Norwegian is in house 1. Clue 8 says milk is in house 3. So house 3's beverage is milk.

Clue 14 says Norwegian (house 1) is adjacent to blue. So house 2 must be blue because house 1 is Norwegian, and adjacent is house 2. So house 2's color is blue. Wait, unless there's another possibility, but since Norwegian is in 1, the only adjacent is 2. So blue is house 2.

Clue 5: Green is to the right of ivory. So Ivory must come before Green. So Ivory is in some house n and Green in n+1. Since there are 5 houses, possible pairs are (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5). But since Norwegian is in 1 and blue is in 2, then house 2 is blue. So Ivory can't be in house 2. If Ivory is in 3, then Green is in 4. Or Ivory in 4, Green in 5. But let's see.

Clue 1: English likes red. So the English person's color is red. Clue 3: Coffee drinker likes green. So wherever green is, that's the coffee drinker. And clue 5: green is right of ivory.

Clue 4: Ukrainian drinks tea. So Ukrainian's beverage is tea.

Clue 7: Kools smoker likes yellow. So Kools and yellow go together.

Clue 12: Lucky-strike is orange-juice.

Clue 13: Japanese smokes Parliament.

Clue 6: Old-gold smoker has snails.

Clue 2: Spanish has dog.

Clue 10: Chesterfield next to fox.

Clue 11: Kools next to horse.

Let me start building the table step by step.

House 1: Norwegian (clue 9). Adjacent to blue (clue14), so house 2 is blue. So house 1's color? The colors left are red, green, ivory, yellow. But clue 1 says English is red. Since Norwegian is in house 1, they can't be English. So the English person must be in another house. House 2 is blue, so house 1's color must be... possible colors: red, green, ivory, yellow. But house 2 is blue. Wait, the colors are red, green, ivory, yellow, blue. So all five. So house 1's color is one of the remaining: red, green, ivory, yellow. But since house 2 is blue, and clue5 says green is to the right of ivory. Let's see if house1 could be ivory. If house1 is ivory, then house2 would be green. But house2 is blue. So no. So maybe ivory is in house3, green in 4. Or house4 ivory, green 5.

Wait, house2 is blue, so the possible ivory-green pairs are (house3-4) or (4-5). Let's check that.

Clue3: Coffee drinker is green. So whoever is in green's house drinks coffee. Clue1: English is red. So the English person's house is red. Let's see where red can be. If red is house3, then English is there. But house3's beverage is milk. So English in house3 would have milk. But maybe that's okay. Let's see.

Let me try to assign the colors considering clue5. Let's suppose ivory is in house3, so green in 4. Then coffee would be in house4. House3 is ivory. But house3's beverage is milk. So house4 would be green with coffee. House5 would be the remaining color, which would be yellow? Wait, no. Colors are red, green, ivory, yellow, blue. Blue is house2. So if house3 is ivory, house4 green, then house5 must be red or yellow. Wait, red is for English. Let's see.

If house1's color is yellow, then Kools smoker is there (clue7). But house1 is Norwegian. So Kools would be Norwegian's cigar. Then the Kools smoker is in house1 (yellow). Then clue11 says Kools smoker is adjacent to horse owner. So house2 would have horse. But house2's color is blue, and nationality is... let's see. Nationalities: Norwegian (1), Spanish, Ukrainian, English, Japanese. So house1 is Norwegian. Let's see, Spanish has the dog (clue2). So Spanish must be in a house with dog. Ukrainian drinks tea (clue4), so their beverage is tea. Japanese smokes Parliament (clue13).

Let me try to assign the colors again. Let's consider possible positions for ivory and green.

Option1: Ivory in house3, green in4.

Then house4 is green, so coffee is there (clue3). So house4's beverage is coffee. House3's beverage is milk (clue8). House5's color would be red or yellow. But house1's color can't be green (since green is in4) or blue (house2). So house1's possible colors: red, yellow, ivory. But ivory is in3. So house1's color must be red or yellow. But English is red (clue1), so if house1 is red, then English would be there, but house1 is Norwegian. So that's impossible. Therefore, house1 can't be red. So house1 must be yellow. Then Kools is in house1 (clue7). So Norwegian (house1) smokes Kools and has yellow. Then clue11 says Kools smoker is adjacent to horse owner. So house2 has horse. House2's color is blue. So nationality of house2? Let's see, house2's nationality could be Ukrainian (since Ukrainian drinks tea). Let's check. If house2 is Ukrainian, then their beverage is tea (clue4). But house3's beverage is milk, house4's is coffee, house5's would be orange-juice or water. Then maybe house5 is orange-juice (Lucky-strike, clue12). Let's see.

But let's try to assign nationalities. House1: Norwegian, yellow, Kools. House2: Blue, and maybe Ukrainian. So Ukrainian drinks tea (clue4), so house2's beverage would be tea. But house2's nationality would be Ukrainian. Then house3 is ivory, beverage milk. So nationality? House3's nationality could be English (if color is red, but house3 is ivory. Wait, English must be in red (clue1). So English must be in a red-colored house. So where is red? If house5's color is red, then English is there. Let's see: colors so far:

House1: yellow

House2: blue

House3: ivory

House4: green

House5: red

So house5 is red, so English is in house5. Then house5's nationality is English. Then the nationalities are:

1: Norwegian

2: ?

3: ?

4: ?

5: English

Remaining nationalities: Spanish, Ukrainian, Japanese. House2: blue, beverage tea (if Ukrainian), so if house2 is Ukrainian, then they drink tea. Then house2's beverage is tea. Then beverages:

1: ?

2: tea

3: milk

4: coffee

5: ?

Left beverages: water and orange-juice. Clue12: Lucky-strike is orange-juice. So someone has Lucky-strike and orange-juice. That would be in house5 maybe. Let's see. House5 is English, so their beverage? If house5's beverage is orange-juice, then they smoke Lucky-strike (clue12). Also, clue13: Japanese smokes Parliament. So Japanese must be in a house with Parliament. So house5 can't be Japanese. So Japanese must be in house4 or 3 or 2. Let's check.

If house5 is English (red), then their beverage could be water or orange-juice. If they have orange-juice, then they smoke Lucky-strike. Then house5's cigar is Lucky-strike. But then the Spanish must be in another house. House2 is Ukrainian, house3 maybe Spanish? Because Spanish owns the dog (clue2). So if house3 is Spanish, their pet is dog. Then house3's nationality is Spanish, color ivory, beverage milk. Then their pet is dog. Then house2's pet would be... Wait, house2's pet is not mentioned yet. But house2 has horse (from clue11: Kools in 1 is adjacent to horse in 2). So house2's pet is horse. Then house2: Ukrainian, blue, tea, horse. Wait, but clue11 says Kools smoker (house1) is adjacent to horse owner (house2). That fits. Then house3: Spanish, ivory, milk, dog. Then house4: green, coffee. Nationality? Remaining are Ukrainian (house2), Norwegian (1), English (5), Spanish (3). So house4's nationality is Japanese. So Japanese in house4, color green, beverage coffee. Then their cigar would be Parliament (clue13), so house4's cigar is Parliament. Then house5: English, red. Beverage? The remaining beverages are water and orange-juice. If house5's beverage is orange-juice, then they smoke Lucky-strike (clue12). Then their cigar is Lucky-strike. But then remaining cigars are Chesterfield and Old-gold. Let's check.

Cigars: Kools (1), Parliament (4), Lucky-strike (5). Remaining: Old-gold, Chesterfield. So house2 and 3 need to have Old-gold and Chesterfield. Clue6: Old-gold smoker has snails. So whoever smokes Old-gold has snails as pet. Clue10: Chesterfield smoker is adjacent to fox owner. Let's see.

House3: Spanish, dog. So their pet is dog. So Spanish in 3, dog. House2: horse. House1: Norwegian, what's their pet? Not sure yet. House4: Japanese, Parliament, pet? House5: English, pet?

House4: Japanese, Parliament. Their pet? The remaining pets are fox, zebra, snails. Since clue6 says Old-gold smoker has snails. So Old-gold must be in a house with snails. Let's see. If house3's cigar is Chesterfield, then house2's would be Old-gold. House2 is Ukrainian, blue, tea, horse, Old-gold. Then their pet would be snails. But house2's pet is horse. So that's a conflict. So can't be. So maybe house3 smokes Old-gold. Then house3: Spanish, Old-gold, pet snails. But house3's pet is dog (clue2 says Spanish has dog). So conflict. Therefore, house3 can't smoke Old-gold. So house3 must smoke Chesterfield. Then house3: Chesterfield. Then house2's cigar is Old-gold. So house2: Old-gold, which would have snails (clue6). But house2's pet is horse. So conflict again. Hmm.

This suggests a problem. Let's backtrack. Maybe the color assignments are different. Let me check again.

Alternative approach: Let's try house1: Norwegian. House2: blue (clue14). House1's color must be yellow, red, ivory, or green. Clue5: ivory before green. So if house1 is yellow (Kools), then clue7 applies. Let's try that again.

House1: Norwegian, yellow, Kools. Then adjacent to horse (house2). So house2's pet is horse. House2's color is blue. Then house2's nationality: maybe Ukrainian (since clue4 says Ukrainian drinks tea). So house2: Ukrainian, blue, beverage tea, cigar ?, pet horse. Then house3: milk (clue8). House3's color? ivory. Then house4: green, coffee (clue3). House5: red (English). So:

House1: Norwegian, yellow, Kools, beverage?, pet?

House2: Ukrainian, blue, tea, ?, horse.

House3: ?, ivory, milk, ?, ?

House4: ?, green, coffee, ?, ?

House5: English, red, ?, ?, ?

Now, nationalities: Norwegian (1), Ukrainian (2), English (5). Remaining: Spanish, Japanese. So house3 and 4 must be Spanish and Japanese. Clue2: Spanish has dog. So if house3 is Spanish, then their pet is dog. Then house4 is Japanese, who smokes Parliament (clue13). So house4: Japanese, green, coffee, Parliament, pet? Remaining pets: fox, zebra, snails. Clue6: Old-gold smoker has snails. Clue10: Chesterfield adjacent to fox. Clue12: Lucky-strike and orange-juice.

Let's assign beverages. House3's beverage is milk. House2's is tea, house4's is coffee. House5's beverage: remaining are water and orange-juice. If house5 drinks orange-juice, they smoke Lucky-strike (clue12). So house5: Lucky-strike, orange-juice. Then remaining beverages: water in house1.

So house1's beverage is water. So Norwegian (1) drinks water. Then:

House1: water, Kools, pet? Let's see. Pets: dog (Spanish in 3), horse (2), remaining: fox, zebra, snails. House1's pet? Not sure yet.

House3: Spanish, ivory, milk, dog. So their cigar? Cigars available: Old-gold, Chesterfield, Parliament (but house4 has Parliament). So house3's cigar is either Old-gold or Chesterfield. If house3 smokes Old-gold, then their pet is snails (clue6). But house3's pet is dog. So conflict. So house3 must smoke Chesterfield. Then house3: Chesterfield. Then clue10 says Chesterfield is adjacent to fox. So house3's adjacent houses are 2 and 4. House2's pet is horse, so house4's pet must be fox. So house4: Japanese, green, coffee, Parliament, pet fox. Then house4's pet is fox. Then remaining pets: snails and zebra. House5's pet would be zebra, and house1's pet is snails? Wait, but clue6 says Old-gold smoker has snails. So if someone smokes Old-gold, they have snails. So if house5's cigar is Lucky-strike, then remaining cigars are Old-gold and Parliament. But house4 has Parliament, so house2's cigar would be Old-gold. House2: Ukrainian, blue, tea, Old-gold, horse. Then their pet is horse, but Old-gold smoker should have snails. Conflict. So house2 can't be Old-gold. Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, cigars so far:

House1: Kools

House3: Chesterfield

House4: Parliament

House5: Lucky-strike

Remaining: Old-gold. So house2 must smoke Old-gold. So house2: Old-gold. Then according to clue6, Old-gold smoker has snails. But house2's pet is horse. So conflict. That's a problem. So maybe our initial assumption is wrong. Let's see where we went wrong.

Alternative approach: Maybe the colors are assigned differently. Let's try another possibility for ivory and green.

Suppose ivory is in house4, green in5. Then clue5 is satisfied. So house4: ivory, house5: green. But house5's color would be green, so coffee is there (clue3). But house3's beverage is milk. Then house5's beverage is coffee. But that's possible. However, house5 is green, coffee. Then English is in red. Where is red? Let's see. Colors would be:

House1: ?

House2: blue

House3: ?

House4: ivory

House5: green

So remaining colors for houses1 and3: red and yellow. House1's nationality is Norwegian. Clue1: English is red. So English must be in house1 or 3. If house1 is red, then English is there, but Norwegian is in house1. Conflict. So house3 must be red, and English is there. Then house3: English, red, beverage milk. But clue3 says coffee is in green (house5). So house3's beverage is milk. Then house5's beverage is coffee. That works. Then:

House1: Norwegian, color? Either yellow or ivory. But ivory is in house4. So house1's color could be yellow. Then Kools smoker is in house1 (clue7). So house1: Kools, yellow, Norwegian. Then clue11 says Kools adjacent to horse. So house2 has horse. House2 is blue, nationality? Let's see. Nationalities: Norwegian (1), English (3), so remaining: Spanish, Ukrainian, Japanese. House2's nationality could be Ukrainian (since they drink tea). So house2: Ukrainian, blue, tea, pet horse. Then house3: English, red, milk. Their cigar? Cigars left: Old-gold, Chesterfield, Parliament, Lucky-strike. Let's see. Clue12: Lucky-strike is orange-juice. So if someone drinks orange-juice, they smoke Lucky-strike. The remaining beverages after milk (3), tea (2), coffee (5) are water and orange-juice. So house4 and 1. House1's beverage: maybe water. House4's beverage: orange-juice. Then house4: orange-juice, Lucky-strike. So house4's cigar is Lucky-strike. Then house5: coffee, green. Their nationality? Japanese, since remaining are Spanish and Japanese. Clue13: Japanese smoke Parliament. So house5's cigar is Parliament. But house5's beverage is coffee, which is correct because clue3 says green house (5) drinks coffee. Then:

House5: Japanese, green, coffee, Parliament, pet?

House4: ivory, orange-juice, Lucky-strike, nationality? Spanish? Because clue2 says Spanish has dog. So house4's nationality is Spanish. Then house4: Spanish, ivory, orange-juice, Lucky-strike, pet dog. But clue2 says Spanish has dog. That fits. Then house4's pet is dog. Then remaining pets: fox, zebra, snails. House1's pet? Let's see. House1: Norwegian, yellow, Kools, beverage water. So their pet? The remaining pets are fox, zebra, snails. Clue6: Old-gold smoker has snails. So if someone smokes Old-gold, they have snails. Let's see which house smokes Old-gold. The cigars used so far: Kools (1), Lucky-strike (4), Parliament (5). Remaining: Old-gold and Chesterfield. House2 and 3 need these. House2: Ukrainian, blue, tea, horse. Their cigar: Chesterfield or Old-gold. House3: English, red, milk. Their cigar: remaining one. Let's suppose house2 smokes Chesterfield. Then house3 smokes Old-gold. So house3: Old-gold. Then their pet is snails (clue6). But house3's nationality is English, who is supposed to be in red (which is correct), and their pet would be snails. Then remaining pets: house5 has zebra or fox. House5's pet: since Japanese is in 5, and the pets left are fox and zebra. Then house5's pet could be zebra (as the puzzle often ends with zebra). Then house1's pet would be fox. But let's check clue10: Chesterfield smoker is adjacent to fox. House2 smokes Chesterfield (if we assigned that), so house2's adjacent houses are 1 and3. House1's pet is fox. So house1: fox. Then house2's Chesterfield is adjacent to fox (house1). That fits clue10. Then house3's pet is snails. House5's pet is zebra. Then house4's pet is dog. That leaves house2's pet as horse (already assigned). So this seems to work.

Let me check all clues:

1. English in house3 (red) ✔️

2. Spanish in house4 (dog) ✔️

3. Coffee in house5 (green) ✔️

4. Ukrainian in house2 (tea) ✔️

5. Green (5) right of ivory (4) ✔️

6. Old-gold in house3 (snails) ✔️

7. Kools in house1 (yellow) ✔️

8. Milk in house3 ✔️

9. Norwegian in house1 ✔️

10. Chesterfield in house2 adjacent to fox (house1) ✔️

11. Kools in house1 adjacent to horse (house2) ✔️

12. Lucky-strike in house4 (orange-juice) ✔️

13. Japanese in house5 (Parliament) ✔️

14. Norwegian (1) next to blue (2) ✔️

And pets:

House1: fox

House2: horse

House3: snails

House4: dog

House5: zebra

Yes, this seems to fit all clues. Let's verify once more.

Nationalities:

1: Norwegian

2: Ukrainian

3: English

4: Spanish

5: Japanese

Colors:

1: yellow

2: blue

This table satisfies all the given clues. Let me know if you have further questions!"
R1-Zebra-orig_NL-3	"Okay, let's tackle this logic puzzle. It's a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step. First, I'll list out all the clues and see how they can fit together.

Starting with the nationalities: English, Spanish, Ukrainian, Norwegian, Japanese. Clue 9 says the Norwegian is on the far left, so House 1's nationality is Norwegian. Clue 14 adds that the Norwegian is next to someone who likes blue. Since Norwegian is in House 1, House 2 must be blue.

Next, the colors: red, green, ivory, yellow, blue. Clue 5 states that green is to the right of ivory, so ivory must be immediately before green. Given that House 2 is blue, we need to place ivory and green. If House 3 is ivory, then House 4 would be green. But House 3 is the middle, and clue 8 says milk is in the middle (House 3). Let's hold that thought.

Clue 1 says the English person likes red. So wherever English is, that house is red. Clue 7 mentions the Kools-smoker likes yellow. Let's note that Kools and yellow are linked.

Clue 3: Coffee drinker likes green. So the house with green (House 4 if ivory is 3) would have coffee. Clue 4: Ukrainian drinks tea. So Ukrainian must be in a house where tea is the beverage.

Clue 12: Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice. Clue 13: Japanese smokes Parliament. Clue 6: Old Gold smoker owns snails. Clue 2: Spanish owns the dog. Clue 10: Chesterfield smoker is adjacent to fox owner. Clue 11: Kools smoker is adjacent to horse owner.

Let's start filling in what's known:

House 1: Norwegian, color? (since House 2 is blue). Clue 7 says Kools is yellow. If Norwegian is in House 1, maybe House 1 is yellow, making Kools in House 1. Then House 1's color is yellow, cigar is Kools.

Now, House 2 is blue. The colors left are red, green, ivory. Since green must be right of ivory, maybe House 3 is ivory, House 4 green, House 5 red. That fits because English (clue 1) would be in House 5 (red). So House 5: English, red. Beverage? Clue 3 says coffee is with green (House 4), so House 4 drinks coffee. Then House 5's beverage? The remaining ones are water, orange juice. Clue 12 says Lucky Strike is orange juice. Maybe House 5 has orange juice and Lucky Strike, but wait, Japanese smokes Parliament (clue 13), so House 5 would be Japanese? Wait, House 5 is English according to clue 1. Contradiction. Hmm.

Wait, I made a mistake. If House 5 is red and English, then Japanese must be in another house. Let me backtrack.

Colors: House 1 (Norwegian) is yellow (Kools), House 2 blue. House 3 ivory, House 4 green, House 5 red. So House 5 is English (clue 1), nationality English. Beverages: House 3 has milk (clue 8). House 4 (green) has coffee (clue 3). Then beverages left are tea, water, orange juice. Ukrainian drinks tea (clue 4), so Ukrainian must be in a house with tea. Possible in House 2 (blue), so House 2's nationality is Ukrainian, beverage tea. Then beverages left for House 1: water, House 5: orange juice. Clue 12 says Lucky Strike is orange juice, so House 5's cigar is Lucky Strike. But clue 13 says Japanese smokes Parliament, so House 5 can't be Japanese if it's English. Therefore, House 5 is English (red, orange juice, Lucky Strike), but Japanese must be in another house. The remaining nationality is Spanish and Japanese. Spanish owns the dog (clue 2). Let's see: House 4 is green, coffee, so nationality? House 4's nationality could be Spanish (since they own the dog). Then House 5's nationality is Japanese, but wait, House 5 was supposed to be English. Wait, conflict here.

Wait, let's correct. Nationalities: Norwegian (1), Ukrainian (2), English (5), then Spanish and Japanese left for Houses 3 and 4. House 3 has ivory, beverage milk. House 4 has green, coffee. Clue 2 says Spanish owns the dog. So Spanish must be in a house, and their pet is dog. Let's assign House 4 as Spanish (since House 4 is green, coffee). Then House 4's pet is dog. Then House 5's nationality would be Japanese. Then House 5's cigar is Parliament (clue 13). So House 5: Japanese, Parliament, beverage? If House 5's beverage is orange juice (from clue 12), but clue 12 says Lucky Strike is orange juice. So House 5 can't have orange juice if they smoke Parliament. Therefore, maybe House 4 has Lucky Strike and orange juice. Let's adjust: House 4's cigar is Lucky Strike (orange juice), so House 4's beverage is orange juice. But House 4 was supposed to have coffee (clue 3). Contradiction again. Hmm.

This is confusing. Let's try again step by step.

House 1: Norwegian, yellow, Kools, beverage? Remaining beverages: water, tea, milk, coffee, orange juice. House 3 has milk. So House 1's beverage could be water. Then House 2: Ukrainian, blue, tea. House 3: ivory, milk. House 4: green, coffee. House 5: red, English. Beverage for House 5: orange juice (since coffee is in 4, tea in 2, milk in 3, water in 1). So House 5: orange juice, which means Lucky Strike (clue 12). Then House 5's cigar is Lucky Strike. But clue 13 says Japanese smokes Parliament. So House 5's nationality is English, so Japanese must be in another house. The remaining nationalities are Spanish and Japanese. House 4's nationality could be Spanish (since clue 2 says Spanish owns the dog). So House 4: Spanish, green, coffee, dog. Then House 5: English, red, orange juice, Lucky Strike. Then House 3's nationality is Japanese? No, because House 5 is English, and House 1 is Norwegian, House 2 Ukrainian. So remaining are Spanish (House 4) and Japanese (House 5). Wait, House 5 is English, so Japanese must be in House 5. But that's a conflict. So maybe I messed up nationalities.

Wait, nationalities are Norwegian (1), Ukrainian (2), English (5), Spanish (4), and Japanese (5)? No, House 5 can't have two nationalities. Let me list nationalities again:

Available nationalities: English, Spanish, Ukrainian, Norwegian, Japanese.

Assigned so far: House 1: Norwegian, House 2: Ukrainian, House 5: English. Remaining: Spanish and Japanese for Houses 3 and 4.

House 4's nationality is Spanish (owns dog, clue 2). So House 4: Spanish, green, coffee, dog. Then House 5: English, red, orange juice, Lucky Strike. Then House 3's nationality is Japanese. But clue 13 says Japanese smoke Parliament. So House 3: Japanese, Parliament. But House 3's beverage is milk, which is fine. Then House 5's cigar is Lucky Strike (clue 12), which matches orange juice.

Now, cigars: House 1: Kools, House 2: ?, House 3: Parliament, House 4: ?, House 5: Lucky Strike. Remaining cigars: Chesterfield and Old Gold. Clue 6: Old Gold smoker owns snails. So Old Gold must be in a house with snails. Let's see. House 3: Japanese, Parliament, so not Old Gold. House 4: Spanish, dog. House 2: Ukrainian, tea. So House 2's cigar could be Chesterfield or Old Gold. If House 2 is Chesterfield, then House 4 would be Old Gold. But clue 6 says Old Gold has snails. House 4 has dog, so Old Gold can't be there. Therefore, House 3: ivory, milk, Japanese, Parliament – not Old Gold. House 2: Ukrainian, blue, tea, cigar? If House 2 is Chesterfield, then House 3 can't be Old Gold. Wait, remaining cigars are Chesterfield and Old Gold. If House 4's cigar is Old Gold, then House 4 has snails (clue 6), but House 4 has dog. Contradiction. Therefore, House 3 must have Old Gold and snails. House 3: Old Gold, snails. Then House 3's nationality is Japanese? But clue 13 says Japanese smoke Parliament. Conflict here. So maybe House 3 can't be Japanese. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in nationality assignments.

Let me start over:

House 1: Norwegian, yellow, Kools, water.

House 2: Ukrainian, blue, tea, Chesterfield (since clue 10 says Chesterfield is next to fox owner. If House 2 is Chesterfield, then House 1 or 3 has fox).

House 3: ivory, milk, Old Gold, snails (clue 6).

House 4: green, coffee, Spanish, dog (clue 2).

House 5: red, English, orange juice, Lucky Strike (clue 12), Japanese Parliament (clue 13). Wait, House 5's nationality is English (clue 1), so Japanese must be in House 5? No, conflict. Therefore, Japanese must be in House 5, but English is in House 5. This is impossible. Therefore, my arrangement is wrong.

Alternative approach: Maybe House 5 is Japanese, Parliament (clue 13), and English is elsewhere. But clue 1 says English likes red, so red must be in House 5. So House 5: red, English. But Japanese must be in House 5 for Parliament. Contradiction. Therefore, there's an error in my previous steps.

Let me check clue 13 again: Japanese is Parliament-smoker. So wherever Japanese is, they smoke Parliament. House 5 is red (English), so Japanese must be in another house. Let's assign House 5: English, red, orange juice, Lucky Strike. Then Japanese must be in House 4 or 3. House 4 is green, coffee, Spanish, dog. So House 4: Spanish, can't be Japanese. House 3: ivory, milk, nationality Japanese? Then House 3: Japanese, Parliament (clue 13). But House 3's beverage is milk, which is allowed. Then House 3: Japanese, ivory, milk, Parliament, pet? Old Gold smoker has snails (clue 6). So if House 3 smokes Parliament, then Old Gold must be elsewhere. Let's see remaining cigars: Old Gold, Chesterfield. House 1: Kools. House 2: Ukrainian, blue, tea. So House 2's cigar could be Chesterfield or Old Gold. If House 2 smokes Chesterfield, then House 1 or 3 has fox (clue 10). House 3 is Japanese with Parliament, so fox must be in House 1 or 3. House 1's pet? Not sure yet. House 2's pet? If House 2 smokes Chesterfield, adjacent to fox. If House 1 has fox, that works. So House 1: Norwegian, yellow, Kools, water, fox. Then House 2: Ukrainian, blue, tea, Chesterfield. Then clue 10 is satisfied.

Now, House 3: Japanese, ivory, milk, Parliament, snails? No, clue 6 says Old Gold smoker has snails. So House 3 can't have snails if they smoke Parliament. Therefore, House 3's pet must be something else. The remaining pets are zebra and horse. Wait, pets are dog, fox, zebra, horse, snails. House 4 has dog (Spanish). House 1 has fox. House 3 has snails (if Old Gold), but House 3 smokes Parliament. Therefore, Old Gold must be in another house. Let's assign House 3: ivory, milk, nationality Japanese, cigar Old Gold, pet snails. But clue 13 says Japanese smoke Parliament. Conflict. So House 3 can't be Old Gold. Therefore, Old Gold must be in House 4 or 5. House 4: Spanish, green, coffee, dog. If House 4 smokes Old Gold, then they have snails, but they have dog. Conflict. So House 5: English, red, orange juice, Lucky Strike. Can't be Old Gold. So the only remaining house is House 3. But House 3 must smoke Parliament if Japanese. This is a contradiction. Therefore, my earlier assumption is wrong.

Alternative: Maybe House 3 is not Japanese. Let's try assigning Japanese to House 5. House 5: Japanese, Parliament, red (but clue 1 says English likes red). Conflict. So House 5 must be English (red) and Japanese elsewhere. Let's try House 5: English, red, orange juice, Lucky Strike. House 4: Spanish, green, coffee, dog. House 3: ivory, milk, nationality Ukrainian? No, Ukrainian is in House 2. House 3's nationality must be Japanese. So House 3: Japanese, ivory, milk, Parliament, pet snails (clue 6 requires Old Gold for snails). Conflict again.

This is getting too tangled. Let's try another approach. Let's list all the constraints and see where they overlap.

Clue 5: Green is immediately to the right of ivory. So possible color orders could be:

- Ivory, Green, ..., ..., ... (but since there are 5 houses, it could be House 3-4, 4-5, etc.)

But since House 2 is blue (from clue 14), and House 1 is Norwegian (yellow, Kools), the colors might be:

1: yellow

2: blue

3: ivory

4: green

5: red

This fits clue 5 (ivory 3, green 4), and clue 1 (English in 5, red).

Then beverages:

3: milk (clue 8)

4: coffee (clue 3, green)

5: orange juice (Lucky Strike, clue 12)

2: tea (Ukrainian, clue 4)

1: water

Nationalities:

1: Norwegian

2: Ukrainian

5: English

3 and 4: Spanish and Japanese

Clue 2: Spanish owns dog. So House 4 is Spanish, dog. Then House 3 is Japanese, Parliament (clue 13). House 3: Japanese, ivory, milk, Parliament, pet? Clue 6: Old Gold has snails. So if House 3 is Japanese, they can't have Old Gold. So Old Gold must be in House 4 or 5. House 4: Spanish, dog, so if they smoke Old Gold, they'd have snails, but they have dog. Conflict. House 5: English, red, orange juice, Lucky Strike. So Old Gold must be in House 3. But House 3 is Japanese and smokes Parliament. Contradiction. Therefore, this arrangement is invalid.

Alternative color arrangement: Maybe House 3 is green, House 4 ivory. No, clue 5 says green is right of ivory. So the only valid sequence is ivory then green. Therefore, colors must be as before.

So the problem is with the Japanese and Parliament. Let me check again. House 3 is ivory, milk. Nationality Japanese, but they need to smoke Parliament (clue 13). So House 3: Japanese, Parliament. Then Old Gold must be elsewhere. House 4: Spanish, dog, coffee, green. Cigar? Remaining cigars: Old Gold, Chesterfield. If House 4 smokes Old Gold, then they have snails, but they have dog. Conflict. Therefore, House 4 must smoke Chesterfield, and House 2 smokes Old Gold. Wait, House 2 is Ukrainian, tea. If House 2 smokes Old Gold, then they have snails (clue 6). So House 2: Ukrainian, blue, tea, Old Gold, snails. Then House 4: Spanish, green, coffee, Chesterfield, dog.

But clue 10 says Chesterfield smoker is next to fox owner. House 4 smokes Chesterfield, so fox must be in House 3 or 5. House 3's pet is unknown. If House 3 is Japanese, Parliament, ivory, milk, then pet could be horse or zebra. Let's see clue 11: Kools (House 1) is next to horse owner. House 1's neighbor is House 2, which has snails. So House 2 has snails, but clue 11 requires Kools (House 1) next to horse. So House 2 must have horse. But House 2 has snails. Conflict. Therefore, this arrangement is invalid.

Alternative: House 2 smokes Chesterfield, owns horse. Then clue 11: Kools (House 1) is next to horse (House 2). That works. Then House 2: Ukrainian, blue, tea, Chesterfield, horse. Then clue 10: Chesterfield (House 2) is next to fox owner. So fox must be in House 1 or 3. House 1's pet: fox. Then House 1: Norwegian, yellow, Kools, water, fox.

Now, House 3: ivory, milk. Nationality Japanese, Parliament (clue 13). So House 3: Japanese, ivory, milk, Parliament, pet? Remaining pets: zebra and snails. Clue 6: Old Gold smoker has snails. So Old Gold must be in House 4 or 5. House 4: Spanish, green, coffee. Cigar? Old Gold or Lucky Strike. House 5: English, red, orange juice, Lucky Strike (clue 12). So House 5's cigar is Lucky Strike. Then House 4's cigar is Old Gold, and their pet is snails. But House 4's pet is dog (clue 2). Conflict. Therefore, House 4 cannot have Old Gold. So Old Gold must be in House 5. House 5: English, red, orange juice, Old Gold. But clue 12 says Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice. Therefore, House 5 must have Lucky Strike. Contradiction.

This is really challenging. Let's try again:

House 1: Norwegian, yellow, Kools, water, fox (clue 10).

House 2: Ukrainian, blue, tea, Chesterfield, horse (clue 11).

House 3: ivory, milk, Old Gold, snails (clue 6). Nationality? Remaining are Japanese and Spanish. If House 3 is Japanese, they should smoke Parliament (clue 13), but they're smoking Old Gold. Conflict. So House 3 must be Spanish. But clue 2 says Spanish owns dog. So House 3: Spanish, dog. But House 3's pet is snails. Conflict. Therefore, House 3 cannot be Spanish. Therefore, House 3 must be Japanese, but then they can't smoke Old Gold. This is a dead end.

I think I need to adjust the cigars. Maybe House 3 smokes Parliament (Japanese), House 5 smokes Lucky Strike (orange juice), House 4 smokes Old Gold (snails), but House 4 has dog. No. Alternatively, House 4: Spanish, dog, smokes Old Gold (snails). Conflict.

Wait, maybe the colors are arranged differently. Maybe House 3 is green and House 4 is ivory? But clue 5 says green is to the right of ivory, so ivory must be first.

Another approach: Let's list all possible color arrangements that satisfy clue 5 and 14.

Clue 14: Norwegian (House 1) next to blue (House 2).

Clue 5: Green is right of ivory. So possible color orders:

Option 1:

1: yellow

2: blue

3: ivory

4: green

5: red

Option 2:

1: ivory

2: green

3: blue

4: yellow

5: red

But clue 14 requires House 2 to be blue. So Option 1 is the only valid one.

Thus, colors are as before. Now, let's assign nationalities:

House 1: Norwegian

House 2: Ukrainian (clue 4: drinks tea)

House 5: English (clue 1: red)

Remaining: Spanish and Japanese in Houses 3 and 4.

Clue 2: Spanish owns dog. So Spanish in House 4 (green), dog there. Then House 4: Spanish, green, coffee (clue 3), dog. Cigar? Available cigars: Old Gold, Chesterfield, Lucky Strike, Parliament. House 5: Lucky Strike (orange juice, clue 12). House 1: Kools. House 2: Chesterfield (adjacent to fox in House 1). House 3: Old Gold (snails, clue 6). House 4: Parliament? No, clue 13 says Japanese smoke Parliament. So House 3: Japanese, Old Gold. But clue 13 requires Japanese to smoke Parliament. Contradiction. Therefore, House 3 must be Japanese, Parliament. But then Old Gold must be in House 4. House 4: Spanish, green, coffee, Old Gold, dog. But clue 6 says Old Gold smoker has snails. Conflict.

This seems impossible. Where's the mistake? Maybe House 3's pet is snails despite being Japanese. Let's try:

House 3: Japanese, ivory, milk, Parliament, snails. But clue 6 says Old Gold smoker has snails. Therefore, House 3 can't have snails unless they smoke Old Gold. But they smoke Parliament. So this is invalid.

Ah! The error is in assuming House 3's pet is snails. Let's correct. House 3's pet must be something else. The remaining pets after dog (House 4), fox (House 1), horse (House 2), are zebra and snails. If House 3 has snails, they must smoke Old Gold (clue 6). But House 3 is Japanese and must smoke Parliament (clue 13). Therefore, House 3 cannot have snails. Therefore, snails must be in House 5. But House 5 is English, red, orange juice, Lucky Strike. Cigar is Lucky Strike, so can't be Old Gold. Therefore, snails must be in House 5, but they don't have Old Gold. Contradiction.

This suggests a fundamental flaw in my previous assumptions. Maybe the initial color assignment is wrong. Let me try a different color arrangement where green and ivory are in Houses 4 and 5. For example:

1: yellow

2: blue

3: ivory

4: green

5: red

But this is the same as before. Alternatively:

1: ivory

2: green

3: blue

4: yellow

5: red

But clue 14 requires House 2 to be blue. So this doesn't work.

Wait, clue 14 says Norwegian is next to blue. If Norwegian is in House 1, then House 2 must be blue. Therefore, the color arrangement must start with House 2 as blue. Hence, the only possible color order with green right of ivory is Houses 3 and 4 as ivory and green.

Given that, I must accept that there's a conflict in the cigars and pets. Perhaps the error is in assuming House 5's nationality is English. Let me check clue 1 again: English likes red. So wherever English is, that house is red. If House 5 is red, then English is there. But then Japanese must be in House 4 or 3. Let's try:

House 5: English, red, orange juice, Lucky Strike.

House 4: Japanese, green, coffee, Parliament.

Clue 13 satisfied (Japanese smokes Parliament). Then House 4: Japanese, green, coffee, Parliament. Pet? Available pets: dog, zebra. Clue 2: Spanish owns dog. So Spanish must be in another house. House 3: ivory, milk. Nationality Spanish. Then House 3: Spanish, ivory, milk, cigar? Remaining cigars: Old Gold and Chesterfield. If House 3 smokes Old Gold, then pet is snails (clue 6). So House 3: Spanish, ivory, milk, Old Gold, snails. Then House 4: Japanese, green, coffee, Parliament, pet? Dog is with Spanish (House 3), fox in House 1, horse in House 2, remaining is zebra. House 4's pet is zebra. Then House 5's pet is what's left? All pets assigned: dog (3), fox (1), horse (2), snails (3), zebra (4). Wait, duplicate snails in House 3. No, House 3 has snails, House 4 zebra, House 5 has no pet left. That can't be. Therefore, missing a pet.

Wait, pets are dog, fox, zebra, horse, snails. Assigning:

House 1: fox

House 2: horse

House 3: snails

House 4: zebra

House 5: dog

But clue 2 says Spanish owns dog. Spanish is in House 3, but House 5 has dog. Conflict. Therefore, this is incorrect.

Back to the drawing board. Let's try:

House 1: Norwegian, yellow, Kools, water, fox (clue 10: Chesterfield next to fox).

House 2: Ukrainian, blue, tea, Chesterfield, horse (clue 11: Kools next to horse).

House 3: Spanish, ivory, milk, Old Gold, snails (clue 6).

House 4: English, green, coffee, Lucky Strike, dog (clue 2: Spanish owns dog, but Spanish is in House 3). Conflict.

Wait, clue 2 says Spanish owns dog. So if House 3 is Spanish, their pet is dog. But House 3 has snails. Contradiction. Therefore, House 4 must be Spanish, dog. So:

House 4: Spanish, green, coffee, cigar?, dog.

Cigars left: Lucky Strike, Parliament.

House 5: English, red, orange juice, Lucky Strike (clue 12).

House 5's cigar: Lucky Strike.

House 4's cigar: Parliament, but clue 13 says Japanese smoke Parliament. So House 4 can't be Spanish and smoke Parliament. Therefore, House 4's cigar is... what's left? Old Gold and Parliament. If House 4 is Spanish, dog, they can't smoke Parliament (must be Japanese). So House 4 smokes Old Gold. But clue 6 says Old Gold smoker has snails. Conflict.

This is impossible. I must be missing something. Let's recap:

Nationalities:

1: Norwegian

2: Ukrainian

3: ?

4: ?

5: English

Colors:

1: yellow

2: blue

3: ivory

4: green

5: red

Beverages:

1: water

2: tea

3: milk

4: coffee

5: orange juice

Cigars:

1: Kools

2: Chesterfield

3: ?

4: ?

5: Lucky Strike

Pets:

1: fox

2: horse

3: ?

4: dog

5: ?

Clue 6: Old Gold smoker has snails. So House 3 or 5 must have Old Gold and snails.

Clue 13: Japanese smoke Parliament. So Japanese must be in House 3 or 4.

If House 3 is Japanese, Parliament, then their pet must be snails (but need Old Gold). Conflict.

If House 4 is Japanese, Parliament, then House 4's pet is zebra or something else. But House 4 is Spanish (clue 2 says Spanish owns dog, which is in House 4). So House 4 can't be Japanese. Therefore, Japanese must be in House 3.

House 3: Japanese, ivory, milk, Parliament, pet snails. But clue 6 requires Old Gold for snails. Conflict.

Therefore, the only solution is that House 3 smokes Old Gold and has snails, but then they can't be Japanese. So House 3 must be Spanish, but clue 2 says Spanish owns dog. Therefore, House 4 must be Spanish, dog, leaving House 3 as Japanese. But this creates a conflict with Parliament.

This puzzle seems impossible, but I know there's a solution. Let me look back at the step-by-step solution I provided earlier and see where I went wrong.

Wait, in my initial solution, I had:

House 1: Norwegian, yellow, water, Kools, fox

House 2: Ukrainian, blue, tea, Chesterfield, horse

House 3: English, red, milk, Old Gold, snails

But wait, clue 1 says English likes red. So House 3 can't be English if House 5 is English. Wait, no, in the initial solution, House 3 is English, red. But clue 8 says milk is in the middle (House 3), which matches. But then House 5's nationality would be Japanese. Let me check:

In that solution:

House 5: Japanese, green, coffee, Parliament, zebra.

Wait, but clue 3 says coffee drinker likes green, which matches. Clue 5: green is right of ivory. But in that solution, House 4 is ivory. So green (House 5) is to the right of ivory (House 4). That works. Clue 14: Norwegian (1) next to blue (2). Yes.

Clue 10: Chesterfield (2) next to fox (1). Yes.

Clue 11: Kools (1) next to horse (2). Yes.

Clue 13: Japanese (5) smokes Parliament. Yes.

Clue 6: Old Gold (3) owns snails. Yes.

Clue 2: Spanish (4) owns dog. Yes.

Clue 12: Lucky Strike (4) drinks orange juice. Yes.

Clue 7: Kools (1) likes yellow. Yes.

Clue 1: English (3) likes red. Wait, House 3's color is red? But in the color arrangement, House 3 is red, which conflicts with clue 5 where green is right of ivory. Wait, in that solution, colors are:

1: yellow

2: blue

3: red

4: ivory

5: green

But clue 5 requires green to be right of ivory, which would mean ivory in 4 and green in 5, which matches. But clue 1 says English likes red, so House 3 is English and red. That works. Then the color order is:

1: yellow

2: blue

3: red

4: ivory

5: green

But clue 5 says green is to the right of ivory, which would require ivory to be in 4 and green in 5. That's correct. So the color arrangement is valid.

Thus, the correct solution is:

#############

|        |       1         |    2           |    3         |    4         |    5         |

| nationality | Norwegian      | Ukrainian     | English      | Spanish      | Japanese     |

| color  | yellow          | blue          | red          | ivory        | green        |

| beverage | water           | tea           | milk         | orange-juice | coffee       |

| cigar  | Kools           | Chesterfield  | Old Gold     | Lucky Strike | Parliament   |

| pet    | fox             | horse         | snails       | dog          | zebra        |

#############

Wait, but in this arrangement, House 4's beverage is orange juice (Lucky Strike, clue 12), and House 5's beverage is coffee (clue 3, green). That matches. Also, House 3 has milk (clue 8). Everything checks out. I think I initially confused the placement of red and ivory, but this arrangement satisfies all clues.
