R1-Einstein-orig_NL-1	"Okay, let's tackle this logic puzzle. It's one of those classic Einstein-style puzzles where we have to match different attributes across five houses. The table has columns 1 to 5, and rows for color, nationality, pet, beverage, and cigar. The goal is to figure out who owns the fish, but I think the main task here is to fill out the entire table correctly based on the given clues.

First, I need to list out all the possible categories and their options:

- Colors: blue, green, red, white, yellow

- Nationalities: British, Danish, German, Norwegian, Swedish

- Beverages: beer, coffee, milk, tea, water

- Cigars: Bluemaster, Dunhill, Pall Mall, Prince, Blend

- Pets: cat, bird, dog, horse, fish

There are 15 clues, so I need to go through them step by step and see how they can help me place each attribute in the correct column.

Let me start by jotting down the clues:

1. The British likes red.

2. The Swedish owns the dog.

3. The Danish drinks tea.

4. Green is to the left of white.

5. Green drinks coffee.

6. Pall Mall smoker owns the bird.

7. Yellow is Dunhill smoker.

8. Milk is in the middle (so position 3).

9. Norwegian is on the far left (position 1).

10. Blend smoker is adjacent to the cat owner.

11. Horse owner is adjacent to Dunhill smoker.

12. Bluemaster smoker drinks beer.

13. German smokes Prince.

14. Norwegian is adjacent to blue.

15. Blend smoker is adjacent to water drinker.

Let me start by placing the fixed points first. Clue 9 says the Norwegian is in position 1. Clue 8 says milk is in position 3. Clue 4 mentions green is left of white, so green and white are adjacent with green on the left. Since there are five positions, possible placements for green and white could be (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5). But we need to consider other clues.

Clue 5 says the green house drinks coffee. So wherever green is, that house drinks coffee. Also, clue 4 says green is to the left of white. Let's think about possible positions for green and white.

Additionally, clue 14 says the Norwegian (position 1) is adjacent to blue. So position 2 must be blue because position 1 is Norwegian. Wait, but the Norwegian's house color might be adjacent. So if Norwegian is in 1, then house 2 must be blue. Because adjacent can only be to the right. Unless the Norwegian's house is blue, but clue 14 says the Norwegian is adjacent to blue. So the Norwegian is in 1, so blue must be in 2.

Wait, let me parse clue 14 again: the Norwegian is on the left or right of the person who likes blue. Since the Norwegian is in position 1, he can only be to the left of someone in position 2. So the person in position 2 likes blue. Therefore, house 2 is blue.

So position 1: Norwegian, and position 2: blue.

Now, let's note that. So color for position 2 is blue. Then, the colors left are green, red, white, yellow.

Clue 1: British likes red. So the British person is in the house with red color. So red is another color. Since position 2 is blue, the red must be in another position. Let's keep that in mind.

Clue 4: green is left of white. So possible positions for green and white are:

If blue is in 2, then green and white could be in 3 and 4, 4 and 5? But let's see. Also, clue 5 says green drinks coffee. And clue 8 says milk is in position 3. So the green house (wherever it is) drinks coffee, which is different from milk. So if position 3 has milk, then the green house's beverage is coffee. So green can't be in position 3, because position 3's beverage is milk. Therefore, green must be in position 2 or 4? Wait, but position 2 is blue. So green must be in position 3 or 4. But position 3's beverage is milk, so green can't be 3 because green's beverage is coffee. Therefore, green must be in position 4, and white in position 5. Because green is left of white. So green in 4, white in 5. Wait, but then green is 4, white 5. Let's check if that works.

But wait, position 3 is milk. If green is in 4, then the beverage there is coffee (clue 5). Then position 4's color is green and beverage is coffee. Then white is 5. That seems possible.

Alternatively, maybe green is in 3? But position 3's beverage is milk. So that can't be, since green's beverage is coffee. So green can't be in 3. Therefore, green must be in 4, white in 5. So colors would be:

1: Norwegian's color? Let's see. We have position 1's color remaining. The colors left after blue (2), green (4), white (5), and red (somewhere). The remaining colors are yellow and red. Wait, position 1's color could be yellow or red. But clue 1 says British likes red. So red is another color. Let's see.

If position 1 is Norwegian, then his color can't be red (unless he's British, but he's Norwegian). Clue 1 says British is red. So the British person is in the red house. So red can't be in position 1 because the Norwegian is there. Therefore, red must be in position 3 or 5 or 4? Wait, we have blue in 2, green in 4, white in 5. So remaining colors are red and yellow for positions 1 and 3. But position 1's color must be yellow or red. But the Norwegian is in 1, and clue 14 says he's adjacent to blue (position 2). If position 1's color is yellow, then clue 7 says yellow is Dunhill smoker. So position 1's cigar is Dunhill.

Wait, let's try to proceed step by step.

First, let's summarize what we have so far:

Position 1: Nationality Norwegian, color (either yellow or red?), but clue 14 says adjacent to blue (position 2 is blue), so that's okay. But color of position 1 can't be red because the British person is in red. So if red is in, say, position 3, then the British would be in position 3. Let me see.

Colors:

1: ?

2: blue

3: ?

4: green

5: white

But we have colors: blue, green, red, white, yellow. So remaining colors for 1 and 3 are red and yellow. But the British person is in red. So if position 3 is red, then British is in 3. Alternatively, position 1 is red, but that's Norwegian, which can't be. So red must be in 3, because position 1 is Norwegian, who can't be British. Therefore:

Position 3: red â†’ British (clue 1). So nationality in 3 is British, color red. Then position 1's color is yellow. Because the remaining colors are red and yellow, red is in 3, so 1 is yellow.

So:

1: color yellow, nationality Norwegian

2: color blue

3: color red, nationality British, beverage milk

4: color green, beverage coffee (clue 5)

5: color white

Now, beverages:

We have:

3: milk

4: coffee

So remaining beverages for 1,2,5 are beer, tea, water.

Clue 3 says Danish drinks tea. So we need to find where Danish is. Nationalities so far:

1: Norwegian

3: British

So remaining nationalities: Danish, German, Swedish.

Clue 2: Swedish owns the dog. So Swedish is in some position, and has dog.

Clue 13: German smokes Prince.

So let's proceed.

Now, let's look at the cigars. Clue 7 says yellow is Dunhill. Since position 1 is yellow, then position 1's cigar is Dunhill.

So position 1: cigar Dunhill.

Clue 11: owner of the horse is adjacent to Dunhill smoker. Since Dunhill is in 1, the horse must be in 2.

So position 2's pet is horse.

But wait, clue 2 says Swedish owns the dog. So Swedish is in some position with dog. Let's note that.

Also, clue 6: Pall Mall smoker owns the bird. So whoever smokes Pall Mall has the bird.

Clue 10: Blend smoker is adjacent to cat owner.

Clue 12: Bluemaster smoker drinks beer.

Clue 15: Blend smoker is adjacent to water drinker.

Let me try to assign beverages first. Position 1: yellow, Norwegian, Dunhill. What beverage? The beverages left for 1,2,5 are beer, tea, water. Clue 3 says Danish drinks tea. So if position 2 is Danish, then they drink tea. Let's see.

Wait, position 2's nationality: possible nationalities are Danish, German, Swedish. Since position 1 is Norwegian, 3 is British, so 2,4,5 are Danish, German, Swedish.

Clue 3: Danish drinks tea. So where is the Danish? Let's see.

If position 2 is blue, but does that affect anything? Let's consider beverages. Position 2's beverage could be tea (if Danish), but we need to check.

But position 4's beverage is coffee. Position 3 is milk. So position 2's beverage could be tea (if Danish is there) or something else.

If Danish is in position 2, then beverage is tea. Alternatively, Danish could be in 5. Let's think.

But position 5's color is white. Let's see.

Let's try to assign nationalities. Position 4's color is green, and beverage is coffee. Nationality: could be German, Swedish, or Danish. Clue 13 says German smokes Prince. So German is in a position with Prince cigar.

Clue 12: Bluemaster smoker drinks beer. So someone drinks beer and smokes Bluemaster.

Clue 5: green drinks coffee (position 4).

Clue 7: yellow (position 1) smokes Dunhill.

Clue 6: Pall Mall smoker owns bird. So need to find who smokes Pall Mall and has bird.

Clue 10: Blend smoker is adjacent to cat.

Clue 11: horse is adjacent to Dunhill (position 1), so horse is in 2.

So position 2's pet is horse.

Now, position 2 has color blue, pet horse. Nationality? Let's see possible nationalities: Danish, German, Swedish. If position 2 is Danish, then beverage is tea. Let's tentatively say position 2 is Danish, beverage tea. Then:

Position 2: nationality Danish, beverage tea, color blue, pet horse, cigar ?

Then, remaining beverages for positions 1 and 5: beer and water.

Clue 12: Bluemaster smoker drinks beer. So someone who drinks beer smokes Bluemaster.

Position 5's color is white. Let's see. If position 5 drinks beer, then smokes Bluemaster. Alternatively, position 1 or 5.

But position 1's beverage is either beer or water. Since position 1 is Norwegian, if they drink beer, then Bluemaster would be there, but position 1's cigar is Dunhill. So no. Therefore, position 5's beverage could be beer, and smokes Bluemaster. Then position 5: beverage beer, cigar Bluemaster.

Then position 1's beverage would be water.

But let's check:

If position 2 is Danish (tea), position 3 British (milk), position 4 coffee, position 5 beer. Then position 1's beverage is water. That leaves position 5's beverage as beer, which fits clue 12 (Bluemaster smoker drinks beer). So position 5: cigar Bluemaster, beverage beer.

Then, position 1: beverage water, nationality Norwegian, color yellow, cigar Dunhill, pet ?

Position 2: nationality Danish, beverage tea, color blue, pet horse, cigar ?

Position 3: nationality British, color red, beverage milk, pet ?, cigar ?

Position 4: nationality ?, color green, beverage coffee, pet ?, cigar ?

Position 5: nationality ?, color white, beverage beer, cigar Bluemaster, pet ?

Now, let's look at cigars. We have assigned:

1: Dunhill

5: Bluemaster

Remaining cigars: Pall Mall, Prince, Blend.

Clue 13: German smokes Prince. So German must be in a position with Prince cigar. Let's see which positions are left.

Nationalities remaining: German and Swedish. Position 4 and 5. Wait, position 5's nationality is either German or Swedish. But position 5's cigar is Bluemaster, so if German is supposed to smoke Prince, then German can't be in position 5. Therefore, German must be in position 4. So position 4: nationality German, cigar Prince. But clue 13 says German is Prince smoker. So yes.

So:

Position 4: nationality German, cigar Prince.

Now, remaining nationality is Swedish, which must be in position 5. Because position 5's nationality is left (since 1:Norwegian, 2:Danish, 3:British, 4:German). So position 5: nationality Swedish.

Clue 2 says Swedish owns the dog. So position 5's pet is dog. Wait, but earlier I thought Swedish is in position 5, but clue 2 says Swedish owns the dog. Wait, position 5's pet would be dog. But let me check:

Position 5: nationality Swedish, color white, beverage beer, cigar Bluemaster, pet dog. That fits clue 2.

Now, let's check the pets. So far:

Position 2: horse

Position 5: dog

Remaining pets: cat, bird, fish.

Clue 6: Pall Mall smoker owns the bird. So someone smokes Pall Mall and has bird.

Looking at remaining cigars: Pall Mall and Blend.

Positions 3 and 4's cigars: Position 3 has not been assigned yet. Position 4: Prince (German). So position 3's cigar is either Pall Mall or Blend. Position 2's cigar is still unassigned (cigars left: Pall Mall and Blend). Let's see.

Clue 10: Blend smoker is adjacent to cat owner. So if someone smokes Blend, their neighbor has the cat.

Clue 15: Blend smoker is adjacent to water drinker. Position 1 drinks water (Norwegian), so if position 2 smokes Blend, then position 2 is adjacent to position 1 (water). But position 2's beverage is tea, not water. Wait, clue 15 says the Blend smoker is adjacent to someone who drinks water. Position 1 drinks water, so if position 2 smokes Blend, they are adjacent to position 1 (water drinker). That fits. Then position 2's cigar is Blend, and they are adjacent to water drinker (position 1). Then according to clue 10, Blend smoker (position 2) is adjacent to cat owner. So the cat must be in position 1 or 3. Position 1's pet is unknown. Let's check:

If position 2 smokes Blend, then adjacent (position 1 or 3) must have cat. Position 1's pet could be cat, or position 3's.

But position 3's pet is still unknown. Let's see.

Also, position 6: Pall Mall smoker has bird. So if position 3's cigar is Pall Mall, then their pet is bird.

Let's try assigning position 3's cigar to Pall Mall. Then:

Position 3: cigar Pall Mall, pet bird (clue 6). Then position 3's pet is bird. Then remaining pets are cat and fish in positions 1 and 4.

But position 4's pet: ?

If position 2's cigar is Blend, then according to clue 10, adjacent to cat owner. So either position 1 or 3 has cat. If position 3 has bird, then position 1 must have cat. So position 1's pet is cat. Then position 4's pet is fish. But let's check.

So:

Position 1: pet cat

Position 3: pet bird

Position 4: pet fish?

Wait, but the remaining pets are cat, bird, fish. Wait, position 2 has horse, 5 has dog. So remaining are cat, bird, fish. If position 3 has bird (from Pall Mall), then positions 1 and 4 have cat and fish.

If position 1 has cat (as per above), then position 4 has fish. That leaves fish in position 4. So the answer would be that the German (position 4) owns the fish. But wait, the puzzle is about who owns the fish, but maybe in this setup, the fish is in position 4.

Wait, let's check:

Pets:

1: cat

2: horse

3: bird

4: fish

5: dog

Yes, that uses all pets: cat, bird, dog, horse, fish.

But let's verify all clues.

Clue 10: Blend smoker (position 2) is adjacent to cat owner (position 1). Yes.

Clue 15: Blend smoker (position 2) is adjacent to water drinker (position 1). Yes.

Clue 11: Horse owner (position 2) is adjacent to Dunhill smoker (position 1). Yes.

Clue 6: Pall Mall smoker (position 3) owns bird. Yes.

Clue 7: Yellow (position 1) is Dunhill smoker. Yes.

Clue 13: German (position 4) smokes Prince. Yes.

Clue 12: Bluemaster smoker (position 5) drinks beer. Yes.

Clue 3: Danish (position 2) drinks tea. Yes.

Clue 2: Swedish (position 5) owns dog. Yes.

Clue 1: British (position 3) likes red. Yes.

Clue 4: Green (position 4) is left of white (position 5). Yes.

Clue 5: Green (position 4) drinks coffee. Yes.

Clue 8: Milk in position 3. Yes.

Clue 9: Norwegian in position 1. Yes.

Clue 14: Norwegian (position 1) adjacent to blue (position 2). Yes.

All clues seem to be satisfied. Therefore, the final arrangement is:

Position 1:

Color: Yellow

Nationality: Norwegian

Pet: Cat

Beverage: Water

Cigar: Dunhill

Position 2:

Color: Blue

Nationality: Danish

Pet: Horse

Beverage: Tea

Cigar: Blend

Position 3:

Color: Red

Nationality: British

Pet: Bird

Beverage: Milk

Cigar: Pall Mall

Position 4:

Color: Green

Nationality: German

Pet: Fish

Beverage: Coffee

Cigar: Prince

Position 5:

Color: White

Nationality: Swedish

Pet: Dog

Beverage: Beer

Cigar: Bluemaster

So the German in position 4 owns the fish.

R1-Einstein-orig_NL-2	"Okay, let me try to work through this logic puzzle step by step. So, there are five houses in a row, each with different attributes: color, nationality, pet, beverage, and cigar brand. The goal is to fill out the table correctly based on the given clues. Let me list out all the clues first to keep them in mind.

1. The British person likes red.

2. The Swedish person owns the dog.

3. The Danish person drinks tea.

4. The person who likes green is to the left of the person who likes white.

5. The person who likes green drinks coffee.

6. The Pall Mall smoker owns the bird.

7. The person who likes yellow smokes Dunhill.

8. The person drinking milk is in the middle (so house 3).

9. The Norwegian is on the far left (house 1).

10. The Blend smoker is adjacent to the owner of the cat.

11. The horse owner is adjacent to the Dunhill smoker.

12. The Bluemaster smoker drinks beer.

13. The German smokes Prince.

14. The Norwegian is adjacent to the person who likes blue.

15. The Blend smoker is adjacent to the person who drinks water.

Alright, let's start by placing the fixed clues. Clue 9 says the Norwegian is in house 1. Clue 8 says milk is in house 3. So let's note that:

House 1: Nationality - Norwegian; Beverage - ? (but not milk)

House 3: Beverage - Milk

Clue 14 says Norwegian (house 1) is adjacent to someone who likes blue. So house 2 must be blue, since house 1 can't be blue (they are adjacent). Wait, house 1's color? Let's see. The colors are blue, green, red, white, yellow. So house 1 is either yellow, blue, etc. But clue 14 says Norwegian (house1) is next to blue. So house2 must be blue. So:

House 2: Color - Blue

Clue 1: British likes red. So the British person must be in a house with red color. Let's see where red can be. The colors left are green, red, white, yellow (since blue is in house2). Clue 4 says green is left of white, so green must come before white. So possible positions for green and white could be 3 and 4, 4 and5, etc., but since green must be left of white. Also, clue5 says green drinks coffee. So the green house's beverage is coffee.

Clue 5: Green drinks coffee. So the green house must be in a position where coffee is their beverage. Beverages are beer, coffee, milk, tea, water. Milk is in house3. So coffee is in another house. Let's think about possible placement of green and white. Since green is left of white, and house2 is blue, maybe green is in house4 and white in5? But let's check.

Alternatively, if green is in house3, then white would be in4 or5. But house3's beverage is milk (clue8), so green can't be in house3 because clue5 says green drinks coffee. Therefore, green must be in house4, white in5. Because then house4's beverage would be coffee (clue5). Let's tentatively assign:

House4: Color - Green; Beverage - Coffee

House5: Color - White

That leaves house1 and house3. The remaining colors are red and yellow. Clue1 says British like red. So the British person must be in a house with red. Let's see where red can be. If house3 is red, then the British would be there. But house3's beverage is milk. Let's check if that's possible. Alternatively, house1 could be red, but then the British would be in house1, but house1 is Norwegian. So no. Therefore, house3 can't be red because the British are in the red house. So house3 must be yellow? Wait, no, the colors left are red and yellow. If house1 is yellow, then clue7 says yellow is Dunhill smoker. Let's try that.

House1: Color - Yellow; Nationality - Norwegian; Beverage - ?

House2: Color - Blue

House3: Color - Red? But then British must be here. Wait, house3's nationality would be British. Let me check.

Wait, if house3 is red, then nationality is British (clue1). House3's beverage is milk. Then, house1: Norwegian, color yellow (since adjacent to blue), smokes Dunhill (clue7). So:

House1: Color - Yellow; Nationality - Norwegian; Cigar - Dunhill; Beverage - ?

House2: Color - Blue; Nationality - ?; Beverage - ?

House3: Color - Red; Nationality - British; Beverage - Milk; Cigar - ?

House4: Color - Green; Beverage - Coffee; Nationality - ?

House5: Color - White; Nationality - ?

Now, clue3: Danish drinks tea. So we need to find where tea is. Beverages left are tea, water, beer (since milk in3, coffee in4). House1's beverage: could be water or beer. House2: beverage? House5's beverage? Let's think.

Clue12: Bluemaster smoker drinks beer. So beer is in some house where the cigar is Bluemaster. Clue13: German smokes Prince. So German is in a house with Prince.

Clue2: Swedish owns the dog. So Swedish is in house5 (since house5 is white, and we have nationalities: Norwegian, British, Danish, German, Swedish). Let's see. Nationalities left for houses2,4,5: Danish, German, Swedish.

If house3 is British (red), then house5 could be Swedish (owns dog). So:

House5: Nationality - Swedish; Pet - Dog; Color - White; Beverage - ?

Clue12: If someone drinks beer, they smoke Bluemaster. So house5's beverage could be beer, and cigar Bluemaster. Let's check:

House5: Beverage - Beer; Cigar - Bluemaster (clue12)

That leaves beverages in house1 and 2: tea and water. Clue3: Danish drinks tea. So the Danish must be in a house where beverage is tea. So if house2's nationality is Danish, then their beverage is tea. So:

House2: Nationality - Danish; Beverage - Tea; Pet - ?

Clue3 is satisfied. Then house1's beverage would be water (remaining). So:

House1: Beverage - Water

Now, check clue15: Blend smoker is adjacent to water drinker. So Blend smoker must be next to house1 (water). So house2's cigar could be Blend. Let's check.

House2: Cigar - Blend

Then, clue10 says Blend smoker is adjacent to cat owner. So the cat must be in house1 or 3. Let's see. House2's neighbor is house1 or 3. If Blend is in house2, then cat is in house1 or3.

House1's pet: possible cat. Let's assign:

House1: Pet - Cat

Then, clue10 is satisfied. Now, moving on.

Clue6: Pall Mall smoker owns the bird. So we need to find where Pall Mall is. The cigars used so far: Dunhill (house1), Blend (house2), Bluemaster (house5). Remaining cigars: Pall Mall and Prince.

Clue13: German smokes Prince. So German is in a house with Prince. The remaining nationalities are German and Swedish (Swedish is in5). So German must be in house4. So:

House4: Nationality - German; Cigar - Prince (clue13)

But wait, Prince is a cigar, and clue13 says German smokes Prince. So house4's cigar is Prince. Then, the remaining cigar is Pall Mall, which must be in house3. So:

House3: Cigar - Pall Mall

Clue6: Pall Mall smoker owns the bird. So house3's pet is bird.

House3: Pet - Bird

Now, pets left are fish and horse. House4 and5: house5 has dog, so house4's pet? Remaining are fish and horse. Let's see.

Clue11: Horse owner is adjacent to Dunhill smoker. Dunhill is in house1. So the horse owner must be in house2. Because house1's neighbor is house2. So:

House2: Pet - Horse

Then, the remaining pet is fish in house4.

House4: Pet - Fish

Now, check all clues:

1. British (house3) likes red (yes, house3 is red).

2. Swedish (house5) owns dog (yes).

3. Danish (house2) drinks tea (yes).

4. Green (house4) is left of white (house5) (yes).

5. Green (house4) drinks coffee (yes).

6. Pall Mall (house3) has bird (yes).

7. Yellow (house1) smokes Dunhill (yes).

8. Milk in house3 (yes).

9. Norwegian in house1 (yes).

10. Blend (house2) next to cat (house1) (yes).

11. Horse (house2) next to Dunhill (house1) (yes).

12. Bluemaster (house5) drinks beer (yes).

13. German (house4) smokes Prince (yes).

14. Norwegian (house1) next to blue (house2) (yes).

15. Blend (house2) next to water (house1) (yes).

All clues satisfied! Let's fill the table:

House1: Color Yellow, Nationality Norwegian, Pet Cat, Beverage Water, Cigar Dunhill

House2: Color Blue, Nationality Danish, Pet Horse, Beverage Tea, Cigar Blend

House3: Color Red, Nationality British, Pet Bird, Beverage Milk, Cigar Pall Mall

House4: Color Green, Nationality German, Pet Fish, Beverage Coffee, Cigar Prince

House5: Color White, Nationality Swedish, Pet Dog, Beverage Beer, Cigar Bluemaster

R1-Einstein-orig_NL-3	"Okay, let's tackle this logic puzzle. It's similar to the classic Einstein puzzle, so I'll need to use the clues to fill in the table step by step. Let me start by listing out all the clues and see how they connect.

First, let's note the categories: color, nationality, pet, beverage, cigar. Each house (numbered 1 to 5) has one of each category. The goal is to assign each item to the correct house based on the clues.

Clue 1: The British person likes red. So wherever British is, red must be in the color column for that house.

Clue 2: The Swedish owns the dog. So Swedish nationality corresponds to the dog in the pet column.

Clue 3: The Danish drinks tea. So Danish nationality has tea in beverage.

Clue 4: Green is to the left of white. That means green must be in a house with a lower number than white. So possible pairs could be (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5).

Clue 5: Green's person drinks coffee. So wherever green is, coffee is in beverage.

Clue 6: Pall Mall smoker owns the bird. So Pall Mall in cigars corresponds to bird in pets.

Clue 7: Yellow color is the Dunhill smoker. So yellow's house has Dunhill cigars.

Clue 8: Milk is in the middle (house 3). So beverage for house 3 is milk.

Clue 9: Norwegian is on the far left (house 1). So nationality for house 1 is Norwegian.

Clue 10: Blend smoker is adjacent to the cat owner. So Blend in cigars must be in a house next to the one with the cat.

Clue 11: Horse owner is adjacent to Dunhill smoker. So the house with the horse is next to Dunhill (which we know is in the yellow house from clue 7).

Clue 12: Bluemaster smoker drinks beer. So Bluemaster in cigars corresponds to beer in beverages.

Clue 13: German smokes Prince. So German nationality has Prince cigars.

Clue 14: Norwegian is adjacent to blue. Since Norwegian is in house 1, blue must be in house 2.

Clue 15: Blend smoker is adjacent to water drinker. So Blend in cigars is next to water in beverages.

Let's start plugging in the fixed clues first.

From clue 9: House 1 nationality is Norwegian.

From clue 14: Norwegian (house 1) is adjacent to blue. So house 2 must be blue.

From clue 4: Green is left of white. So green and white must be in consecutive houses with green first. Possible positions: (3,4), (4,5). But since blue is in house 2, the remaining colors are yellow, green, red, white. Wait, the colors are blue, green, red, white, yellow. Wait, clue 7 says yellow is in some house. So colors assigned so far: house 2 is blue. House 1's color must be either yellow or red or green or white. But clue 7: yellow's house has Dunhill. Let's see.

From clue 7: Yellow is Dunhill. So wherever yellow is, that house has Dunhill cigar. Also, clue 14 says Norwegian (house 1) is adjacent to blue (house 2), so house 1's color can't be blue. Possible colors for house 1: yellow, red, green, white. Let's check clue 1: British likes red. So red is in the same house as British. Since house 3's beverage is milk (clue 8), maybe we can find where coffee is (clue 5: green drinks coffee).

Clue 5: Green drinks coffee. So green's house has coffee. Clue 4: Green is left of white, so green could be house 3 or 4, white would be 4 or 5. But beverage in house 3 is milk, so green can't be there (since coffee is in green's house). Therefore, green must be in house 4, white in 5. Then coffee is in house 4's beverage. That leaves house 3's beverage as milk (clue 8), which fits. So:

House 4: color green, beverage coffee.

House 5: color white.

Now, house 1's color: remaining colors are yellow and red. Clue 1: British likes red. So if house 3 is red, then nationality there is British. Let's see. Let's tentatively assign house 1's color as yellow (since clue 7 says yellow is Dunhill). So:

House 1: color yellow, cigar Dunhill (clue 7), nationality Norwegian (clue 9).

House 2: color blue (from clue 14).

House 3: color red (since British must be here per clue 1), nationality British.

House 4: color green, beverage coffee.

House 5: color white.

Now, nationalities: Norwegian (1), British (3), remaining are Danish, German, Swedish. Let's use clue 3: Danish drinks tea. So find where tea is. Beverages so far: house 3 has milk, house 4 has coffee. House 1's beverage is unknown. House 2 and 5 are left. From clue 15: Blend smoker is adjacent to water. Also, clue 10: Blend is adjacent to cat. Let's try to place the beverages. Remaining beverages: beer, tea, water. Clue 12: Bluemaster smoker drinks beer, so house with Bluemaster has beer. Clue 13: German smokes Prince. So German's house has Prince cigar.

Nationality assignments: house 1: Norwegian, house 3: British. Houses 2,4,5: Danish, German, Swedish. Clue 2: Swedish owns dog. So Swedish must be in house 5 (since color white is there, and house 5's pet is dog). So:

House 5: nationality Swedish, pet dog, color white.

Then remaining nationalities for house 2 and 4: Danish and German. Clue 3: Danish drinks tea. So Danish's beverage is tea. Let's see, house 2 or 4. House 4's beverage is coffee, so Danish must be in house 2. Therefore:

House 2: nationality Danish, beverage tea.

House 4: nationality German, since that's the only one left. And clue 13: German smokes Prince. So house 4's cigar is Prince.

Now, cigars: house 1: Dunhill (clue 7), house 4: Prince (clue 13). Remaining cigars: Bluemaster, Pall Mall, Blend. House 5's beverage: remaining beverages are beer and water. Clue 12: Bluemaster smoker drinks beer. So if house 5's beverage is beer, then their cigar is Bluemaster. So:

House 5: beverage beer, cigar Bluemaster.

That leaves house 2 and 3 for Pall Mall and Blend. Clue 6: Pall Mall smoker owns bird. So Pall Mall is in a house with bird as pet. Let's see. House 3's pet is unknown. If Pall Mall is in house 3, then pet is bird. Then house 3: cigar Pall Mall, pet bird. Then house 2's cigar would be Blend. Let's check clue 10: Blend smoker is next to cat. If house 2 has Blend, then adjacent houses (1 and 3) must have cat. House 1's pet is unknown. If house 1 has cat, then Blend (house 2) is next to cat (house 1), which works. Then:

House 1: pet cat.

House 2: cigar Blend.

House 3: cigar Pall Mall, pet bird.

House 4: cigar Prince.

House 5: cigar Bluemaster.

Now, pets: house 1: cat, house 2: ?, house 3: bird, house 4: ?, house 5: dog. Remaining pets: horse and fish. Clue 11: Horse owner is adjacent to Dunhill smoker. Dunhill is in house 1, so horse must be in house 2. Therefore:

House 2: pet horse.

Then house 4's pet must be fish. So:

House 4: pet fish.

Now, beverages: house 1: needs to be water or something else. The remaining beverages are water and maybe others. Let's check. House 1's beverage: remaining are water and maybe others. Let's see. Beverages assigned: house 2: tea, house 3: milk, house 4: coffee, house 5: beer. So only house 1 needs water. So:

House 1: beverage water.

Check clue 15: Blend smoker (house 2) is adjacent to water drinker (house 1). That works.

Now, let's check all clues:

1. British (house 3) likes red (yes, house 3 is red).

2. Swedish (house 5) owns dog (yes).

3. Danish (house 2) drinks tea (yes).

4. Green (house 4) is left of white (house 5) (yes).

5. Green (4) drinks coffee (yes).

6. Pall Mall (house 3) has bird (yes).

11. Horse (2) next to Dunhill (1) (yes).

12. Bluemaster (5) drinks beer (yes).

13. German (4) smokes Prince (yes).

14. Norwegian (1) next to blue (2) (yes).

15. Blend (2) next to water (1) (yes).

All clues satisfied. The fish is in house 4, owned by German. So the final table should be:

House 1: yellow, Norwegian, cat, water, Dunhill

House 2: blue, Danish, horse, tea, Blend

House 3: red, British, bird, milk, Pall Mall

House 4: green, German, fish, coffee, Prince
